a-fish-story,1,"Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived
anywhere except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to
the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you
would learn something quite different. They would tell you that long,
long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to
place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes
are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how
clever they were to do it. Indeed, so clever were they that they might
have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened."
a-fish-story,2,"One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting
expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch
their camp. It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find
a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which
grew by the bank of a river. So they made their fire to cook some food,
right on the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying
beneath it at the bottom. While the food was cooking they all stretched
themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to
sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over
the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was
almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage
countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it
again. To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor
fishes were chilled right through their bodies.

'This will never do,' said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe. 'We
shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again,' and he bade his
sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though
they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce."
a-fish-story,3,"'Let me try,' cried Biernuga, the bony fish, but he had no better luck,
and no more had Kumbal, the bream, nor any of the rest.

'It is no use,' exclaimed Thuggai, at last. 'The wood is too wet. We
must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it.'
Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the
youngest of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, 'Ask my
father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire. He is skilled in magic more
than most fishes.' So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces
of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes.
Then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while,
till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges
of the bark showed signs of curling up. When the rest of the tribe saw
this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind,
but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the
wind to fan his fire. By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry
crackling was heard."
a-fish-story,4,"'More wood,' cried Guddhi, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped
it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered.

'We shall soon be warm now,' said the people one to another. 'Truly
Guddhu is great'; and they crowded round again, closer and closer.
Suddenly, with a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills
and blew the fire out towards them. They sprang back hurriedly, quite
forgetting where they stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling
over the other, till they rolled into the pool that lay below. Oh, how
cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone! Then in an
instant they felt warm again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind,
had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned
as brightly as ever. And the fishes gathered round it as they had done
on the top of the cliff, and found the flames as hot as before, and that
fire never went out, like those upon land, but kept burning for ever.
So now you know why, if you dive deep down below the cold surface of
the water on a frosty day, you will find it comfortable and pleasant
underneath, and be quite sorry that you cannot stay there."
a-french-puck,1,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France
there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play
tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys.
They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself
into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed,
there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a
needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as
he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would
have found him out at once, and this he knew.

Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will
call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the
shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound
asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that
fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang
to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the
cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves
wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they
returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on
till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting
together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take
the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck,
hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying
himself amazingly all the time."
a-french-puck,2,"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing
along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating
loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he
had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So
he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it
could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on
his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and
staggered along as best he could under his load.

'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue
of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and
made him jump.

'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered:

'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.'

In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was
running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he
went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears.
Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear! What fun
I have had, to be sure!'"
a-french-puck,3,"Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but
visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he
should be the next victim. After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and
shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport.
At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest
town to buy all that they needed for setting up house. Quite certain
that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck
waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their
return journey. He changed himself into a fly in order to overhear
their conversation.

For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next
month, and who were to be invited. This led the bride to her wedding
dress, and she gave a little scream.

'Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the
different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!'

'Dear, dear!' exclaimed the young man. 'That is unlucky. Didn't you
tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?'

'Yes, I did,' and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which
had quite a different sound from the first. 'Look! Look!'"
a-french-puck,4,"The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball
of thread of all colours. All the colours, that is, of the dresses
that were tied on to the back of the cart.

'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he
sprang out to get it. 'One would think a fairy had put it there on
purpose.'

'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl. As she spoke she seemed to hear
an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was
nonsense.

The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. It
matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or
broke perpetually, as most thread did. She finished her work much
quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come
to the church and see her in her wedding dress.

There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony. The young
people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents
were very rich. The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from
afar, walking under the chestnut avenue."
a-french-puck,5,"'What a beautiful girl!' exclaimed the men. 'What a lovely dress!'
whispered the women. But just as she entered the church and took the
hand of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard.

'Crick! crack! Crick! crack!' and the wedding garments fell to the
ground, to the great confusion of the wearer.

Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! Cloaks
in profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so
upset that she could hardly keep from tears. One of the guests, more
curious than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined,
if she could, to find out the cause of the disaster.

'The thread must have been rotten,' she said to herself. 'I will see if
I can break it.' But search as she would she could find none.

The thread had vanished!"
a-legend-of-confucius,1,"When Confucius came to the earth, the Kilin, that strange beast which
is the prince of all four-footed animals, and only appears when there
is a great man on earth, sought the child and spat out a jade whereon
was written: ""Son of the Watercrystal you are destined to become an
uncrowned king!"" And Confucius grew up, studied diligently, learned
wisdom and came to be a saint. He did much good on earth, and ever
since his death has been reverenced as the greatest of teachers and
masters. He had foreknowledge of many things. And even after he had
died he gave evidence of this."
a-legend-of-confucius,2,"Once, when the wicked Emperor Tsin Schi Huang had conquered all the
other kingdoms, and was traveling through the entire empire, he came
to the homeland of Confucius. And he found his grave. And, finding his
grave, he wished to have it opened and see what was in it. All his
officials advised him not to do so, but he would not listen to them.
So a passage was dug into the grave, and in its main chamber they
found a coffin, whose wood appeared to be quite fresh. When struck it
sounded like metal."
a-legend-of-confucius,3,"To the left of the coffin was a door, which led
into an inner chamber. In this chamber stood a bed, and a table with
books and clothing, all as though meant for the use of a living
person. Tsin Schi Huang seated himself on the bed and looked down. And
there on the floor stood two shoes of red silk, whose tips were
adorned with a woven pattern of clouds. A bamboo staff leaned against
the wall. The Emperor, in jest, put on the shoes, took the staff and
left the grave."
a-legend-of-confucius,4,"But as he did so a tablet suddenly appeared before his
eyes on which stood the following lines:

    O'er kingdoms six Tsin Schi Huang his army led,
    To ope my grave and find my humble bed;
    He steals my shoes and takes my staff away
    To reach Schakiu--and his last earthly day!"
a-legend-of-confucius,5,"Tsin Schi Huang was much alarmed, and had the grave closed again. But
when he reached Schakiu he fell ill of a hasty fever of which he died."
a-legend-of-knockmany,1,"It so happened that Finn and his gigantic relatives were all working at
the Giant's Causeway in order to make a bridge, or, what was still
better, a good stout pad-road across to Scotland. Finn, who was
very fond of his wife, Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go
home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence. So accordingly he
pulled up a fir-tree, and after lopping off the roots and branches, made
a walking-stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh.

Finn lived at this time on Knockmany Hill, which faces Cullamore, that
rises up, half hill, half mountain, on the opposite side.

The truth is that honest Finn's affection for his wife was by no manner
of means the whole cause of his journey home. There was at that time
another giant, named Far Rua--some say he was Irish and some say he was
Scotch--but whether Scotch or Irish, sorrow doubt of it but he was a
targer. No other giant of the day could stand before him. Such
was his strength that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook
the country about him. The fame and name of him went far and near, and
nothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a
fight. Whether the story is true or not I cannot say, but the report
went that by one blow of his fist he flattened a thunderbolt, and kept
it in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies
when they were about to fight him."
a-legend-of-knockmany,2,"Undoubtedly he had given every giant
in Ireland a considerable beating, barring Finn M'Coul himself. He
swore that he would never rest night or day, winter or summer, till he
could serve Finn with the same sauce, if he could catch him. Finn,
however, had a strong disinclination to meet a giant who could make a
young earthquake or flatten a thunderbolt when he was angry. Accordingly he kept dodging about from place to place--not much to his
credit as a Trojan, to be sure--whenever he happened to get the hard
word that Far Rua was on the scent of him. And the long and the short of
it was that he heard Far Rua was coming to the Causeway to have a trial
of strength with him. He was, naturally enough, seized in
consequence with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife,
who was delicate in her health, poor woman. She was leading, besides, a very
lonely, uncomfortable life of it in his absence.

""God save all here,"" said Finn good-humouredly, putting his honest face
into his own door.

""Musha, Finn, avick, an' you're welcome to your own Oonagh, you darlin'
bully."" Here followed a smack that it is said to have made the waters of
the lake curl, as it were, with kindness and sympathy."
a-legend-of-knockmany,3,"""Faith,"" said Finn, ""beautiful; and how are you, Oonagh--and how did
you sport your figure during my absence, my bilberry?""

""Never a merrier--as bouncing a grass widow as ever there was in sweet
'Tyrone among the bushes.'""

Finn gave a short, good-humoured cough. He laughed most heartily to
show her how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his
absence.

""An' what brought you home so soon, Finn?"" said she.

""Why, avourneen,"" said Finn, putting in his answer in the proper way,
""never the thing but the purest of love and affection for yourself.
Sure, you know that's truth, anyhow, Oonagh.""

Finn spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very
comfortable considering the dread he had of Far Rua. This, however, grew
upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on
his mind which he kept altogether to himself. Let a woman alone in the
meantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when
she wishes. Finn was a proof of this.

""It's this Far Rua,"" said he, ""that's troublin' me. When the fellow gets
angry and begins to stamp he'll shake you a whole townland. It's
well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always carries one
about with him in the shape of a pancake to show to anyone that might
misdoubt it.""

As he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth, as he always did when he
wanted to prophesy or to know anything.

""He's coming,"" said Finn. ""I see him below at Dungannon.""

""An' who is it, avick?""

""Far Rua,"" replied Finn, ""and how to manage I don't know. If I run away
I am disgraced, and I know that sooner or later I must meet him, for my
thumb tells me so."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,4,"""When will he be here?"" says she.

""To-morrow, about two o'clock,"" replied Finn with a groan.

""Don't be cast down,"" said Oonagh. ""Depend on me, and, maybe, I'll bring
you out of this scrape better than ever you could bring yourself.""

This quieted Finn's heart very much, for he knew that Oonagh was
hand-and-glove with the fairies. Indeed, to tell the truth, she was
supposed to be a fairy herself. If she was, however, she must have been
a kind-hearted one, for by all accounts she never did anything but good
in the neighbourhood.

Now, it so happened that Oonagh had a sister named Granua living
opposite to them, on the very top of Cullamore, which I have mentioned
already. This Granua was quite as powerful as herself. The beautiful
valley that lies between the Granlisses is not more than three or four
miles broad, so that of a summer evening Granua and Oonagh were able to
hold many an agreeable conversation across it, from one hill-top to the
other. Upon this occasion Oonagh resolved to consult her sister as to
what was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them.

""Granua,"" said she, ""are you at home?""

""No,"" said the other, ""I'm picking bilberries at Althadhawan"" (the
Devil's Glen).

""Well,"" said Oonagh, ""go up to the top of Cullamore, look about you, and
then tell us what you see.""

""Very well,"" replied Granua, after a few minutes; ""I am there now.""

""What do you see?"" asked the other.

""Goodness be about us!"" exclaimed Granua, ""I see the biggest giant that
ever was known coming up from Dungannon.""

""Ay,"" said Oonagh, ""there's our difficulty. That's Far Rua, and he's
comin' up now to leather Finn. What's to be done?"""
a-legend-of-knockmany,5,"""I'll call to him,"" she replied, ""to come up to Cullamore and refresh
himself, and maybe that will give you and Finn time to think of some
plan to get yourselves out of the scrape. But,"" she proceeded, ""I'm
short of butter, having in the house only half a dozen firkins, and as
I'm to have a few giants and giantesses to spend the evenin' with me I'd
feel thankful, Oonagh, if you'd throw me up fifteen or sixteen tubs, or
the largest miscaun you've got, and you'll oblige me very much.""

""I'll do that with a heart and a half,"" replied Oonagh; ""and, indeed,
Granua, I feel myself under great obligations to you for your kindness
in keeping him off us till we see what can be done; for what would
become of us all if anything happened to Finn, poor man!""

She accordingly got the largest miscaun of butter she had--which might
be about the weight of a couple of dozen millstones, so that you can
easily judge of its size--and calling up her sister, ""Granua,"" says she,
""are you ready? I'm going to throw you up a miscaun, so be prepared to
catch it.""

""I will,"" said the other. ""A good throw, now, and take care it does not
fall short.""

Oonagh threw it, but in consequence of her anxiety about Finn and Far
Rua she forgot to say the charm that was to send it up, so that instead
of reaching Cullamore, as she expected, it fell about half-way between
the two hills at the edge of the Broad Bog, near Augher."
a-legend-of-knockmany,6,"""My curse upon you!"" she exclaimed, ""you've disgraced me. I now change
you into a grey stone. Lie there as a testimony of what has happened,
and may evil betide the first living man that will ever attempt to move
or injure you!""

And, sure enough, there it lies to this day, with the mark of the four
fingers and thumb imprinted on it, exactly as it came out of her hand.

""Never mind,"" said Granua, ""I must only do the best I can with Far Rua.
If all fail, I'll give him a cast of heather broth, or a panada of oak
bark. But, above all things, think of some plan to get Finn out of the
scrape he's in, or he's a lost man. You know you used to be sharp and
ready-witted; and my own opinion is, Oonagh, that it will go hard with
you, or you'll outdo Far Rua yet.""

She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she put
her finger in her mouth and gave three whistles, and by that Far Rua
knew that he was invited to the top of Cullamore--for this was the way
that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to
let them know they are welcome to come and take share of whatever was
going."
a-legend-of-knockmany,7,"In the meantime Finn was very melancholy, and did not know what to do,
or how to act at all. Far Rua was an ugly customer, no doubt, to meet
with; and, moreover, the idea of the confounded ""cake"" aforesaid
flattened the very heart within him. What chance could he have, strong
and brave as he was, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk
the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? The
thing was impossible, and Finn knew not on what hand to turn him. Right
or left, backward or forward, where to go he could form no guess
whatever.

""Oonagh,"" said he, ""can you do anything for me? Where's all your
invention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to
have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and me the
best man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain--this huge
cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt--with a pancake in his
pocket that was once----?""

""Be aisy, Finn,"" replied Oonagh. ""Troth, I'm ashamed of you. Keep your
toe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe we'll give him as
good as any he brings with him--thunderbolts or otherwise. If I don't
treat him to as smart feeding as he's got this many a day, don't trust
Oonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just as I bid you."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,8,"This relieved Finn very much, for, after all, he had great confidence in
his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a
quandary before. The present, however, was the greatest of all; but,
still, he began to get courage and to eat his victuals as usual. Oonagh
then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours, which she
always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of
importance she went about. She then plaited them into three plaits, with
three colours in each, putting one on her right arm, one round her
heart, and the third round her right ankle, for then she knew that
nothing could fail her that she undertook.

Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and
borrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded into
the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she baked on the
fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the cupboard according as
they were done. She then put down a large pot of new milk, which she
made into curds and whey, and gave Finn due instructions how to use the
curds when Far Rua should come. Having done all this, she sat down quite
contented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o'clock,
that being the hour at which he was expected--for Finn knew as much by
the sucking of his thumb. Now, this was a curious property that Finn's
thumb had; but notwithstanding all the wisdom and logic he used to suck
out of it, it could never have stood to him here were it not for the wit
of his wife. In this very thing, moreover, he was very much resembled by
his great foe, Far Rua; for it was well known that the huge strength
that he possessed all lay in the middle finger of his right hand, and
that if he happened by any chance to lose it, he was no more,
notwithstanding his bulk, than a common man."
a-legend-of-knockmany,9,"At length the next day he was seen coming across the valley, and Oonagh
knew that it was time to commence operations. She immediately made the
cradle, and desired Finn to lie down in it and cover himself up with the
clothes.

""You must pass for your own child,"" said she, ""so just lie there snug
and say nothing, but be guided by me."" This, to be sure, was wormwood to
Finn--I mean going into the cradle in such a cowardly manner--but he
knew Oonagh very well; and finding that he had nothing else for it, with
a very rueful face he gathered himself into it and lay snug, as she had
desired him.

About two o'clock, as he had been expected, Far Rua came in. ""God save
all here!"" said he. ""Is this where the great Finn M'Coul lives?""

""Indeed it is, honest man,"" replied Oonagh. ""God save you kindly--won't
you be sitting?""

""Thank you, ma'am,"" says he, sitting down. ""You're Mrs. M'Coul, I
suppose?""

""I am,"" says she, ""and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my
husband.""

""No,"" said the other; ""he has the name of being the strongest and
bravest man in Ireland. But, for all that, there's a man not far from
you that's very anxious of taking a shake with him. Is he at home?""

""Why, no, then,"" she replied; ""and if ever a man left in a fury he did.
It appears that someone told him of a big bosthoon of a giant called Far
Rua being down at the Causeway to look for him, and so he set out there
to try if he could catch him. Troth, I hope, for the poor giant's sake,
he won't meet with him, for if he does Finn will make paste of him at
once.""

""Well,"" said the other, ""I am Far Rua, and I have been seeking him these
twelve minths, but he always kept clear of me; and I will never rest day
or night till I lay my hands on him."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,10,"At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh of great contempt, by the way, and
looked at him as if he were only a mere handful of a man.

""Did you ever see Finn?"" said she, changing her manner all at once.

""How could I?"" said he. ""He always took care to keep his distance.""

""I thought so,"" she replied. ""I judged as much; and if you take my
advice, you poor-looking creature, you'll pray night and day that you
may never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you when
you do. But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind's on the door,
and as Finn himself is far from home, maybe you'd be civil enough to
turn the house, for it's always what Finn does when he's here.""

This was a startler, even to Far Rua; but he got up, however, and after
pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked three
times, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house, completely
turned it as she had wished. When Finn saw this he felt a certain
description of moisture, which shall be nameless, oozing out through
every pore of his skin; but Oonagh, depending upon her woman's wit, felt
not a whit daunted.

""Arrah, then,"" said she, ""as you're so civil, maybe you'd do another
obliging turn for us, as Finn's not here to do it himself. You see,
after this long stretch of dry weather that we've had, we feel very
badly off for want of water. Now, Finn says there's a fine spring well
somewhere under the rocks behind the hill there below, and it was his
intention to pull them asunder; but having heard of you he left the
place in such a fury that he never thought of it. Now, if you try to
find it, troth, I'd feel it a kindness."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,11,"She then brought Far Rua down to see the place, which was then all one
solid rock; and after looking at it for some time, he cracked his right
middle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft about four
hundred feet deep and a quarter of a mile in length, which has since
been christened by the name of Lumford's Glen. This feat nearly threw
Oonagh herself off her guard; but what won't a woman's sagacity and
presence of mind accomplish?

""You'll now come in,"" said she, ""and eat a bit of such humble fare as we
can give. Finn, even though you and he were enemies, would scorn not to
treat you kindly in his own house; and, indeed, if I didn't do it even
in his absence, he would not be pleased with me.""

She accordingly brought him in, and placing half a dozen of the cakes we
spoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter, a side of
boiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to help
himself--for this, be it known, was long before the invention of
potatoes. Far Rua, who, by the way, was a glutton as well as a hero, put
one of the cakes in his mouth to take a huge whack out of it, when both
Finn and Oonagh were stunned with a noise that resembled something
between a growl and a yell. ""Blood and fury!"" he shouted out. ""How is
this? Here are two of my teeth out! What kind of bread is this you gave
me?""

""What's the matter?"" said Oonagh coolly.

""Matter!"" shouted the other. ""Why, here are two of the best teeth in my
head gone."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,12,"""Why,"" said she, ""that's Finn's bread--the only bread he ever eats when
at home; but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat it but
himself and that child in the cradle there. I thought, however, that as
you were reported to be rather a stout little fellow of your size you
might be able to manage it, and I did not wish to affront a man that
thinks himself able to fight Finn. Here's another cake--maybe it's not
so hard as that.""

Far Rua, at the moment, was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he
accordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately another
yell was heard twice as loud as the first. ""Thunder and giblets!"" he
roared, ""take your bread out of this, or I will not have a tooth in my
head; there's another pair of them gone.""

""Well, honest man,"" replied Oonagh, ""if you're not able to eat the bread
say so quietly, and don't be awakening the child in the cradle there.
There, now, he's awake upon me!""

Finn now gave a skirl that frightened the giant, as coming from such a
youngster as he was represented to be. ""Mother,"" said he, ""I'm
hungry--get me something to eat."" Oonagh went over, and putting into
his hand a cake that had no griddle in it--Finn, whose appetite in the
meantime was sharpened by what he saw going forward, soon made it
disappear. Far Rua was thunderstruck, and secretly thanked his stars
that he had the good fortune to miss meeting Finn, for, as he said to
himself, I'd have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that,
which even his son that's in the cradle can munch before my eyes.

""I'd like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,"" said he to
Oonagh, ""for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that
nutriment is no joke to look at or to feed of a scarce summer."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,13,"""With all the veins of my heart,"" replied Oonagh. ""Get up, acushla, and
show this decent little man something that won't be unworthy of your
father, Finn M'Coul.""

Finn, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible,
got up, and bringing Far Rua out, ""Are you strong?"" said he.

""Thunder and ounze!"" exclaimed the other, ""what a voice in so small a
chap!""

""Are you strong?"" said Finn again. ""Are you able to squeeze water out of
that white stone?"" he asked, putting one into Far Rua's hand. The latter
squeezed and squeezed the stone, but to no purpose; he might pull the
rocks of Lumford's Glen asunder, and flatten a thunderbolt, but to
squeeze water out of a white stone was beyond his strength. Finn eyed
him with great contempt as he kept straining and squeezing and squeezing
and straining till he got black in the face with the efforts.

""Ah, you're a poor creature,"" said Finn. ""You a giant! Give me the stone
here, and when I'll show what Finn's little son can do you may then
judge of what my daddy himself is.""

Finn then took the stone, and then, slyly exchanging it for the curds,
he squeezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in a
little shower from his hand.

""I'll now go in,"" said he, ""to my cradle; for I scorn to lose my time
with anyone that's not able to eat my daddy's bread, or squeeze water
out of a stone. Bedad, you had better be off out of this before he comes
back, for if he catches you, it's in flummery he'd have you in two
minutes."""
a-legend-of-knockmany,14,"Far Rua, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself; his
knees knocked together with the terror of Finn's return, and he
accordingly hastened in to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her that,
from that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her
husband. ""I admit fairly that I'm not a match for him,"" said he, ""strong
as I am. Tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague, and that I
will make myself scarce in this part of the country while I live.""

Finn, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very
quietly, his heart in his mouth with delight that Far Rua was about to
take his departure without discovering the tricks that been played off
on him.

""It's well for you,"" said Oonagh, ""that he doesn't happen to be here,
for it's nothing but hawk's meat he'd make of you.""

""I know that,"" said Far Rua, ""divel a thing else he'd make of me; but,
before I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth they are that can
eat griddle-cakes like that?"" and he pointed to it as he spoke.

""With all the pleasure in life,"" says she; ""only as they're far back in
his head you must put your finger a good way in.""

Far Rua was surprised to find so powerful a set of grinders in one so
young; but he was still much more so on finding, when he took his hand
from Finn's mouth, that he had left the very finger upon which his whole
strength depended behind him. He gave one loud groan and fell down at
once with terror and weakness. This was all Finn wanted, who now knew
that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy.
He instantly started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes the great
Far Rua, that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all
his followers, was no more."
a-lost-paradise,1,"In the middle of a great forest there lived a long time ago a
charcoal-burner and his wife. They were both young and handsome and
strong. When they got married, they thought work would never fail
them. But bad times came, and they grew poorer and poorer. The
nights in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent.

Now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the
charcoal-burner's hut. As he passed the door, he heard a sound of
sobbing. Being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, thinking
that perhaps he might be able to give some help.

'Were there ever two people so unhappy!' said a woman's voice. 'Here we
are, ready to work like slaves the whole day long, and no work can we
get. And it is all because of the curiosity of old mother Eve! If she
had only been like me, who never want to know anything. We should all
have been as happy as kings to-day, with plenty to eat, and warm
clothes to wear. Why--' but at this point a loud knock interrupted her
lamentations."
a-lost-paradise,2,"'Who is there?' asked she.

'I!' replied somebody.

'And who is ""I""?'

'The king. Let me in.'

Full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the
door. As the king entered, he noticed that there was no furniture in
the room at all, not even a chair. He pretended to be in too great
a hurry to see anything around him, and only said 'You must not let me
disturb you. I have no time to stay, but you seemed to be in trouble.
Tell me; are you very unhappy?'

'Oh, my lord, we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days!'
answered she. 'Nothing remains for us but to die of hunger.'

'No, no, you shan't do that,' cried the king, 'or if you do, it will be
your own fault. You shall come with me into my palace. You will feel
as if you were in Paradise, I promise you. In return, I only ask one
thing of you, that you shall obey my orders exactly.'"
a-lost-paradise,3,"The charcoal-burner and his wife both stared at him for a moment, as
if they could hardly believe their ears. Indeed, it was not to be
wondered at! Then they found their tongues, and exclaimed together:

'Oh, yes, yes, my lord! we will do everything you tell us. How could we
be so ungrateful as to disobey you, when you are so kind?'

The king smiled, and his eyes twinkled.

'Well, let us start at once,' said he. 'Lock your door, and put the key
in your pocket.'

The woman looked as if she thought this was needless, seeing it was
quite, quite certain they would never come back. But she dared not say
so, and did as the king told her.

After walking through the forest for a couple of miles, they all
three reached the palace. By the king's orders, servants led the
charcoal-burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things
such as they had never even dreamed of. First, they bathed in green
marble baths where the water looked like the sea. Then, they put on
silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant. When they were ready, one
of the king's special servants entered, and took them into a small hall,
where dinner was laid. This pleased them better than anything else."
a-lost-paradise,4,"They were just about to sit down to the table when the king walked in.

'I hope you have been attended to properly,' said he, 'and that you will
enjoy your dinner. My steward will take care you have all you want.
I wish you to do exactly as you please. Oh, by the bye, there is one
thing! You notice that soup-tureen in the middle of the table? Well, be
careful on no account to lift the lid. If once you take off the cover,
there is an end of your good fortune.' Then, bowing to his guests, he
left the room.

'Did you hear what he said?' inquired the charcoal-burner in an
awe-stricken voice. 'We are to have what we want, and do what we please.
Only we must not touch the soup-tureen.'

'No, of course we won't,' answered the wife. 'Why should we wish to?
But all the same it is rather odd. One can't help wondering what is
inside.'"
a-lost-paradise,5,"For many days life went on like a beautiful dream to the
charcoal-burner and his wife. Their beds were so comfortable, they could
hardly make up their minds to get up, and their clothes were so lovely they
could scarcely bring themselves to take them off. Their dinners were so
good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating. Then outside
the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing
birds. If they desired to go further, a golden coach, painted with
wreaths of forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their
orders. Sometimes it happened that the king came to see them. He
smiled as he glanced at the man, who was getting rosier and plumper each
day. But when his eyes rested on the woman, they took on a look which
seemed to say 'I knew it,' though this neither the charcoal-burner nor
his wife ever noticed.

'Why are you so silent?' asked the man one morning when dinner had
passed before his wife had uttered one word. 'A little while ago you
used to be chattering all the day long. Now I have almost forgotten
the sound of your voice.'"
a-lost-paradise,6,"'Oh, nothing; I did not feel inclined to talk, that was all!' She
stopped, and added carelessly after a pause, 'Don't you ever wonder what
is in that soup-tureen?'

'No, never,' replied the man. 'It is no affair of ours,' and the
conversation dropped once more. As time went on, the woman spoke
less and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite
frightened about her. As to her food, she refused one thing after
another.

'My dear wife,' said the man at last, 'you really must eat something.
What in the world is the matter with you? If you go on like this you
will die.'

'I would rather die than not know what is in that tureen,' she burst
forth so violently that the husband was quite startled.

'Is that it?' cried he; 'are you making yourself miserable because of
that? Why, you know we should be turned out of the palace, and sent away
to starve.'

'Oh no, we shouldn't. The king is too good-natured. Of course he didn't
mean a little thing like this! Besides, there is no need to lift the lid
off altogether. Just raise one corner so that I may peep. We are quite
alone: nobody will ever know.'"
a-lost-paradise,7,"The man hesitated. It did seem a 'little thing.' If it was to make
his wife contented and happy it was well worth the risk. So he took
hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully,
while the woman stooped down to peep. Suddenly she startled back with a
scream. For a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and
had nearly hit her in the eye. Round and round the room it ran. Round
and round they both ran after it, knocking down chairs and vases in
their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen. In the
middle of all the noise the door opened. The mouse ran out between
the feet of the king. In one instant both the man and his wife were
hiding under the table. To all appearance the room was empty.

'You may as well come out,' said the king, 'and hear what I have to
say.'

'I know what it is,' answered the charcoal-burner, hanging his head. 'The
mouse has escaped.'

'A guard of soldiers will take you back to your hut,' said the king.
'Your wife has the key.'

'Weren't they silly?' cried the grandchildren of the charcoal-burners
when they heard the story. 'How we wish that we had had the chance! WE
should never have wanted to know what was in the soup-tureen!'"
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,1,"Long, long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki. Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her. Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends, he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed. This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal. He died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone. Fearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead. There in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters, a little boy was born to her. She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy. Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger. By the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters. Then his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters, who called him ""Wonder-child,"" and his mother the ""Old Nurse of the Mountains,"" for they did not know her high rank. Another favorite pastime of Kintaro's was to smash up rocks and stones. You can imagine how strong he was!"
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,2,"Quite unlike other boys, Kintaro, grew up all alone in the mountain wilds. As he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk. By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master, and he used them as his servants and messengers. But his special retainers were the bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,3,"The bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with. When she came to take them home Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave. He was very fond of the deer too, and would often put his arms round the creature's neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him. Great was the fun they all had together."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,4,"One day, as usual, Kintaro went up into the mountains, followed by the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare. After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads, they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,5,"Here, indeed, was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together. The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,6,"Kintaro said, ""Here is a place for a good game. What do you all say to a wrestling match?""

The bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others:

""That will be great fun,"" said she. ""I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers."" She set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.

""All right,"" said Kintaro, ""I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round.""

""What fun! we shall all try to get the prize,"" said the bear."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,7,"The deer, the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle. When this was finished, Kintaro cried out:

""Now begin! the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire. Now, Mr. Deer, you are to be umpire!""

""He, he!"" answered the deer. ""I will be umpire. Now, Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare, if you are both ready, please walk out and take your places on the platform.""

Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out, quickly and nimbly, to the wrestling platform. The deer, as umpire, stood between the two and called out:

""Red-back! Red-back!"" (this to the monkey, who has a red back in Japan). ""Are you ready?""

Then he turned to the hare:

""Long-ears! Long-ears! are you ready?""

Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal. When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other, crying ""Yoisho, yoisho!"""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,8,"While the monkey and the hare wrestled, the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and were in danger of falling over.

""Red-back! Red-back! stand your ground!"" called out the deer.

""Long-ears! Long-ears! be strong, be strong-don't let the monkey beat you!"" grunted the bear.

So the monkey and the hare, encouraged by their friends, tried their very hardest to beat each other. The hare at last gained on the monkey. The monkey seemed to trip up, and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,9,"The poor monkey sat up rubbing his back, and his face was very long as he screamed angrily. ""Oh, oh! how my back hurts-my back hurts me!""

Seeing the monkey in this plight on the ground, the deer holding his leaf on high said:

""This round is finished-the hare has won.""

Kintaro then opened his luncheon box and taking out a rice-dumpling, gave it to the hare saying:

""Here is your prize, and you have earned, it well!"""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,10,"Now the monkey got up looking very cross, and as they say in Japan ""his stomach stood up,"" for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten. So he said to Kintaro and the others who were standing by:

""I have not been fairly beaten. My foot slipped and I tumbled. Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round.""

Then Kintaro consenting, the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again. Now, as every one knows, the monkey is a cunning animal by nature, and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible. To do this, he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare's long ear. This he soon managed to do. The hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard. The monkey seizing his opportunity at last, caught hold of one of the hare's legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais. The monkey was now the victor and received, a rice-dumpling from Kintaro, which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,11,"The deer with long horns and the hare with long ears, it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match. Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees, and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten. In this way, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, conquering, the little party amused themselves till they were tired.

At last Kintaro got up and said:

""This is enough for to-day. What a nice place we have found for wrestling! Let us come again to-morrow. Now, we will all go home. Come along!"" So saying, Kintaro led the way while the animals followed.

After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley. Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing. Bridge there was none. The river rushed ""don, don"" on its way. All the animals looked serious, wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,12,"Kintaro, however, said:

""Wait a moment. I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes.""

The bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now.

Kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank. At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water's edge. He took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might, once, twice, thrice! At the third pull, so great was Kintaro's strength that the roots gave way, and ""meri, meri"" (crash, crash), over fell the tree, forming an excellent bridge across the stream."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,13,"""There,"" said Kintaro, ""what do you think of my bridge? It is quite safe, so follow me,"" and he stepped across first. The four animals followed. Never had they seen any one so strong before, and they all exclaimed:

""How strong he is! how strong he is!""

While all this was going on by the river a woodcutter, who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream, had seen all that passed beneath him. He watched with great surprise Kintaro and his animal companions. He rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,14,"The woodcutter, for such he seemed to be by his dress, marveled at all he saw, and said to himself:

""This is no ordinary child. Whose son can he be? I will find out before this day is done.""

He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. Kintaro knew nothing of all this, and little guessed that he was being followed. On reaching the other side of the river he and the animals separated, they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother, who was waiting for him."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,15,"As soon as he entered the cottage, which stood like a matchbox in the heart of the pine-woods, he went to greet his mother, saying:

""Okkasan (mother), here I am!""

""O, Kimbo!"" said his mother with a bright smile, glad to see her boy home safe after the long day. ""How late you are to-day. I feared that something had happened to you. Where have you been all the time?""

""I took my four friends, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, up into the hills. There I made them try a wrestling match, to see which was the strongest. We all enjoyed the sport, and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match.""

""Now tell me who is the strongest of all?"" asked his mother, pretending not to know."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,16,"""Oh, mother,"" said Kintaro, ""don't you know that I am the strongest? There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them.""

""But next to you then, who is the strongest?""

""The bear comes next to me in strength,"" answered Kintaro.

""And after the bear?"" asked his mother again.

""Next to the bear it is not easy to say which is the strongest, for the deer, the monkey, and the hare all seem to be as strong as each other,"" said Kintaro.

Suddenly Kintaro and his mother were startled by a voice from outside.

""Listen to me, little boy! Next time you go, take this old man with you to the wrestling match. He would like to join the sport too!"""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,17,"It was the old woodcutter who had followed Kintaro from the river. He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage. Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise. They looked at the intruder wonderingly and saw that he was some one they had never seen before.

""Who are you?"" they both exclaimed.

Then the woodcutter laughed and said:

""It does not matter who I am yet, but let us see who has the strongest arm-this boy or myself?""

Then Kintaro, who had lived all his life in the forest, answered the old man without any ceremony, saying:

""We will have a try if you wish it, but you must not be angry whoever is beaten."""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,18,"Then Kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other's hands. For a long time Kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way, each trying to bend the other's arm, but the old man was very strong, and the strange pair were evenly matched. At last the old man desisted, declaring it a drawn game.

""You are, indeed, a very strong child. There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm!"" said the woodcutter. ""I saw you first on the banks of the river a few hours ago, when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent. Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home. Your strength of arm, which I have just tried, proves what I saw this afternoon. When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan. It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains.""

Then he turned to Kintaro's mother:"
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,19,"""And you, mother, have you no thought of taking your child to the Capital, and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai (a Japanese knight)?""

""You are very kind to take so much interest in my son."" replied the mother; ""but he is as you see, wild and uneducated. I fear it would be very difficult to do as you say. Because of his great strength as an infant I hid him away in this unknown part of the country, for he hurt every one that came near him. I have often wished that I could, one day, see my boy a knight wearing two swords. But as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the Capital, I fear my hope will never come true."""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,20,"""You need not trouble yourself about that. To tell you the truth I am no woodcutter! I am one of the great generals of Japan. My name is Sadamitsu, and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no-Raiko. He ordered me to go round the country and look for boys who give promise of remarkable strength, so that they may be trained as soldiers for his army. I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter. By good fortune, I have thus unexpectedly come across your son. Now if you really wish him to be a samurai, I will take him and present him to the Lord Raiko as a candidate for his service. What do you say to this?""

As the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother's heart was filled with a great joy. She saw that here was a wonderful chance of the one wish of her life being fulfilled-that of seeing Kintaro a samurai before she died."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,21,"Bowing her head to the ground, she replied:

""I will then entrust my son to you if you really mean what you say.""

Kintaro had all this time been sitting by his mother's side listening to what they said. When his mother finished speaking, he exclaimed:

""Oh, joy! joy! I am to go with the general and one day I shall be a samurai!"""
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,22,"Thus Kintaro's fate was settled, and the general decided to start for the Capital at once, taking Kintaro with him. It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy, for he was all that was left to her. But she hid her grief with a strong face. She knew that it was for her boy's good that he should leave her now. She must not discourage him just as he was setting out. Kintaro promised never to forget her, and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age.

All the animals, those he had tamed to serve him, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, as soon as they found out that he was going away, came to ask if they might attend him as usual. When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,23,"""Kimbo,"" said his mother, ""mind and be a good boy.""

""Mr. Kintaro,"" said the faithful animals, ""we wish you good health on your travels.""

Then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him. From that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller, till he was lost to sight.

The general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as Kintaro.

Having arrived at their destination the general took Kintaro at once to his Lord, Minamoto-no-Raiko. He told him all about Kintaro and how he had found the child. Lord Raiko was delighted with the story, and having commanded Kintaro to be brought to him, made him one of his vassals at once."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,24,"Lord Raiko's army was famous for its band called ""The Four Braves."" These warriors were chosen by himself from amongst the bravest and strongest of his soldiers. The small and well-picked band was distinguished throughout the whole of Japan for the dauntless courage of its men.

When Kintaro grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four Braves. He was by far the strongest of them all. Soon after this event, news was brought to the city that a cannibal monster had taken up his abode not far away and that people were stricken with fear. Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue. He immediately started off, delighted at the prospect of trying his sword."
adventures-of-kintaro-golden-boy,25,"Surprising the monster in its den, he made short work of cutting off its great head, which he carried back in triumph to his master.

Kintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country, and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him. He now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother, who lived happily with him in the Capital to the end of her days.

Is not this the story of a great hero?"
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,1,"The story takes place in Baghdad during the Abbasid era. Ali Baba and his elder brother Cassim are the sons of a merchant. After the death of their father, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, building on their father's business - but Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,2,"One day Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, and he happens to overhear a group of forty thieves visiting their treasure store. The treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by magic. It opens on the words ""Open, Simsim"", and seals itself on the words ""Close, Simsim"". When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself, and takes some of the treasure home."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,3,"Ali Baba borrows his sister-in-law's scales to weigh this new wealth of gold coins. Unbeknownst to Ali, she puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband, Ali Baba's rich and greedy brother, Cassim. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave and enters with the magic words, but in his greed and excitement over the treasures forgets the magic words to get back out again. The thieves find him there, and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body, quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the entrance of the cave to discourage any similar attempts in the future."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,4,"Ali Baba brings the body home, where he entrusts Morgiana, a clever slave-girl in Cassim's household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim's house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassims' body back together, so that no one will be suspicious. Ali and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone asking awkward questions."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,5,"The thieves, finding the body gone, realize that yet another person must know their secret, and set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn a dead man's body back together. Realizing that the dead man must have been the thieves' victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. The thief marks the door with a symbol. The plan is for the other thieves to come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana and she, loyal to her master, foils his plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood with a similar marking."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,6,"When the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house and the head thief kills the lesser thief. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again, only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba's front door. Again Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps. The second thief is killed for his stupidity as well. At last, the head thief goes and looks for himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba's house."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,7,"The chief of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba's hospitality, bringing with him Forty thieves hiding in oil jarsmules loaded with thirty-eight oil jars, one filled with oil, the other thirty-seven hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan, killing the thirty-seven thieves in their oil jars by pouring boiling oil on them. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers that they are dead, and escapes."
ali-baba-and-forty-thieves,8,"To exact revenge, after some time the thief establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba's son (who is now in charge of the late Cassim's business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house. The thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the heart of the thief when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief tried to kill him, he gives Morgiana her freedom and marries her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it. Thus, the story ends happily for everyone except the forty thieves and Cassim."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,1,"ONCE upon a time there was a king who had seven sons. He was so fond of them that he never could bear to have them all away from him at once. One of them always had to stay with him. When they had grown up, six of them were to go forth and look for wives. The youngest the king wanted to keep at home, and the others were to bring along a bride for him. The king gave the six the handsomest clothes that had ever been seen, clothes that glittered from afar. Each received a horse that had cost many hundred dollars, and so they set forth. And after they had been at the courts of many kings, and had seen many princesses, they at last came to a king who had six daughters. Such beautiful princesses they had not as yet met with. Each of them paid court to one of them, and when each had won his sweetheart, they rode back home again. But they were so deeply in love with their brides that they altogether forgot they were also to bring back a princess for their young brother who had stayed at home."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,2,"Now when they had already covered a good bit of the homeward road, they passed close to a steep cliff-side where the giants dwelt. And a giant came out, looked at them, and turned them all to stone, princes and princesses. The king waited and waited for his six sons. Though he waited and yearned, they did not come. Then he grew very sad, and said that he would never really be happy again. ""If I did not have you,"" he told his youngest, ""I would not keep on living, so sad am I at having lost your brothers."" ""But I had already been thinking of asking your permission to set out and find my brothers again,"" said the youngest. ""No, that I will not allow under any circumstances,"" answered the father, ""otherwise you will be lost to me into the bargain."" But the youth's mind was set on going, and he pleaded so long that finally the king had to let him have his way. Now the king had only a wretched old nag for him, since the six other princes and their suite had been given all the good horses. That did not worry the youngest. He mounted the shabby old nag, and ""Farewell, father!"" he said to the king. ""I will surely return, and perhaps I will bring my six brothers back with me."" And with that he rode off."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,3,"Now when he had ridden a while he met a raven. He was lying in the road beating his wings, and unable to move from the spot because he was so starved. ""O, dear friend, if you will give me a bite to eat, then I'll help you in your hour of direst need!"" cried the raven. ""I have not much food, nor are you likely to be able to help me much,"" said the king's son, ""but still I can give you a little, for it is easy to see you need it."" And with that he gave the raven some of the provisions he had with him. And when he had ridden a while longer, he came to a brook. There lay a great salmon who had gotten on dry land, and was threshing about, and could not get back into the water. ""O, dear friend, help me back into the water,"" said the salmon to the king's son, ""and I will help you, too, in your hour of greatest need!"" ""The help you will be able to give me will probably not amount to much,"" said the prince, ""but it would be a pity if you had to lie there and pine away."" And with that he pushed the fish back into the water. Then he rode on a long, long way, and met a wolf. The wolf was so starved that he lay in the middle of the road, and writhed with hunger."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,4,"""Dear friend, let me eat your horse,"" said the wolf. ""My hunger is so great that my very inwards rattle, because I have had nothing to eat for the past two years!"" ""No,"" said the prince, ""I cannot do that: first I met a raven, and had to give him my provisions; then I met a salmon and had to help him back into the water; and now you want my horse. That will not do, for what shall I ride on then?"" ""Well, my dear friend, you must help me,"" was the wolf's reply. ""You can ride on me. I will help you in turn in your hour of greatest need."" ""The help you might give me would probably not amount to much; but I will let you eat the horse, since you are in such sorry case,"" returned the prince. And when the wolf had eaten the horse, the prince took the bit and put it in the wolf's mouth, and fastened the saddle on his back. His meal had made the wolf so strong that he trotted off with the king's son as fast as he could. He had never ridden so swiftly before. ""When we have gone a little further I will show you the place where the giants live,"" said the wolf. In a short time they were there. ""Well, this is where the giants live,"" said the wolf. ""There you see your six brothers, whom the giant turned into stone, and yonder are their six brides. Up there is the door through which you must pass."" ""No, I would not dare do that,"" said the king's son. ""He would murder me."" ""O no,"" was the wolf's reply, ""when you go in you will find a princess, and she will tell you how to set about getting rid of the giant. You need only do as she says."" And the prince went in, though he was afraid. When he entered the house the giant was not there. In one of the rooms sat a princess, just as the wolf had said, and such a beautiful maiden the youth had never seen. ""Now may God help you, how did you get in here?"" cried the princess, when she saw him. ""It is certain death for you. No one can kill the giant who lives here, for he hasn't his heart about him."""
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,5,"""Well, since I do happen to be here, I will at least make the attempt,"" said the prince. ""And I want to try to deliver my brothers, who stand outside, turned to stone, and I would like to save you as well."" ""Well, if you insist upon it, we must see what we can do,"" replied the princess. ""Now you must crawl under the bed here, and must listen carefully when I talk to the giant. But you must not make a sound."" The prince slipped under the bed, and no sooner was he there than the giant came home. ""Hu, it smells like the flesh of a Christian here!"" he cried. ""Yes,"" said the princess, ""a jackdaw flew by with a human bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I threw it out again at once, but the odor does not disappear so quickly."" Then the giant said no more about it. Toward evening he went to bed, but after he had lain there a while, the princess, who sat looking out of the window, said: ""There is something I would have asked you about long ago, if only I had dared."" ""And what may that be?"" inquired the giant. ""I would like to know where you keep your heart, since you do not have it about you?"" said the princess. ""O, that is something you need not ask about; at any rate, it lies under the threshold of the door,"" was the giant's reply. ""Aha,"" thought the prince under the bed, ""that is where we will find it!"""
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,6,"The next morning the giant got up very early, and went into the forest. No sooner had he gone than the prince and the king's daughter set about looking for the heart under the threshold of the door. Yet no matter how much they dug and searched they found nothing. ""This time he has fooled us,"" said the princess. ""We'll have to try again."" And she picked the loveliest flowers she could find and strewed them over the threshold which they had put to rights again and when the time drew near for the giant's return, the king's son crept under the bed once more. When he was beneath it, the giant came. ""Hu hu, I smell human flesh!"" he cried. ""Yes,"" said the princess. ""A jackdaw flew by with a human bone in her beak, and she let it fall down the chimney. I threw it out at once, but I suppose one can still smell it."" Then the giant held his tongue, and said no more about it. After a time he asked who had strewn the flowers over the threshold. ""O, I did that,"" said the princess. ""What does it mean?"" the giant then asked. ""O, I am so fond of you that I had to do it, because I know that is where your heart lies."" ""Yes, of course,"" said the giant, ""but it does not happen to lie there at all."""
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,7,"When he had gone to bed, the princess sat looking out of the window. She again asked the giant where he kept his heart, for she was so fond of him, said she, that she wanted to know above all things. ""O, it is in the wardrobe there by the wall,"" said the giant. ""Aha,"" thought the king's son under the bed, ""that is where we will find it!"""
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,8,"The next morning the giant got up early, and went into the forest. No sooner had he gone than the prince and the king's daughter set about looking for his heart in the wardrobe. Yet no matter how much they looked, they did not find it. ""Well, well,"" said the princess, ""we will have to try once more."" Then she adorned the wardrobe with flowers and wreaths, and toward evening the king's youngest son again crawled under the bed. Then the giant came: ""Hu hu, it smells of human flesh here!"" he cried. ""Yes,"" said the princess. ""A jackdaw just this moment flew by with a human bone in her beak, and she let it fall down the chimney. I threw it out again at once, but it may be that you can still smell it."" When the giant heard this, he had nothing further to say about it. But not long afterward he noticed that the wardrobe was adorned with flowers and wreaths, and asked who had done it. ""I,"" said the princess. ""What do you mean by such tomfoolery?"" asked the giant. ""O, I am so fond of you that I had to do it, since I know that is where your heart lies,"" was the reply of the princess. ""Are you really so stupid as to believe that?"" cried the giant. ""Yes, surely, I must believe it,"" said the princess, ""when you tell me so."" ""How silly you are,"" said the giant, ""you could never reach the place where I keep my heart."" ""But still I would like to know where it is,"" answered the princess. Then the giant could no longer resist, and at last had to tell her the truth. ""Far, far away, in a lake there lies an island,"" said he, ""and on the island stands a church, and in the church there is a well, and in the well floats a duck, and in the duck there is an egg, and in the egg it is my heart!"""
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,9,"The next morning, before dawn, the giant went to the forest again. ""Well, now I must get under way,"" said the prince, ""and it is a way I wish I could find."" So he said farewell to the princess for the time being, and when he stepped out of the door, the wolf was standing there waiting for him. He told him what had happened at the giant's, and said that now he would go to the well in the church, if only he knew the way. The wolf told him to climb on his back. He would manage to find the way, said he. And then they were off as though they had wings, over rock and wood, over hill and dale. After they had been underway for many, many days, they at last reached the lake. Then the king's son did not know how they were to get across. But the wolf told him not to worry, and swam across with the prince to the island. Then they came to the church. But the church-key hung high up in the tower, and at first the king's son did not at all know how they were to get it down."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,10,"""You must call the raven,"" said the wolf, and that is what the king's son did. And the raven came at once, and flew right down with the key, and now the prince could enter the church. Then, when he came to the well, there was the duck, sure enough, swimming about as the giant had said. He stood by the well and called the duck, and at last he lured her near him, and seized her. But at the moment he grasped her and lifted her out of the water, she let the egg fall into the well. Now the prince again did not know how he was to get hold of it. ""Well, you must call the salmon,"" said the wolf. That is what the king's son did, and the salmon came at once, and brought up the egg from the bottom of the well. Then the wolf told him to squeeze the egg a little. And when the prince squeezed, the giant cried out. ""squeeze it again!"" said the wolf, and when the prince did so, the giant cried out far more dolefully, and fearfully and tearfully begged for his life. He would do all the king's son asked him to, said he, if only he would not squeeze his heart in two. ""Tell him to give back their original form to your six brothers, whom he turned to stone, and to their brides, as well; and that then you will spare his life,"" said the wolf, and the prince did so. The troll at once agreed, and changed the six brothers into princes, and their brides into kings' daughters. ""Now squash the egg!"" cried the wolf. Then the prince squeezed the egg in two, and the giant burst into pieces."
anent-giant-who-did-not-have-his-heart-about-him,11,"When the king's youngest son had put an end to the giant in this way, he rode back on his wolf to the giant's home. There stood his six brothers as much alive as ever they had been, together with, their brides. Then the prince went into the hill to get his own bride, and they all rode home together. And great was the joy of the old king when his seven sons all returned, each with his bride. ""But the bride of my youngest is the most beautiful, after all, and he shall sit with her at the head of the table!"" said the king. And then they had a feast that lasted for weeks, and if they have not stopped, they are feasting to this very day."
aspenclog,1,"ASPENCLOG's mother was an aspen-tree. He slew the man who had chopped her down. Then he went to the king and asked whether he could give him work. He wanted no other pay than the right to give the king three good thumps on the back when there was no more work for him to do. The king agreed to this condition, for he thought he would always have enough work for him to do. Then he sent him to the forest to gather wood. But Aspenclog piled up such a tremendous load that two horses could not pull the wagon. So he took two polar bears, harnessed them to the wagon, drove it home, and left the bears in the stable, where they ate up all the king's cattle."
aspenclog,2,"Then he was told to keep a mill grinding which the evil one often brought to a stop. No sooner had Aspenclog commenced to grind than, sure enough, the mill stopped. Aspenclog took a candle and made a search. No doubt of it, the evil one had wedged his leg between the mill-stones. No sooner had Aspenclog seen the leg, than he chopped it off with his club. Then the evil one came hobbling up on one leg, and begged fearfully and tearfully for the leg he had lost. No, he could not have it, said the youth, unless he gave him a bushel of money for it. But when the evil one had to pay Aspenclog the money, he thought to cheat him, and said that they would wager bushel against bushel, as to which of them could throw the highest. They argued a while about which was to throw first. At last Aspenclog had to begin. Now the evil one had a ball with which they were to throw. Aspenclog stood a long time looking at the moon. ""Why do you do that?"" asked the evil one. ""Well, I would like to see whether I cannot throw the ball into the moon,"" said Aspenclog. ""Do you see those black spots? Those are the balls I have already thrown up into the moon."" Then the evil one was afraid of losing his ball, and he did not dare to let Aspenclog throw."
aspenclog,3,"So they wagered bushel against bushel as to which one of them could blow the highest note. ""You may blow first,"" said Aspenclog. ""No, you!"" Finally it was decided that Aspenclog should blow first. Then he went to a hill, took an enormous fir-tree and wound it around his horn like a reed. ""Why do you do that?"" asked the evil one. ""Well, if I don't, the horn will burst when I blow it,"" was Aspenclog's answer. Now the evil one began to get frightened, and Aspenclog came home with half a ton of money."
aspenclog,4,"But soon the king had no corn left to grind. And war broke out in the land. ""Now he will have work enough to last him a lifetime,"" thought the king. And he told Aspenclog to go out against the enemy. Aspenclog was quite ready to do so; but wanted to have plenty of provisions to take with him. Then he set forth, and when he saw the enemy he sat down to eat. The enemy shot at him as hard as they could, but their bullets did not touch him. When Aspenclog had satisfied his hunger, he stood up, tore out an enormous oak by the roots, and lay about him with it. Before very long he had hewn down all of the enemy. Then he went back home to the king."
aspenclog,5,"""Have you any more work for me?"" he asked. ""No, now I have no work left,"" said the king. ""Then I will give you three good thumps on the back,"" said Aspenclog. The king begged permission to bolster himself up with pillows. ""Yes, take as many as you want,"" said Aspenclog. Then he thumped, and at his first thump the king burst into pieces."
black-sheep,1,"It was a bright spring day, and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures, where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious.
The sheep had had a strange experience that morning, for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them, and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy, soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears."
black-sheep,2,"The sheep did not like this very well, for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them; and when they were sheared they felt very strange, for it was almost as if someone took off all your clothes and let you run around naked. None of them were in a very good temper this morning, although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet, and as they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags, the old ram said, crossly,

""I hope they are satisfied, now that they have stolen from us all our soft, warm fleece.""

""What are they going to do with it?"" asked one of the sheep."
black-sheep,3,"""Oh, they will spin it into threads and make coats for the men and dresses for the women. For men are such strange creatures that no wool grows on them at all, and that is why they selfishly rob us of our fleece that they may cover their own skinny bodies!""

""It must be horrid to be a man,"" said the Black Sheep, ""and not to have any wool grow on you at all. I'm sorry for that little boy that lives in the lane, for he will never be able to keep warm unless we give him some of our wool.""

""But what a shame it is,"" continued the ram, ""for the farmer to steal all the wool from us when we have taken all the trouble to grow it!"""
black-sheep,4,"""I don't mind,"" bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass; ""it's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha'n't have to carry it around wherever I go.""

""Oh, indeed!"" sneered the ram, ""you like it, do you? Have you any idea what you look like, all sheared down to your skin? How would you like to have someone come along and see you, now that you are all head and legs?"""
black-sheep,5,"""Oh, I wouldn't mind,"" said the lamb again; ""I shall grow more wool by winter-time, and I'm sure I don't look any worse than you do.""

Some of the sheep looked at the ram and began to giggle, for he was old and thin, and looked very comical indeed without any wool. And this made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass, and would not speak to the others at all.

""I don't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut,"" remarked the Black Sheep, thoughtfully, ""for the farmer is very kind to us, and so is his dame, and I am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter. For before the snow comes our wool will grow out again, and we shall not be any the worse for our loss."""
black-sheep,6,"""What do those people who haven't any sheep do for clothes?"" asked the lamb.

""I'm sure I don't know. They must nearly freeze in the winter. Perhaps the ram can tell us.""

But the ram was still angry, and refused to say anything, so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture and eat the tender, new grass.

By and by the Black Sheep wandered near the lane, and looking up, saw the little boy watching it through the bars.

""Good morning, Black Sheep,"" said the boy; ""why do you look so funny this morning?""

""They have cut off my wool,"" answered the sheep."
black-sheep,7,"""What will they do with it, Black Sheep?"" enquired the little boy.

""They will make coats of it, to keep themselves warm.""

""I wish I had some wool,"" said the boy, ""for I need a new coat very badly, and mamma is so poor she cannot buy me one.""

""That is too bad,"" replied the Black Sheep; ""but I shall have more wool by and by, and then I will give you a bagful to make a new coat from.""

""Will you really?"" asked the boy, looking very much pleased."
black-sheep,8,"""Indeed I will,"" answered the sheep, ""for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me. So you watch until my wool grows again, and then you shall have your share of it.""

""Oh, thank you!"" said the boy, and he ran away to tell his mother what the Black Sheep had said.

When the farmer came into the field again the Black Sheep said to him,

""Master, how many bags of wool did you cut from my back?""

""Two bags full,"" replied the farmer; ""and it was very nice wool indeed.""

""If I grow three bags full the next time, may I have one bag for myself?"" asked the sheep."
black-sheep,9,"""Why, what could you do with a bag of wool?"" questioned the farmer.


""I want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane. He is very poor and needs a new coat.""

""Very well,"" answered the master; ""if you can grow three bags full I will give one to the little boy.""

So the Black Sheep began to grow wool, and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock. She always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures, and drank from the clearest part of the brook, and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep-sorrel. And each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing."
black-sheep,10,"""I am getting along finely,"" the Black Sheep would answer, ""for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as I have grown already.""

""Can I do anything to help you?"" asked the little boy.

""Not that I think of,"" replied the sheep, ""unless you could get me a little salt. I believe salt helps the wool to grow.""

So the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt, and then he came back to the bars, where the Black Sheep licked it out of his hand.

Day by day the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer, and even the old ram noticed it and said,

""You are foolish to grow so much wool, for the farmer will cut it all off, and it will do you no good. Now I am growing just as little as possible, for since he steals what I have I am determined he shall get very little wool from my back."""
black-sheep,11,"Black Sheep did not reply to this, for she thought the old ram very ill-tempered and selfish, and believed he was doing wrong not to grow more wool.

Finally the time came to shear the sheep again, and the farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them, and were surprised to see what a fine, big fleece the Black Sheep had grown.

""There will be three bagsful at the least,"" said the master, ""and I will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane. But, my goodness! how scraggly and poor the old ram looks. There is scarcely any wool on him at all. I think I must sell him to the butcher!"""
black-sheep,12,"And, in truth, although the ram kicked and struggled and bleated with rage, they tied his legs and put him into the cart and carried him away to the butcher. And that was the last the sheep ever saw of him.

But the Black Sheep ran up to the bars by the lane and waited with a glad heart till the little boy came. When he saw the sheep waiting for him he asked,

""Black Sheep, Black Sheep, have you any wool?""
And the sheep replied,

""Yes my little master, three bags full!"""
black-sheep,13,"""That is fine!"" said the boy; ""but who are the three bags for?""

""One for my master, one for his dame,
And one for the little boy that lives in the lane.""
""Thank you, Black Sheep,"" said the little boy; ""you are very kind, and I shall always think of you when I wear my new coat.""

The next day the sheep were all sheared, and the Black Sheep's fleece made three big bagsful. The farmer kept his promise and carried one bag to the little boy that lived in the lane, and the wool was so soft and so heavy that there was enough not only for the new coat, but to make his mother a warm dress as well."
black-sheep,14,"The Black Sheep was very proud and happy when the mother and her little boy came down to the bars and showed the new clothes that had been made from the wool.

""This pays me for all my trouble,"" said the Black Sheep, and the little boy reached his hand through the bars and patted her gently upon the head."
bokwewa-the-humpback,1,"Bokwewa and his brother lived in a far-off part of the country. By such
as had knowledge of them, Bokwewa, the elder, although deformed and
feeble of person, was considered a manito, who had assumed the mortal
shape; while his younger brother, Kwasynd, manly in appearance, active,
and strong, partook of the nature of the present race of beings.

They lived off the path, in a wild, lonesome place, far retired from
neighbors, and, undisturbed by cares, they passed their time, content
and happy. The days glided by serenely as the river that flowed by their
lodge."
bokwewa-the-humpback,2,"Owing to his lack of strength, Bokwewa never engaged in the chase, but
gave his attention entirely to the affairs of the lodge. In the long
winter evenings he passed the time in telling his brother stories of the
giants, spirits, weendigoes, and fairies of the elder age, when they had
the exclusive charge of the world. He also at times taught his brother
the manner in which game should be pursued, pointed out to him the ways
of the different beasts and birds of the chase, and assigned the seasons
at which they could be hunted with most success."
bokwewa-the-humpback,3,"For a while the brother was eager to learn, and keenly attended to his
duties as the provider of the lodge; but at length he grew weary of
their tranquil life, and began to have a desire to show himself among
men. He became restive in their retirement, and was seized with a
longing to visit remote places.

One day, Kwasynd told his brother that he should leave him; that he
wished to visit the habitations of men, and to procure a wife.

Bokwewa objected; but his brother overruled all that he said, and in
spite of every remonstrance, he departed on his travels."
bokwewa-the-humpback,4,"He traveled for a long time. At length he fell in with the footsteps of
men. They were moving by encampments, for he saw, at several spots, the
poles where they had passed. It was winter; and coming to a place where
one of their company had died, he found upon a scaffold, lying at length
in the cold blue air, the body of a beautiful young woman. ""She shall be
my wife!"" exclaimed Kwasynd.

He lifted her up, and bearing her in his arms, he returned to his
brother. ""Brother,"" he said, ""can not you restore her to life? Oh, do me
that favor!""

He looked upon the beautiful female with a longing gaze; but she lay as
cold and silent as when he had found her upon the scaffold.

""I will try,"" said Bokwewa."
bokwewa-the-humpback,5,"These words had been scarcely breathed, when the young woman rose up,
opened her eyes, and looked upon Bokwewa with a smile, as if she had
known him before.

To Kwasynd she paid no heed whatever; but presently Bokwewa, seeing how
she lingered in her gaze upon himself, said to her, ""Sister, that is
your husband,"" pointing to Kwasynd.

She listened to his voice, and crossing the lodge, she sat by Kwasynd,
and they were man and wife."
bokwewa-the-humpback,6,"For a long time they all lived contentedly together. Bokwewa was very
kind to his brother, and sought to render his days happy. He was ever
within the lodge, seeking to have it in readiness against the return of
Kwasynd from the hunt. And by following his directions, which were those
of one deeply skilled in the chase, Kwasynd always succeeded in
returning with a good store of meat.

But the charge of the two brothers was greatly lightened by the presence
of the spirit-wife; for without labor of the hand, she ordered the
lodge, and as she willed, every thing took its place, and was at once in
proper array. The wish of her heart seemed to control whatever she
looked upon, and it obeyed her desire."
bokwewa-the-humpback,7,"But it was still more to the surprise of her husband Kwasynd that she
never partook of food, nor shared in any way the longings and appetites
of a mortal creature. She had never been seen arranging her hair, like
other females, or at work upon her garments, and yet they were ever
seemly, and without blemish or disorder.

Behold her at any hour, she was ever beautiful, and she seemed to need
no ornament, nor nourishment, nor other aid, to give grace or strength
to her looks.

Kwasynd, when the first wonder of her ways had passed, payed little heed
to her discourse; he was engrossed with the hunt, and chose rather to be
abroad, pursuing the wild game, or in the lodge, enjoying its savory
spoil, than the society of his spirit-wife."
bokwewa-the-humpback,8,"But Bokwewa watched closely every word that fell from her lips, and
often forgot, like her, all mortal appetite and care of the body, in
conferring with her, and noting what she had to say of spirits and
fairies, of stars, and streams that never ceased to flow, and the
delight of the happy hunting-grounds, and the groves of the blessed.

One day Kwasynd had gone out as usual, and Bokwewa was sitting in the
lodge, on the opposite side to his brother's wife, when she suddenly
exclaimed:

""I must leave you,"" as a tall young man, whose face was like the sun in
its brightness, entered, and taking her by the hand he led her to the
door."
bokwewa-the-humpback,9,"She made no resistance, but turning as she left the lodge, she cast upon
Bokwewa a smile of kind regard, and was at once, with her companion,
gone from his view.

He ran to the door and glanced about. He saw nothing; but looking far
off in the sky, he thought that he could discover, at a great distance,
a shining track, and the dim figures of two who were vanishing in
heaven.

When his brother returned, Bokwewa related all to him exactly as it had
happened.

The face of Kwasynd changed, and was dark as the night. For several days
he would not taste food. Sometimes he would fall to weeping for a long
time, and now only it seemed that he remembered how gentle and beautiful
had been the ways of her who was lost. At last he said that he would go
in search of her."
bokwewa-the-humpback,10,"Bokwewa tried to dissuade him from it; but he would not be turned aside
from his purpose.

""Since you are resolved,"" said Bokwewa, ""listen to my advice. You will
have to go South. It is a long distance to the present abiding-place of
your wife, and there are so many charms and temptations by the way that
I fear you will be led astray and forget your errand. For the people
whom you will see in the country through which you have to pass, do
nothing but amuse themselves. They are very idle, gay and effeminate,
and I fear that they will lead you astray. Your path is beset with
dangers. I will mention one or two things which you must be on your
guard against."
bokwewa-the-humpback,11,"""In the course of your journey you will come to a large grape-vine lying
across your path. You must not even taste its fruit, for it is
poisonous. Step over it. It is a snake. You will next come to something
that looks like bear's fat, of which you are so fond. Touch it not, or
you will be overcome by the soft habits of the idle people. It is frog's
eggs. These are snares laid by the way for you.""

Kwasynd promised that he would observe the advice and bidding his
brother farewell, he set out. After traveling a long time he came to the
enchanted grape-vine. It looked so tempting, with its swelling purple
clusters, that he forgot his brother's warning, and tasted the fruit. He
went on till he came to the frog's eggs. They so much resembled
delicious bear's fat that Kwasynd tasted them. He still went on."
bokwewa-the-humpback,12,"At length he came to a wide plain. As he emerged from the forest the sun
was falling in the west, and it cast its scarlet and golden shades far
over the country. The air was perfectly calm, and the whole prospect had
the air of an enchanted land. Fruits and flowers, and delicate
blossoms, lured the eye and delighted the senses.

At a distance he beheld a large village, swarming with people, and as he
drew near he discovered women beating corn in silver mortars.

When they saw Kwasynd approaching, they cried out:

""Bokwewa's brother has come to see us.""

Throngs of men and women, in bright apparel, hurried out to meet him."
bokwewa-the-humpback,13,"He was soon, having already yielded to temptation by the way, overcome
by their fair looks and soft speeches, and he was not long afterward
seen beating corn with the women, having entirely abandoned all further
quest for his lost wife.

Meantime, Bokwewa, alone in the lodge, often musing upon the discourse
of the spirit-wife, who was gone, waited patiently his brother's return.
After the lapse of several years, when no tidings could be had, he set
out in search of him, and he arrived in safety among the soft and idle
people of the South. He met the same allurements by the way, and they
gathered around him on his coming as they had around his brother
Kwasynd; but Bokwewa was proof against their flattery. He only grieved
in his heart that any should yield."
bokwewa-the-humpback,14,"He shed tears of pity to see that his brother had laid aside the arms of
a hunter, and that he was beating corn with the women, indifferent to
the fate and the fortune of his lost wife.

Bokwewa ascertained that his brother's wife had passed on to a country
beyond.

After deliberating for a time, and spending several days in a severe
fast, he set out in the direction where he saw that a light shone from
the sky.

It was far off, but Bokwewa had a stout heart; and strong in the faith
that he was now on the broad path toward the happy land, he pressed
forward. For many days he traveled without encountering any thing
unusual."
bokwewa-the-humpback,15,"And now plains of vast extent, and rich in waving grass, began
to pass before his eyes. He saw many beautiful groves, and heard the
songs of countless birds.

At length he began to fail in strength for lack of food; when he
suddenly reached a high ground. From this he caught the first glimpse of
the other land. But it appeared to be still far off, and all the country
between, partly vailed in silvery mists, glittered with lakes and
streams of water. As he pressed on, Bokwewa came in sight of innumerable
herds of stately deer, moose, and other animals which walked near his
path, and they appeared to have no fear of man."
bokwewa-the-humpback,16,"And now again as he wound about in his course, and faced the north once
more, he beheld, coming toward him, an immense number of men, women,
and children, pressing forward in the direction of the shining land.

In this vast throng Bokwewa beheld persons of every age, from the little
infant, the sweet and lovely penaisee, or younger son, to the feeble,
gray old man, stooping under the burden of his years.

All whom Bokwewa met, of every name and degree, were heavily laden with
pipes, weapons, bows, arrows, kettles and other wares and implements.

One man stopped him, and complained of the weary load he was carrying.
Another offered him a kettle; another his bow and arrows; but he
declined all, and, free of foot, hastened on."
bokwewa-the-humpback,17,"And now he met women who were carrying their basket-work, and painted
paddles, and little boys, with their embellished war-clubs and bows and
arrows, the gift of their friends.

With this mighty throng, Bokwewa was borne along for two days and
nights, when he arrived at a country so still and shining, and so
beautiful in its woods and groves and plains, that he knew it was here
that he should find the lost spirit-wife.

He had scarcely entered this fair country, with a sense of home and the
return to things familiar strong upon him, when there appeared before
him the lost spirit-wife herself, who, taking him by the hand, gave him
welcome, saying, ""My brother, I am glad to see you. Welcome! welcome!
You are now in your native land!"""
brave-tin-soldier,1,"There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, ""Tin soldiers!"" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable."
brave-tin-soldier,2,"The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face."
brave-tin-soldier,3,"The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. ""That is the wife for me,"" he thought; ""but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her. Still I must try and make her acquaintance."" Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance."
brave-tin-soldier,4,"When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle."
brave-tin-soldier,5,"""Tin soldier,"" said the goblin, ""don't wish for what does not belong to you."" But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. ""Very well; wait till to-morrow, then,"" said the goblin. When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, ""Here I am,"" it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform."
brave-tin-soldier,6,"Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, ""Look, there is a tin soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in."" So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket. Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box."
brave-tin-soldier,7,"""Where am I going now?"" thought he. ""This is the black goblin's fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness."" Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. ""Have you a passport?"" asked the rat, ""give it to me at once."" But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, ""Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."" But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man."
brave-tin-soldier,8,"At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears--""Farewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave."""
brave-tin-soldier,9,"Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish. Oh how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket."
brave-tin-soldier,10,"The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, ""I declare here is the tin soldier."" The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and--how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself."
brave-tin-soldier,11,"It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at her and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder."
brave-tin-soldier,12,"Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder."
brother-sister,1,"THE brother took his sister's hand and said to her, 
""Since our mother died we have had no good days; our stepmother beats us every day, and if we go near her she kicks us away; we have nothing to eat but hard crusts of bread left over; the dog under the table fares better; he gets a good piece every now and then. If our mother only knew, how she would pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide world!"" 
So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places, and if it rained the sister said, 
""The skies and we are weeping together."" 
In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so weary with hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a high tree and fell asleep."
brother-sister,2,"The next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone brightly through the leaves. Then said the brother, 
""Sister, I am thirsty; if I only knew where to find a brook, that I might go and drink! I almost think that I hear one rushing."" So the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest. So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles, the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said in its rushing, 
    ""He a tiger will be who drinks of me,     Who drinks of me a tiger will be!"" 
Then the sister cried, 
""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and will tear me in pieces."""
brother-sister,3,"So the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. When they came to a second brook the sister heard it say, 
    ""He a wolf will be who drinks of me,     Who drinks of me a wolf will be!"" 
Then the sister cried, 
""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!"" 
So the brother refrained from drinking, and said, 
""I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; my thirst is so great."" 
And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said, 
    ""Who drinks of me a fawn will be,     He a fawn will be who drinks of me!"" 
Then the sister said, 
""O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and run away far from me."" 
But he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a fawn."
brother-sister,4,"And the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also, and stayed sadly beside her. At last the maiden said, 
""Be comforted, dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you."" 
Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck, and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; and then she led him on, and they went deeper into the forest. And when they had gone a long long way, they came at last to a little house, and the maiden looked inside, and as it was empty she thought, 
""We might as well live here."""
brother-sister,5,"And she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy, frolicking round her. At night, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life. So they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. 
Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them. 
""Oh,"" said he to his sister, ""do let me go to the hunt; I cannot stay behind any longer,"" and begged so long that at last she consented."
brother-sister,6,"""But mind,"" said she to him, ""come back to me at night. I must lock my door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you must knock and say, 'Little sister, let me in,' and unless I hear that I shall not unlock the door."" 
Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. The King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared. As soon as it was dark he went back to the little house, knocked at the door, and said, 
""Little sister, let me in."""
brother-sister,7,"Then the door was opened to him, and he went in, and rested the whole night long on his soft bed. The next morning the hunt began anew, and when the fawn heard the hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer, and said, 
""Little sister, let me out, I must go."" The sister opened the door and said, 
""Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words."" 
When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. This lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard how he called out, ""Little sister, let me in,"" and saw the door open and shut again after him directly. The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the King, 
""To-morrow we will hunt again."""
brother-sister,8,"But the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was wounded. She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said, ""Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well."" The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said, 
""I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily again!"" The sister began to weep, and said, 
""I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. I cannot let you go!"" 
""Then I shall die here with longing,"" answered the fawn; ""when I hear the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin."" 
Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and merry. When the King saw him, he said to his hunters, 
""Now, follow him up all day long till the night comes, and see that you do him no hurt."""
brother-sister,9,"So as soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen: ""Now, come and show me the little house in the wood."" 
And when he got to the door he knocked at it, and cried, 
""Little sister, let me in!"" 
Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said, 
""Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?"" 
""Oh yes,"" answered the maiden, ""but the fawn must come too. I could not leave him."" And the King said, 
""He shall remain with you as long as you live, and shall lack nothing."" Then the fawn came bounding in, and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him, and led him by her own hand out of the little house."
brother-sister,10,"The King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; so she became lady Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; the fawn was well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden. 
Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters. But when she heard that they were so happy, and that things had gone so well with them, jealousy and envy arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her chief thought was how to bring misfortune upon them."
brother-sister,11,"Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin, and had only one eye, complained to her, and said, 
""I never had the chance of being a Queen."" 
""Never mind,"" said the old woman, to satisfy her; ""when the time comes, I shall be at hand."" 
After a while the Queen brought a beautiful baby-boy into the world, and that day the King was out hunting. The old witch took the shape of the bedchamber woman, and went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her, 
""Come, the bath is ready; it will give you refreshment and new strength. Quick, or it will be cold."" 
Her daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the bath-room, and left her there. And in the bath-room they had made a great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen."
brother-sister,12,"When that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen's place, gave her also the Queen's form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye. So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the side where there was no eye. In the evening, when the King came home and heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart, and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did. Then the old woman cried hastily, 
""For your life, do not draw back the curtains, to let in the light upon her; she must be kept quiet."" So the King went away, and never knew that a false Queen was lying in the bed."
brother-sister,13,"Now, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the door open, and the true Queen come in. She took the child out of the cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. Then she shook out its little pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. She did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen no one. And the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; the nurse saw her always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one. 
After some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find voice, and said one night, ""My child my fawn twice more I come to see,     Twice more I come, and then the end must be."""
brother-sister,14,"The nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she went to the King and told him all. The King said, 
""Ah, heaven! what do I hear! I will myself watch by the child to-morrow night."" 
So at evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen appeared, and said, 
    ""My child my fawn once more I come to see,     Once more I come, and then the end must be."" 
And she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she vanished. The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the following night, and heard her say, 
    ""My child my fawn this once I come to see,     This once I come, and now the end must be."""
brother-sister,15,"Then the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her, saying, 
""You are no other than my dear wife!"" Then she answered, 
""Yes, I am your dear wife,"" and in that moment, by the grace of heaven, her life returned to her, and she was once more well and strong. Then she told the King the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had laid for her. The King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence was passed upon them. The daughter was sent away into the wood, where she was devoured by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended miserably. And as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn, and he took human shape again; and then the sister and brother lived happily together until the end."
buckwheat,1,"IF YOU should chance, after a tempest, to cross a field where buckwheat is growing, you may observe that it looks black and singed, as if a flame of fire had passed over it. And should you ask the reason, a farmer will tell you, ""The lightning did that."" But how is it that the lightning did it?"
buckwheat,2,"I will tell you what the sparrow told me, and the sparrow heard it from an aged willow which stood--and still stands for that matter--close to the field of buckwheat. This willow is tall and venerable, though old and crippled. Its trunk is split clear through the middle, and grass and blackberry tendrils creep out through the cleft. The tree bends forward, and its branches droop like long, green hair."
buckwheat,3,"In the fields around the willow grew rye, wheat, and oats--beautiful oats that, when ripe, looked like little yellow canary birds sitting on a branch. The harvest had been blessed, and the fuller the ears of grain the lower they bowed their heads in reverent humility. There was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willow. The buckwheat did not bow its head, like the rest of the grain, but stood erect in stiff-necked pride."
buckwheat,4,"""I am quite as rich as the oats,"" it said; ""and, moreover, I am much more sightly. My flowers are as pretty as apple blossoms. It is a treat to look at me and my companions. Old willow, do you know anything more beautiful than we?"" The willow nodded his head, as much as to say, ""Indeed I do!"" But the buckwheat was so puffed with pride that it only said: ""The stupid tree! He is so old that grass is growing out of his body."""
buckwheat,5,"Now there came on a dreadful storm, and the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads as it passed over them. The buckwheat flower alone stood erect in all its pride. ""Bow your heads, as we do,"" called the flowers. ""There is no need for me to do that,"" answered the buckwheat."
buckwheat,6,"""Bow your head as we do,"" said the grain. ""The angel of storms comes flying hither. He has wings that reach from the clouds to the earth; he will smite you before you have time to beg for mercy."" ""But I do not choose to bow down,"" said the buckwheat."
buckwheat,7,"""Close your flowers and fold your leaves,"" said the old willow. ""Do not look at the lightning when the cloud breaks. Even human beings dare not do that, for in the midst of the lightning one may look straight into God's heaven. The sight strikes human beings blind, so dazzling is it. What would not happen to us, mere plants of the field, who are so much humbler, if we should dare do so?"" ""So much humbler! Indeed! If there is a chance, I shall look right into God's heaven."" And in its pride and haughtiness it did so. The flashes of lightning were so awful that it seemed as if the whole world were in flames."
buckwheat,8,"When the tempest was over, both the grain and the flowers, greatly refreshed by the rain, again stood erect in the pure, quiet air. But the buckwheat had been burned as black as a cinder by the lightning and stood in the field like a dead, useless weed. The old willow waved his branches to and fro in the wind, and large drops of water fell from his green leaves, as if he were shedding tears. The sparrows asked: ""Why are you weeping when all around seems blest? Do you not smell the sweet perfume of flowers and bushes? The sun shines, and the clouds have passed from the sky. Why do you weep, old tree?"" Then the willow told them of the buckwheat's stubborn pride and of the punishment which followed. I, who tell this tale, heard it from the sparrows. They told it to me one evening when I had asked them for a story."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,1,"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the
South of Scotland, near the Border. It was not very far from Longtown. He was
known as Canonbie Dick. As he went up and down the country, he
almost always had a long string of horses behind him. He bought them at
one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big
penny by the transaction.

He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. The people who knew
him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one
else need be asked to do it.

One evening, he was returning from a fair at some distance from his
home with a pair of horses which he had not succeeded in selling. He was
riding over Bowden Moor, which lies to the west of the Eildon Hills.
These hills are, as all men know, the scene of some of the most famous
of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies. Also, so men say, they are the
sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights, who rest under the three
high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,2,"But little recked the horse-dealer of Arthur and his Knights, nor yet of
Thomas the Rhymer. He was riding along at a snail's pace, thinking over
the bargains which he had made at the fair that day. He was wondering when
he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses.

All at once he was startled by the approach of a venerable man, with
white hair and an old-world dress, who seemed almost to start out of the
ground, so suddenly did he make his appearance.

When they met, the stranger stopped. To Canonbie Dick's great
amazement, asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his
horses."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,3,"The wily horse-dealer thought that he saw a chance of driving a good
bargain. The stranger looked a man of some consequence; so he named
a good round sum.

The old man tried to bargain with him; but when he found that he had not
much chance of succeeding. No one ever did succeed in inducing
Canonbie Dick to sell a horse for a less sum than he named for it at
first. He agreed to buy the animals, and, pulling a bag of gold from the
pocket of his queerly cut breeches. He began to count out the price.

As he did so, Canonbie Dick got another shock of surprise. The
gold that the stranger gave him was not the gold that was in use at the
time, but was fashioned into Unicorns, and Bonnet-pieces, and other
ancient coins. It would be of no use to the horse-dealer in his
everyday transactions. But it was good, pure gold. He took it
gladly. He knew that he was selling his horses at about half as much
again as they were worth. ""So,"" thought he to himself, ""surely I cannot
be the loser in the long run."""
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,4,"Then the two parted, but not before the old man had commissioned Dick to
get him other good horses at the same price. The only stipulation he
made being that Dick should always bring them to the same spot, after
dark, and that he should always come alone.

And, as time went on, the horse-dealer found that he had indeed met a
good customer.

For, whenever he came across a suitable horse, he had only to lead it
over Bowden Moor after dark. He was sure to meet the mysterious,
white-headed stranger, who always paid him for the animal in
old-fashioned golden pieces.

And he might have been selling horses to him yet, for aught I know, had
it not been for his one failing."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,5,"Canonbie Dick was apt to get very thirsty. His ordinary customers,
knowing this, took care always to provide him with something to drink.
The old man never did so. He paid down his money and led away his
horses. There was an end of the matter.

But one night, Dick, being even more thirsty than usual. He was feeling
sure that his mysterious friend must live somewhere in the
neighbourhood. He saw that he was always wandering about the hillside
when everyone else was asleep. He hinted that he would be very glad to go
home with him and have a little refreshment."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,6,"""He would need to be a brave man who asks to go home with me,"" returned
the stranger; ""but, if thou wilt, thou canst follow me. Only, remember
this--if thy courage fail thee at that which thou wilt behold, thou wilt
rue it all thy life.""

Canonbie Dick laughed long and loud. ""My courage have never failed me
yet,"" he cried. ""Beshrew me if I will let it fail now. So lead on, old
man, and I will follow.""

Without a word the stranger turned and began to ascend a narrow path
which led to a curious hillock. From its shape, was called by the
country-folk the ""Lucken Hare."""
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,7,"It was supposed to be a great haunt of Witches. As a rule, nobody
passed that way after dark, if they could possibly help it.

Canonbie Dick was not afraid of Witches. He followed his
guide with a bold step up the hillside. It must be confessed that he
felt a little startled when he saw him turn down what seemed to be an
entrance to a cavern. He never remembered having seen any
opening in the hillside there before.

He paused for a moment, looking round him in perplexity, wondering where
he was being taken. His conductor glanced at him scornfully."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,8,"""You can go back if you will,"" he said. ""I warned you thou were going
on a journey that would try your courage to the uttermost."" There was a
jeering note in his voice that touched Dick's pride.

""Who said that I was afraid?"" he retorted. ""I was just taking note of
where this passage stands on the hillside, so as to know it another
time.""

The stranger shrugged his shoulders. ""Time enough to look for it when
thou wouldst visit it again,"" he said. And then he pursued his way, with
Dick following closely at his heels."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,9,"After the first yard or two they were enveloped in thick darkness. The horse-dealer would have been sore put to it to keep near his guide
had not the latter held out his hand for him to grasp. But after a
little space a faint glimmering of light began to appear, which grew
clearer and clearer. At last they found themselves in an enormous
cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in
sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give
light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that
they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast
apartment.

And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one
side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would
find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled
and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every
horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot
in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.

But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike
were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange
enchantment had been thrown over them. They had been suddenly turned
into black marble."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,10,"There was something so awesome in the still, cold figures. In the
unearthly silence that brooded over everything that Canonbie Dick,
reckless and daring though he was, felt his courage waning and his knees
beginning to shake under him.

In spite of these feelings, however, he followed the old man up the hall
to the far end of it. There was a table of ancient workmanship, on
which was placed a glittering sword and a curiously wrought
hunting-horn."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,11,"When they reached this table the stranger turned to him. He said, with
great dignity, ""Thou hast heard, good man, of Thomas of
Ercildoune--Thomas the Rhymer, as men call him. He who went to dwell for
a time with the Queen of Fairy-land, and from her received the Gifts of
Truth and Prophecy?""

Canonbie Dick nodded; for as the wonderful Soothsayer's name fell on his
ears, his heart sank within him and his tongue seemed to cleave to the
roof of his mouth. If he had been brought there to parley with Thomas
the Rhymer, then had he laid himself open to all the eldrich Powers of
Darkness.

""I that speak to you am he,"" went on the white-haired stranger. ""And I
have permitted thee thus to have thy desire and follow me hither in
order that I may try of what stuff thou art made. Before thee lies a
Horn and a Sword. He that will sound the one, or draw the other, shall,
if his courage fail not, be King over the whole of Britain. I, Thomas
the Rhymer, have spoken it. As thou knowest, my tongue cannot lie.
But list ye, the outcome of it all depends on thy bravery. It will
be a light task, or a heavy, according as thou layest hand on Sword or
Horn first."""
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,12,"Now Dick was more versed in giving blows than in making music. His
first impulse was to seize the Sword, then, come what might, he had
something in his hand to defend himself with. But just as he was about
to lift it the thought struck him that, if the place were full of
spirits, as he felt sure that it must be, this action of him might be
taken to mean defiance. This might cause them to band themselves together
against him.

So, changing his mind, he picked up the Horn with a trembling hand. He
blew a blast upon it, which, however, was so weak and feeble that it
could scarce be heard at the other end of the hall.

The result that followed was enough to appal the stoutest heart. Thunder
rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall. The charmed Knights
and their horses woke in an instant from their enchanted sleep. The
Knights sprang to their feet and seized their swords, brandishing them
round their heads. Their great black chargers stamped, and
snorted, and ground their bits, as if eager to escape from their stalls.
And where a moment before all had been stillness and silence, there was
now a scene of wild din and excitement."
canonbie-dick-and-thomas-of-ercildoune,13,"Now was the time for Canonbie Dick to play the man. If he had done so
all the rest of his life might have been different.

But his courage failed him, and he lost his chance. Terrified at seeing
so many threatening faces turned towards him, he dropped the Horn. He made one weak, undecided effort to pick up the Sword.

But, ere he could do so, a mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in
the hall. These were the words that it uttered:

    ""Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,
    Who did not draw the Sword before he blew the Horn.""

And, before Dick knew what he was about, a perfect whirlwind of cold,
raw air tore through the cavern, carrying the luckless horse-dealer
along with it. Hurrying him along the narrow passage through which
he had entered, dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and
shale. He fell right to the bottom. He was found, with little life left
in him, next morning, by some shepherds, He had just strength
enough left to whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,1,"Once upon a time there was a man who had a cat, and she ate so very
much that he did not want to keep her any longer. So he decided to tie
a stone around her neck, and throw her into the river; but before he
did so she was to have something to eat just once more. The woman
offered her a dish of mush and a little potful of fat. These she
swallowed, and then jumped out of the window. There stood the man on
the threshing-floor."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,2,"""Good-day, man in the house,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the man. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little, but my fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat, and I
am thinking over whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said she, and
she seized the man and ate him up. Then she went into the stable. There
sat the woman, milking.

""Good-day, woman in the stable,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat, is that you?"" said the woman. ""Have you eaten your
food?"" she asked.

""O, only a little to-day. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat.
""I have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and
the man in the house, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat
you as well,"" said she, and she seized the woman and ate her up.

""Good-day, cow at the manger,"" said the cat to the bell-cow."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,3,"""Good-day, cat,"" said the bell-cow. ""Have you had anything to eat yet

and the man in the house and the woman in the stable, and I'm thinking
over whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said the cat, and seized
the bell-cow and ate her up. Then she went up to the orchard, and there
stood a man who was sweeping up leaves.

""Good-day, leaf-sweeper in the orchard,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the man. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I

well,"" said she, and seized the leaf-sweeper and ate him up."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,4,"Then she came to a stone-pile. There stood the weasel, looking about
him.

""Good-day, weasel on the stone-pile,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the weasel. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the

weasel and ate him up."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,5,"After she had gone a while, she came to a hazel-bush. There sat the
squirrel, gathering nuts.

""Good-day, squirrel in the bush,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you already had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said
the squirrel.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I

well,"" said she, and seized the squirrel and ate him up."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,6,"After she had gone a little while longer, she met Reynard the fox, who
was peeping out of the edge of the forest.

""Good-day, fox, you sly-boots,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the fox.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I

up, too."
cat-who-could-eat-so-much,9,"Then she went into the wood, and when she had gone far and farther than
far, over hill and dale, she met a young bear.

""Good-day, little bear brown-coat,"" said the cat.

cat-who-could-eat-so-much,10,"When the cat had gone a bit further, she met the mother bear, who was
clawing at the tree-stems so that the bark flew, so angry was she to
have lost her little one.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the

child-of-mary,1,"FAR, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple. Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god-father to pay for the child's christening. All day long he went from one to another; but no one wanted to be the god-father. Toward evening, as he was going home, he met a very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid clothes, and seemed most kind and friendly. She offered to see that the child was christened, if she might be allowed to keep it afterward. The man replied that first he must ask his wife. But when he reached home and asked her she gave him a flat ""no."" The following day the man set out again; but no one wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay for the christening himself. No matter how hard the man begged, it was all of no avail. When he went home that evening, he again met the lovely lady, who looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as before. The man again told his wife what had happened to him, and added that if he could not find a god-father for his child the following day, they would probably have to let the lady take her, since she seemed to be so kind and friendly. The man then went out for the third time, and found no god-father that day. And so, when he once more met the friendly lady in the evening, he promised to let her have the child, if she would see that it was baptized. The following morning the lady came to the man's hut, and with her two other men. She then took the child and went to church with it, and it was baptized. Then she took it with her, and the little girl remained with her for several years, and her foster-mother was always good and kind to her."
child-of-mary,2,"Now when the girl had grown old enough to make distinctions, and had acquired some sense, it chanced that her foster-mother once wished to take a journey. ""You may go into any room you wish,"" she said to the girl, ""only you are not to go into these three rooms,"" and then she set out on her journey. But the girl could not resist opening the door to the one room a little way-and swish! out flew a star. When her foster-mother came home, she was much grieved to find that the star had flown out, and was so annoyed with her foster-child that she threatened to send her away. But the girl pleaded and cried, until at last she was allowed to remain."
child-of-mary,3,"After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another journey, and she forbade the girl, above all, to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she had not entered. And the girl promised her that this time she would obey her. But when she had been alone for some time, and had had all sorts of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room, she could no longer resist opening the second door a little way-and swish! out flew the moon. When the foster-mother returned, and saw the moon had slipped out, she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could keep her no longer, and that now she must go. But when the girl again began to cry bitterly, and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny her, she was once more allowed to remain."
child-of-mary,4,"After this the foster-mother wished to take another journey, and she told the girl, who was now more than half-grown, that she must take her request not to go, or even so much as peep into the third room, seriously to heart. But when the foster-mother had been away for some time, and the girl was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no longer. ""O,"" thought she, ""how pleasant it would be to take a peep into that third room!"" It is true, that at first she thought she would not do it, because of her foster-mother; yet when the thought returned to her, she could not hold back, after all; but decided that she should and must by all means take a peep. So she opened the door the least little bit and swish! out flew the sun. When the foster-mother then returned, and saw that the sun had flown out, she grieved greatly, and told the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer. The foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before; but all to no avail. ""No, I must now punish you,"" said the foster-mother. ""But you shall have your choice of either becoming the most beautiful of all maidens, without the power of speech, or the most homely, yet able to talk. But you must leave this place."" The girl said: ""Then I would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of speech""and such she became, but from that time on she was dumb."
child-of-mary,5,"Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and had wandered for a time, she came to a large, large wood, and no matter how far she went she could not reach its end. When evening came, she climbed into a high tree that stood over a spring, and sat down in its branches to sleep. Not far from it stood a king's castle, and early the next morning a serving-maid came from it, to get water from the spring for the prince's tea. And when the serving-maid saw the lovely face in the spring, she thought it was her own. At once she threw down her pail and ran back home holding her head high, and saying: ""If I am as beautiful as all that, I am too good to carry water in a pail!"" Then another was sent to fetch water, but the same thing happened with her; she, too, came back and said she was far too handsome and too good to go to the spring and fetch water for the prince. Then the prince went himself, for he wanted to see what it all meant. And when he came to the spring, he also saw the picture, and at once looked up into the tree. And so he saw the lovely maiden who was seated among its branches. He coaxed her down, took her back home with him, and nothing would do but that she must be his bride, because she was so beautiful."
child-of-mary,6,"But his mother, who was still living, objected: ""she cannot speak,"" said she, ""and, maybe, she belongs to the troll-folk."" But the prince would not be satisfied until he had won her. When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon the queen, the prince set a strong guard about her. But suddenly they all fell asleep, and her foster-mother came, cut the child's little finger, rubbed some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the queen, and said: ""Now you shall grieve just as I did when you let the star slip out!"" And with that she disappeared with the child. When those whom the prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again, they thought that the queen had devoured her child, and the old queen wanted to have her burned; but the prince loved her so very tenderly, that after much pleading he succeeded in having her saved from punishment, though only with the greatest difficulty."
child-of-mary,7,"When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of twice as many men as had first stood watch was again set about her. Yet everything happened as before, only that this time the foster-mother said to her: ""Now you shall grieve as I did when you let the moon slip out!"" The queen wept and pleaded-for when the foster-mother was there she could speak-but without avail. Now the old queen insisted that she be burned. But the prince once more succeeded in begging her free. When heaven gave her a third child, a three-fold guard was set about her. The foster-mother came while the guard slept, took the child, cut its little finger, and rubbed some of the blood on the queen's mouth. ""Now,"" said she, ""you shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip out!"" And now the prince could in no way save her, she was to be and should be burned. But at the very moment when they were leading her to the stake, the foster-mother appeared with all three children; the two older ones she led by the hand, the youngest she carried on her arm. She stepped up to the young queen and said: ""Here are your children, for now I give them back to you. I am the Virgin Mary, and the grief that you have felt is the same grief that I felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the moon and the sun slip out. Now you have been punished for that which you did, and from now on the power of speech is restored to you!"""
child-of-mary,8,"The happiness which then filled the prince and princess may be imagined, but cannot be described. They lived happily together ever after, and from that time forward even the prince's mother was very fond of the young queen."
chronicle-of-pancake,1,"Once upon a time there was a woman who had seven hungry children, and
she was baking pancakes for them. There was dough made with new milk,
and it lay in the pan, and was rising so plumply and comfortably, that
it was a pleasure to watch it. The children stood around it, and their
grandfather sat and looked on."
chronicle-of-pancake,2,"""Give me a little bit of pancake, mother, I'm so hungry!"" said one of
the children.

""Dear mother!"" said the second.

""Dear, sweet mother!"" said the third.

""Dear, sweet, good mother!"" said the fourth.

""Dear, best, sweet, good mother!"" said the fifth.

""Dear, best, sweet, good, dearest mother!"" said the sixth.

""Dear, best, sweet, good, dearest, sweetest mother!"" said the seventh,
and so they all begged around the pancake, one more sweetly than the
other, for they were all so hungry and so well-behaved.

""Yes, children, wait until it turns around,"" said she--until I have
turned it around, she should have said--""then you shall all have a
pancake, a lovely best-milk pancake. Just see how fat and comfortable it
is lying there!"""
chronicle-of-pancake,3,"When the pancake heard that it was frightened, turned itself around
suddenly, and wanted to get out of the pan. But it only fell on its
other side, and when this had baked a little, so that it took shape and
grew firmer, it leaped out on the floor. And it rolled off like a wheel,
out of the door, and down the street.

Hey there! The woman was after it with the pan in one hand, and the
spoon in the other, as fast as she could, and after her came the
children, and last of all, their grandfather came hobbling along."
chronicle-of-pancake,4,"""Will you wait! Halt! Catch it! Hold it!"" they all cried together, and
wanted to catch up with it and grab it on the run; but the pancake
rolled and rolled, and sure enough, it got so far ahead of them that
they could no longer see it, for it had nimbler legs than all of them.
After it had rolled a while it met a man.

""Good-day, pancake,"" said the man.

""Good-day, Man Tan,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast; but wait a little and let me
eat you!"" said the man.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers, too,
you'll find, so I think I can leave you as well, Man Tan!"" said the
pancake, and rolled and rolled until it met a hen."
chronicle-of-pancake,5,"""Good-day, pancake,"" said the hen.

""Good-day, Hen Glen,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast, wait a little and I will eat
you up!"" said the hen.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers,
too, you'll find, and Man Tan, so I think I can leave you as well, Hen
Glen!"" said the pancake, and rolled along the road like a wheel. Then it
met a rooster.

""Good-day, pancake,"" said the rooster.

""Good-day, Rooster Booster,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast. Wait a little and I will eat
you up!"" said the rooster.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers, too,
you'll find, and Man Tan and Hen Glen, and so I think I can leave you as
well, Rooster Booster,"" said the pancake, and rolled and rolled as fast
as ever it could. And after it had rolled a long time it met a duck."
chronicle-of-pancake,6,"""Good-day, pancake,"" said the duck.

""Good-day, Duck Tuck,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast. Wait a little and I will eat
you up!"" said the duck.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers, too,
you'll find, and Man Tan, and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster, so I think I
can leave you as well,"" said the pancake, and rolled on as fast as ever
it could. After it had rolled a long, long time, it met a goose."
chronicle-of-pancake,7,"""Good-day, pancake,"" said the goose.

""Good-day, Goose Loose,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast. Wait a little and I will eat
you up!"" said the goose.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers, too,
you'll find, and Man Tan and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster and Duck
Tuck, and I think I can leave you as well, Goose Loose,"" said the
pancake, and rolled away."
chronicle-of-pancake,8,"After it had again rolled for a long, long time, it met a gander.

""Good-day, pancake,"" said the gander.

""Good-day, Gander Meander,"" said the pancake.

""Dear, good pancake, don't roll so fast. Wait a little and I will eat
you up!"" said the gander.

""Mother Gray and grandpa I've left behind, and the seven squallers, too,
you'll find, and Man Tan and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster and Duck Tuck
and Goose Loose, and I think I can leave you as well, Gander Meander,""
said the pancake, and began to roll as fast as ever it could."
chronicle-of-pancake,9,"After it had rolled a long, long time, it met a pig.

""Good-day, pancake,"" said the pig.

""Good-day, Pig Snig,"" said the pancake, and began to roll as fast as
ever it could.

""Now wait a little,"" said the pig. ""You need not hurry so, for we can
keep each other company going through the forest and take our time, for
it is said to be haunted."" The pancake thought that such was quite apt
to be the case, and so they started off; but after they had gone a while
they came to a brook."
chronicle-of-pancake,10,"The pig swam across on his own bacon, which was easy enough; but the
pancake could not get across.

""Sit down on my snout,"" said the pig, ""and I will carry you over that
way."" The pancake did so.

""Uff, uff!"" said the pig, and swallowed the pancake in one mouthful.

      ""And now, since the pancake no further goes,
      This little chronicle comes to a close."""
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,1,"Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,2,"No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,3,"The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,4,"It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen, and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,5,"""For my part,"" said the eldest, ""I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming."" ""And I,"" said the youngest, ""shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.""They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,6,"Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:""Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?""""Alas!"" said she, ""you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go there.""""You are in the right of it,"" replied they; ""it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball."""
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,7,"Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,8,"Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.""I wish I could-I wish I could-""; she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, ""You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?""""Y-es,"" cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.""Well,"" said her godmother, ""be but a good girl, and I will contrive that you shall go."" Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, ""Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin."""
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,9,"Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,10,"She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a coachman,""I will go and see,"" says Cinderella, ""if there is never a rat in the rat-trap-we may make a coachman of him.""""You are in the right,"" replied her godmother; ""go and look."""
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,11,"Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After that, she said to her:""Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them to me.""She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy then said to Cinderella:""Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not pleased with it?""""Oh! yes,"" cried she; ""but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?"""
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,12,"Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,13,"She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for joy. The King's son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of:""Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!""The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,14,"The King's son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,15,"As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.""How long you have stayed!"" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.""If you had been at the ball,"" said one of her sisters, ""you would not have been tired with it. There came there the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.""Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the King's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:""She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been! Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.""""Ay, to be sure!"" cried Miss Charlotte; ""lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you are! I should be a fool.""Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,16,"The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked:If they had not seen a princess go out.Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,17,"What they said was very true; for a few days after the King's son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it. Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:""Let me see if it will not fit me.""Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said:It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let everyone make trial."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,18,"He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella's clothes, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before."
cinderella-or-the-little-glass-slipper,19,"And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:That she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love her.She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the Court."
comrade,1,"Once upon a time there was a peasant boy, who dreamed that he would get
a princess, from far, far away, that she was as white as milk, and
as red as blood, and so rich that her riches had no end. When he woke,
it seemed to him as though she were still standing before him. She
was so beautiful and winning that he could not go on living without her.
So he sold all that he had, and went forth to look for her. He wandered
far, and at last, in the winter-time, came into a land where the roads
all ran in straight lines, and made no turns. After he had wandered
straight ahead for full three months, he came to a city. And there a
great block of ice lay before the church door, and in the middle of it
was a corpse, and the whole congregation spat at it as the people passed
by. This surprised the youth, and when the pastor came out of the
church, he asked him what it meant. ""He was a great evil-doer,"" replied
the pastor, ""who has been executed because of his misdeeds, and has been
exposed here in shame and derision."" ""But what did he do?"" asked the
youth."
comrade,2,"""During his mortal life he was a wine-dealer,"" answered the pastor,
""and he watered the wine he sold.""

This did not strike the youth as being such a terrible crime. ""Even if
he had to pay for it with his life,"" said he, ""one might now grant him a
Christian burial, and let him rest in peace."" But the pastor said that
this could not be done at all. People would be needed to break him
out of the ice; and money would be needed to buy a grave for him from
the church; and the gravedigger would want to be paid for his trouble;
and the sexton for tolling the bells; and the cantor for singing; and
the pastor himself for the funeral sermon."
comrade,3,"""Do you think there is any one who would pay all that money for such an
arrant sinner's sake?"" inquired the pastor.

""Yes,"" said the youth. If he could manage to have him buried, he would
be willing to pay for the wake out of his own slender purse.

At first the pastor would hear nothing of it. But when the youth
returned with two men, and asked him in their presence whether he
refused the dead man Christian burial, he ventured no further
objections."
comrade,4,"So they released the wine-dealer from his block of ice, and laid him in
consecrated ground. The bells tolled, and there was singing, and the
pastor threw earth on the coffin, and they had a wake at which tears and
laughter alternated. But when the youth had paid for the wake, he had
but a few shillings left in his pocket. Then he once more set out on
his way. He had not gone far before a man came up behind him, and
asked him whether he did not find it tiresome to wander along all alone."
comrade,5,"""No,"" said the youth, he always had something to think about. The man
asked whether he did not need a servant.

""No,"" said the youth, ""I am used to serving myself, so I have no need of
a servant. No matter how much I might wish for one, I still would
have to do without, since I have no money for his keep and pay.""

""Yet you need a servant, as I know better than you do,"" said the man,
""and you need one upon whom you can rely in life and death. But if you
do not want me for a servant, then let me be your comrade. I promise
that you will not lose thereby, and I will not cost you a shilling. I
travel at my own expense, nor need you be put to trouble as regards my
food and clothing."""
comrade,6,"Under these circumstances the youth was glad to have him for a comrade,
and they resumed their journey, the man as a rule going in advance and
pointing out the way.

After they had wandered long through various lands, over hills and over
heaths, they suddenly stood before a wall of rock. The comrade knocked,
and begged to be let in. Then the rock opened before them, and after
they had gone quite a way into the interior of the hill, a witch came to
meet them and offered them a chair. ""Be so good as to sit down, for you
must be weary!"" said she."
comrade,7,"""Sit down yourself!"" answered the man. Then she had to sit down and
remain seated, for the chair had power to hold fast all that approached
it. In the meantime they wandered about in the hill, and the comrade
kept looking around until he saw a sword that hung above the door. This
he wanted to have, and he promised the witch that he would release her
from her chair if she would let him have the sword.

""No,"" she cried, ""ask what you will. You can have anything else, but not
that, for that is my Three-Sisters Sword!"" (There were three sisters to
whom the sword belonged in common.) ""Then you may sit where you are till
the world's end!"" said the man. And when she heard that she promised to
let him have the sword, if he would release her."
comrade,8,"So he took the sword, and went away with it; but he left her sitting
there, after all. When they had wandered far, over stony wastes and
desolate heaths, they again came to a wall of rock. There the comrade
again knocked, and begged to be let in. Just as before, the rock opened,
and when they had gone far into the hill, a witch came to meet them with
a chair and bade them be seated, ""for you must be tired,"" said she."
comrade,9,"""Sit down yourself!"" said the comrade. And what had happened to her
sister happened to her, she had to seat herself, and could not get up
again. In the meantime the youth and his comrade went about in the hill,
and the latter opened all the closets and drawers, until he found what
he had been searching for, a ball of golden twine. This he wished to
have, and promised he would release her from the chair if she would give
it to him. She told him he might have all she possessed; but that she
could not give him the ball, since it was her Three-Sisters Ball. But
when she heard that she would have to sit in the chair till the Day of
Judgment, she changed her mind. Then the comrade took the ball, and in
spite of it left her sitting where she was. Then they wandered for many
a day through wood and heath, until they came to a wall of rock. All
happened as it had twice before, the comrade knocked, the hill opened,
and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair, and bade them sit
down. The two had gone through many rooms before the comrade spied an
old hat hanging on a hook behind the door. The hat he must have, but the
old witch would not part with it, since it was her Three-Sisters Hat,
and if she gave it away she would be thoroughly unhappy. But when she
heard that she would have to sit there until the Day of Judgment if she
did not give up the hat, she at last agreed to do so. The comrade took
the hat, and then told her to keep on sitting where she sat, like her
sisters."
comrade,10,"At length they came to a river. There the comrade took the ball of
golden twine and flung it against the hill on the other side of the
river with such force that it bounded back. And when it had flown back
and forth several times, there stood a bridge, and when they had reached
the other side, the comrade told the youth to wind up the golden twine
again as swiftly as possible, ""for if we do not take it away quickly,
the three witches will cross and tear us to pieces."" The youth wound as
quickly as he could. Just as he was at the last thread, the witches
rushed up, hissing, flung themselves into the water so that the foam
splashed high, and snatched at the end of the thread. But they could not
grasp it, and drowned in the river."
comrade,11,"After they had again wandered on for a few days, the comrade said: ""Now
we will soon reach the castle in which she lives, the princess of whom
you dreamed, and when we reach it, you must go to the castle and tell
the king what you dreamed, and your journey's aim."" When they got there,
the youth did as he was told, and was very well received. He was given a
room for himself, and one for his servant, and when it was time to eat,
he was invited to the king's own table. When he saw the princess, he
recognized her at once as the vision of his dream. He told her, too, why
he was there, and she replied that she liked him quite well, and would
gladly take him, but first he must undergo three tests. When they had
eaten, she gave him a pair of gold shears and said: ""The first test
is that you take these shears and keep them, and give them back to me
to-morrow noon. That is not a very severe test,"" she said, and smiled,
""but, if you cannot stand it, you must die, as the law demands, and you
will be in the same case as the suitors whose bones you may see lying
without the castle gate."""
comrade,12,"""That is no great feat,"" thought the youth to himself. But the princess
was so merry and active, and so full of fun and nonsense, that he
thought neither of the shears nor of himself. While they were
laughing and joking, she secretly robbed him of the shears without his
noticing it. When he came to his room in the evening, and told what had
occurred, and what the princess had said to him, and about the shears
which she had given him to guard, his comrade asked: ""And have you still
the shears?""

The youth looked through all his pockets; but his shears were not there,
and he was more than unhappy when he realized that he had lost them."
comrade,13,"""Well, well, never mind. I will see whether I can get them back for
you,"" said his comrade, and went down into the stable. There stood an
enormous goat which belonged to the princess, and could fly through the
air more swiftly than he could walk on level ground. The comrade took
the Three-Sisters Sword, gave him a blow between the horns, and asked:
""At what time does the princess ride to meet her lover to-night?"" The
goat bleated, and said he did not dare tell. When the comrade had
given him another thump, he did say that the princess would come at
eleven o'clock sharp. Then the comrade put on the Three-Sisters Hat,
which made him invisible, and waited for the princess. When she came,
she anointed the goat with a salve she carried in a great horn, and
cried out: ""Up, up! over gable and roof, over land and sea, over hill
and dale, to my dearest, who waits for me in the hill!"""
comrade,14,"As the goat flew upward, the comrade swung himself up in back, and
then they were off like the wind through the clouds: it was not a long
journey. Suddenly they stood before a wall of rock, she knocked, and
then they took their way into the interior of the hill, to the troll who
was her dearest. ""And now a new suitor has come who wants to win me,
sweetheart,"" said she. ""He is young and handsome, but I will have none
but you,"" she went on, and made a great time over the troll. ""I have set
him a test, and here are the shears that he was to keep and guard. You
shall keep them now!"" Then both of them laughed as though the youth had
already lost his head. ""Yes, I will keep them, and take good care of
them, and a kiss from you shall pledge the truth, when crows are cawing
around the youth!"" said the troll. He laid the shears in an iron
chest with three locks. But at the moment he was dropping the shears
into the chest, the comrade caught them up. None could see him, for he
was wearing the Three-Sisters Hat. So the troll carefully locked the
empty chest, and put the key into a hollow double-tooth, where he kept
other magic things. ""The suitor could hardly find it there,"" said he."
comrade,15,"After midnight the princess set out for home. The comrade swung himself
up in back again, and the trip home did not take long.

The following noon the youth was invited to dine at the king's table.
But this time the princess kept her nose in the air, and was so haughty
and snappish that she hardly condescended to glance in the youth's
direction. But after they had eaten, she looked very solemn, and asked
in the sweetest manner: ""You probably still have the shears I gave you
to take care of yesterday?"""
comrade,16,"""Yes, here they are,"" said the youth; and he flung them on the table so
that they rang. The princess could not have been more frightened had he
thrown the shears in her face. But she tried to make the best of a bad
bargain, and said in a sweet voice: ""Since you have taken such good care
of the shears, you will not find it hard to keep my ball of gold twine
for me. I should like to have it back by to-morrow noon. But if you
cannot give it to me then, you must die, according to the law."" The
youth thought it would not be so very hard, and put the ball of gold
twine in his pocket. Yet the princess once more began to toy and joke
with him, so that he thought neither of himself nor of the ball of gold
twine, and while they were in the midst of their merry play she stole
the golden ball from him, and then dismissed him.

When he came up into his room, and told what she had said and done, his
comrade asked: ""And have you still the ball of gold twine?"""
comrade,17,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the youth, and thrust his hand into the pocket in
which he had placed it. But there was no ball in it, and he fell into
such despair that he did not know what to do.

""Do not worry,"" said his comrade. ""I will see whether I cannot get it
back for you."" He took his sword and his hat, and went to a smith and
had him weld twelve extra pounds of iron to his sword. Then, when he
entered the stable, he gave the goat such a blow between the horns with
it that he staggered, and asked: ""At what time does the princess ride to
her dearest to-night?""

""At twelve o'clock sharp,"" said the goat."
comrade,18,"The comrade once more put on his Three-Sisters Hat, and waited until the
princess came with the horn of ointment and anointed the goat. Then she
repeated what she had already said: ""Up, up! over gable and tower, over
land and sea, over hill and dale, to my dearest who waits for me in the
hill!"" And when the goat arose, the comrade swung himself up in back,
and off they were like lightning through the air. Soon they had reached
the troll-hill, and when she had knocked thrice they passed through the
interior of the hill till they met the troll who was her dearest.

""What manner of care did you take of the golden shears I gave you
yesterday, my friend?"" asked the princess. ""The suitor had them, and he
gave them back to me."""
comrade,19,"That was quite impossible, said the troll, for he had locked them up in
a chest with three locks, and had thrust the key into his hollow tooth.
But when they had unlocked the chest and looked, there were no shears
there. Then the princess told him that she had now given him her ball of
golden twine.

""Here it is,"" said she. ""I took it away from him again without his
having noticed it; but what are we to do if he is a master of such
arts?"""
comrade,20,"The troll could not think of anything to suggest. After they had
reflected a while they hit on the idea of lighting a great fire, and
burning the ball of gold twine, for then the suitor could surely not
regain it. Yet when she threw it into the flames, the comrade leaped
forward and caught it, without being seen, for he was wearing the
Three-Sisters Hat. After the princess had stayed a little while she
returned home, and again the comrade sat up behind, and the trip home
was swiftly and safely made. When the youth was asked to the king's
table, the comrade gave him the ball. The princess was still more sharp
and disdainful in her remarks than before, and after they had eaten she
pinched her lips, and said: ""Would it not be possible for me to get my
ball of gold twine again, which I gave you yesterday?""

""Yes,"" said the youth, ""you can have it; there it is!"" and he flung it
on the table with such a thud that the king leaped up in the air with
fright."
comrade,21,"The princess grew as pale as a corpse. She made the best of a bad
bargain, and said that he had done well. Now there was only one more
little test for him to undergo. ""If you can bring me what I am thinking
about by to-morrow noon, then you may have me and keep me.""

The youth felt as though he had been condemned to death. It seemed
altogether impossible for him to know of what the princess was thinking,
and still more impossible to bring her the thing in question. And when
he came to his room his comrade could scarcely quiet him. He said he
would take the matter in hand, as he had done on the other occasions,
and at last the youth grew calmer, and lay down to sleep. In the
meantime the comrade went to the smith, and had him weld an additional
twenty-four pounds of iron on his sword. When this had been done, he
went to the stable, and gave the goat such a smashing blow between the
horns that he flew to the other side of the wall."
comrade,22,"""At what time does the princess ride to her dearest to-night?"" said he.

""At one o'clock sharp,"" bleated the goat.

When the time came, the comrade was standing in the stable, wearing his
Three-Sisters Hat, and after the princess had anointed the goat and
spoken her formula, off they went through the air as before, with the
comrade sitting in back. But this time he was anything but gentle, and
kept giving the princess a cuff here, and a cuff there, until she had
received a terrible drubbing. When she reached the wall of rock, she
knocked three times, the hill opened, and they flew through it to her
dearest."
comrade,23,"She complained bitterly to him, and said she would never have thought it
possible that the weather could affect one so. It had seemed to her as
though some one were flying along with them, beating her and the goat,
and her whole body must be covered with black and blue spots, so badly
had she been thrashed. And then she told how the suitor had again had
the ball of twine. How he had managed to get it, neither she nor the
troll could guess.

""But do you know the thought that came to me?"" said she. Of course the
troll did not."
comrade,24,"""Well,"" said she, ""I have told him he is to bring me the thing I am
thinking of by to-morrow noon, and that thing is your head. Do you
think, dear friend, that he will be able to bring it to me?"" and she
made a great time over the troll.

""I do not think he can,"" said the troll, who felt quite sure of himself,
and laughed and chortled with pleasure in the most malicious way. For he
and the princess were firmly convinced that the youth would be more apt
to lose his own head, and be left to the ravens, than that he would be
able to bring the princess the head of the troll."
comrade,25,"Toward morning the princess wanted to fly home again, but she did not
venture to ride alone; the troll must accompany her. He was quite ready
to do so, took his goat from the stable--he had one just like that of
the princess--and anointed him between the horns. When the troll had
mounted, the comrade swung up in back of him, and off they were through
the air in the direction of the king's castle. But on the way the
comrade beat away lustily at the troll and his goat, and gave him thump
after thump, and blow after blow with his sword, until they were flying
lower and lower, and at last nearly fell into the sea across which their
journey led them. When the troll noticed how stormy the weather was, he
accompanied the princess to the castle, and waited outside to make sure
that she really came home safely. But the moment when the door closed on
the princess, the comrade hewed off his head, and went up with it to
the youth's room."
comrade,26,"""Here is the thing of which the princess was thinking,"" said he. Then
everything was in apple-pie order, and when the youth was invited to the
king's table and they had eaten, the princess grew as merry as a lark.
""Have you, perhaps, the thing of which I was thinking?"" ""To be sure,""
said the youth, and he drew forth the head from beneath his coat, and
flung it on the table so that the table and all that was on it fell
over. The princess looked as though she had come from the grave. Yet she
could not deny that this was the thing of which she had thought, and
now she had to take the youth, as she had promised. So the wedding was
celebrated, and there was great joy throughout the kingdom."
comrade,27,"But the comrade took the youth aside, and said that on their
wedding-night he might close his eyes and pretend to sleep.
If he loved his life, and followed his advice, he would not sleep a
wink until the princess was freed from her troll-skin. He must whip it
off with nine new switches of birch-wood, and strip it off with three
milk-baths beside. First he must scrub it off in a tub of year-old whey,
then he must rub it off in a tub of sour milk, and finally, he must
sponge it off in a tub of sweet milk. He had laid the birch switches
beneath the bed, and had stood the tubs of milk in the corner; all was
prepared. The youth promised to follow his advice, and do as he had
told him. When night came, and he lay in his bed, the princess raised
herself on her elbows, to see if he were really asleep, and she tickled
him under the nose; but he was sleeping quite soundly. Then she pulled
his hair and his beard. But it seemed to her that he slept like a log.
Then she drew a great butcher's knife out from beneath her pillow, and
wanted to cut off his head. But the youth leaped up, struck the knife
from her hand, seized her by the hair, whipped her with the switches,
and did not stop until not one was left. Thereupon he threw her into the
tub of whey, and then he saw what sort of creature she really was, for
her whole body was coal-black. But when he had scrubbed her in the whey,
and rubbed her in the sour milk, and sponged her in the sweet milk, the
troll-skin had altogether disappeared, and she was lovelier than she had
ever been before."
comrade,28,"On the following day the comrade said that now they must get on their
way. The youth was ready to set forth, and the princess, too, for her
dower had long since been made ready. During the night the comrade had
brought all the gold and silver, and all the valuables which the troll
had left in the hill to the castle. When they wanted to start in
the morning, the castle court-yard was so full they could scarcely get
through. The dower supplied by the troll was worth more than the king's
whole country, and they did not know how they were to take it home. But
the comrade found a way out of the difficulty. The troll had also left
six goats who could fly through the air. These he loaded so heavily
with gold and silver that they had to walk on the ground, and were not
strong enough to rise into the air. What the goats could not carry,
had to be left at the castle. Thus they traveled for a long time, but at
last the goats grew so weary and wretched that they could go no further.
The youth and the princess did not know what to do. When the comrade
saw that they could not move from the spot, he took the whole treasure
on his back, topped it with the goats, and carried it all until they
were no more than half a mile from the youth's home. Then the comrade
said: ""Now I must part from you, for I can stay with you no longer."" But
the youth would not hear of parting, and would not let him go at any
price."
comrade,29,"So he went along another half mile, but further than that he could not
go. When the youth pressed him, and insisted that he come home with
him, and stay there; or that he at least celebrate their home-coming,
he merely said no, he could not do so. Then the youth asked him what he
wished in the way of payment for his company and aid. ""If I am to wish
for something, then I would like to have half of all that you may gain
in the course of the next five years,"" said his comrade. And this was
promised him."
comrade,30,"Now when the comrade had gone, the youth hid all his treasure, and went
straight home. And there they celebrated a home-coming feast that was
talked about in seven kingdoms. When that was over they spent the
whole winter going back and forth with the goats, and his father's
twelve horses, bringing all the gold and silver home.

After five years the comrade came again and asked for his share. Then
the man divided all his possessions into two equal parts."
comrade,31,"""Yet there is one thing you have not divided,"" said the comrade.

""What could that be?"" asked the man. ""I thought I had divided
everything.""

""You have been blessed with a child,"" said the comrade, ""and that you
must also divide into two equal parts.""

Yes, such was really the case. Then he took up his sword, but when he
raised it and was about to divide the child, his comrade seized the
point of the sword so that he could not strike."
comrade,32,"""Are you not happy, since you need not strike?"" said he.

""Yes, indeed, I never was happier,"" said the man.

""That is how happy I was when you delivered me out of the block of
ice,"" said the comrade. ""Keep all you have: I need nothing, for I am a
disembodied spirit."" And he told him he was the wine-dealer who had lain
in the block of ice before the church door, spat upon by all. He had become his comrade, and had aided him, because the youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he might have peace, and a burial in consecrated ground. He had been permitted to accompany him for the space
of a year, and the time had run out when he had first parted with him.
Now he had once more been allowed to visit him; yet on this occasion he
would have to part for all time, for the bells of heaven were calling
him."
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,1,"In the long time ago, Conchubar, son of Ness, was King of Ulster, and he
held his court in the palace of Emain Macha. And this is the way he came
to be King. He was but a young lad, and his father was not living. Fergus, son of Rogh, who was at that time King of Ulster, asked his
mother Ness in marriage.

Now Ness, that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of
Ireland, had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness
that had been done to her. She planned to get the kingdom away from
Fergus for her own son. So she said to Fergus, ""Let Conchubar hold the
kingdom for a year, so that his children after him may be called the
children of a king. That is the marriage portion I will ask of you.""

""You may do that,"" the men of Ulster said to him. ""For even though
Conchubar gets the name of being king, it is yourself that will be our
King all the time."" So Fergus agreed to it, and he took Ness as his
wife, and her son Conchubar was made King in his place."
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,2,"But all through the year Ness was working to keep the kingdom for him.
She gave great presents to the chief men of Ulster to get them on
her side. And though Conchubar was but a young lad at the time, he was
wise in his judgments and brave in battle, and good in shape and in
form. They liked him well. And at the end of the year, when Fergus
asked to have the kingship back again, they consulted together. It
is what they agreed, that Conchubar was to keep it. And they said, ""It
is little Fergus thinks about us, when he was so ready to give up his
rule over us for a year. Let Conchubar keep the kingship,"" they
said, ""and let Fergus keep the wife he has got.""

Now, it happened one day that Conchubar was making a feast at Emain
Macha for the marriage of his sister Dechtire with Sualtim, son of Roig.
And at the feast Dechtire was thirsty, and they gave her a cup of wine,
and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup, and she drank it
down with the wine. And presently she went into her sunny parlour, and
her fifty maidens along with her, and she fell into a deep sleep. And in
her sleep Lugh of the Long Hand appeared to her, and he said, ""It is I
myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup, and it is with me you
must come away now, and your fifty maidens along with you."" And he put
on them the appearance of a flock of birds. They went with him
southward till they came to Brugh na Boinne, the dwelling-place of the
Sidhe. And no one at Emain Macha could get tale or tidings of them, or
know where they had gone, or what had happened them."
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,3,"It was about a year after that time there was another feast in Emain,
and Conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast. And suddenly
they saw from the window a great flock of birds, that lit on the ground
and began to eat up everything before them, so that not so much as a
blade of grass was left.

The men of Ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all
before them, and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them.
Conchubar was in his own chariot, and there were following with him
Fergus, son of Rogh, and Laegaire Buadach the Battle-Winner, and
Celthair, son of Uithecar, and many others, and Bricriu of the bitter
tongue was along with them.

They followed after the birds across the whole country southward, across
Slieve Fuad, by Ath Lethan, by Ath Garach and Magh Gossa, between Fir
Rois and Fir Ardae. The birds before them always. They were the most
beautiful that had ever been seen. Nine flocks of them there were,
linked together two-and-two with a chain of silver, and at the head of
every flock there were two birds of different colours, linked together
with a chain of gold. and There were three birds that flew by
themselves, and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the
country, until the fall of night, and then there was no more seen of
them."
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,4,"And when the dark night was coming on, Conchubar said to his people, ""It
is best for us to unyoke the chariots now, and to look for some place
where we can spend the night.""

Then Fergus went forward to look for some place, and what he came to was
a very small poor-looking house. A man and a woman were in it, and when
they saw him they said, ""Bring your companions here along with you, and
they will be welcome."" Fergus went back to his companions and told them
what he had seen. But Bricriu said: ""Where is the use of going into a
house like that, with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it.
It is not worth our while to be going there.""

Then Bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was. But when
he came to it, what he saw was a grand, new, well-lighted house. At
the door there was a young man wearing armour, very tall and handsome
and shining. And he said, ""Come into the house, Bricriu. Why are you
looking about you?"" And there was a young woman beside him, fine and
noble, and with curled hair, and she said, ""Surely there is a welcome
before you from me."" ""Why does she welcome me?"" said Bricriu. ""It is on
account of her that I myself welcome you,"" said the young man. ""And is
there no one missing from you at Emain?"" he said. ""There is, surely,""
said Bricriu. ""We are missing fifty young girls for the length of a
year."" ""Would you know them again if you saw them?"" said the young man.
""If I would not know them,"" said Bricriu, ""it is because a year might
make a change in them, so that I would not be sure."""
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,5,"""Try and know them
again,"" said the man, ""for the fifty young girls are in this house, and
this woman beside me is their mistress, Dechtire. It was they
themselves, changed into birds, that went to Emain Macha to bring you
here."" Then Dechtire gave Bricriu a purple cloak with gold fringes. He went back to find his companions. But while he was going he thought
to himself, ""Conchubar would give great treasure to find these fifty
young girls again, and his sister along with them. I will not tell him I
have found them. I will only say I have found a house with beautiful
women in it, and no more than that.""

When Conchubar saw Bricriu he asked news of him.

""What news do you bring back with you, Bricriu?"" he said. ""I came to a
fine well-lighted house,"" said Bricriu. ""I saw a queen, noble, kind,
with royal looks, with curled hair. I saw a troop of women, beautiful,
well dressed. I saw the man of the house, tall and open-handed and
shining."" ""Let us go there for the night,"" said Conchubar. So they
brought their chariots and their horses and their arms. They were
hardly in the house when every sort of food and of drink, some they knew
and some they did not know, was put before them, so that they never
spent a better night. And when they had eaten and drunk and began to be
satisfied, Conchubar said to the young man, ""Where is the mistress of
the house that she does not come to bid us welcome?"" ""You cannot see her
to-night,"" said he, ""for she is in the pains of childbirth."""
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,6,"So they rested there that night, and in the morning Conchubar was the
first to rise up. He saw no more of the man of the house, and what
he heard was the cry of a child. And he went to the room it came from,
and there he saw Dechtire, and her maidens about her, and a young child
beside her. And she bade Conchubar welcome, and she told him all that
had happened her, and that she had called him there to bring herself and
the child back to Emain Macha. And Conchubar said, ""It is well you have
done by me, Dechtire. You gave shelter to me and to my chariots. You
kept the cold from my horses. You gave food to me and my people, and now
you have given us this good gift. And let our sister, Finchoem, bring up
the child,"" he said. ""No, it is not for her to bring him up, it is for
me,"" said Sencha, son of Ailell, chief judge and chief poet of Ulster.
""For I am skilled. I am good in disputes. I am not forgetful. I speak
before anyone at all in the presence of the King. I watch over what he
says. I give judgment in the quarrels of kings. I am judge of the men of
Ulster. no one has a right to dispute my claim, but only Conchubar.""

""If the child is given to me to bring up,"" said Blai, the distributor,
""he will not suffer from want of care or from forgetfulness. It is my
messages that do the will of Conchubar. I call up the fighting men from
all Ireland. I am well able to provide for them for a week, or even for
ten days. I settle their business and their disputes. I support their
honour. I get satisfaction for their insults."""
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,7,"""You think too much of yourself,"" said Fergus. ""It is I that will bring
up the child. I am strong. I have knowledge. I am the King's messenger.
no one can stand up against me in honour or riches. I am hardened to war
and battles. I am a good craftsman. I am worthy to bring up the child. I
am the protector of all the unhappy. The strong are afraid of me. I am
the helper of the weak.""

""If you will listen to me at last, now you are quiet,"" said Amergin, ""I
am able to bring up a child like a king. The people praise my honour, my
bravery, my courage, my wisdom. They praise my good luck, my age, my
speaking, my name, my courage, and my race. Though I am a fighter, I am
a poet. I am worthy of the King's favour. I overcome all the men who
fight from their chariots. I owe thanks to no one except Conchubar. I
obey no one but the King.""

Then Sencha said, ""Let Finchoem keep the child until we come to Emain,
and Morann, the judge, will settle the question when we are there."""
cuchulain-of-muirthemne,8,"So the men of Ulster set out for Emain, Finchoem having the child with
her. And when they came there Morann gave his judgment. ""It is for
Conchubar,"" he said, ""to help the child to a good name, for he is next
of kin to him. Let Sencha teach him words and speaking. Let Fergus hold
him on his knees. Let Amergin be his tutor."" And he said, ""This child
will be praised by all, by chariot drivers and fighters, by kings and by
wise men. He shall be loved by many men. He will avenge all your wrongs. He will defend your fords. He will fight all your battles.""

And so it was settled. And the child was left until he should come to
sensible years with his mother Dechtire and with her husband Sualtim.
And they brought him up upon the plain of Muirthemne, and the name he
was known by was Setanta, son of Sualtim."
daniel-o-rourke,1,"People may have heard of the renowned adventures of Daniel O'Rourke, but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils, above and below, was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the Pooka's Tower. I knew the man well. He lived at the bottom of Hungry Hill, just at the right-hand side of the road as you go towards
Bantry. An old man was he at the time he told me the story, with grey
hair and a red nose; and it was on the 25th of June, 1813, that I heard
it from his own lips, as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar
tree, on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky. I was going to
visit the caves in Dursey Island, having spent the morning at
Glengariff."
daniel-o-rourke,2,"""I am often axed to tell it, sir,"" said he, ""so that this is not the
first time. The master's son, you see, had come from beyond foreign
parts in France and Spain, as young gentlemen used to go before
Buonaparte or any such was heard of; and, sure enough, there was a
dinner given to all the people on the ground, gentle and simple, high
and low, rich and poor. The ould gentlemen were the gentlemen, after
all, saving your honour's presence. They'd swear at a body a little, to
be sure, and, maybe, give one a cut of a whip now and then, but we were
no losers by it in the end; and they were so easy and civil, and kept
such rattling houses, and thousands of welcomes; and there was no
grinding for rent, and there was hardly a tenant on the estate that did
not taste of his landlord's bounty often and often in a year; but now
it's another thing. No matter for that, sir, for I'd better be telling
you my story."""
daniel-o-rourke,3,"Well, we had everything of the best, and plenty of it; and we ate, and
we drank, and we danced, and the young master, by the same token, danced with Peggy Barry, from the Bohereen--a lovely young couple they were, though they are both low enough now. To make a long story short, I got, as a body may say, the same thing as tipsy almost, for I can't remember, ever at all, no ways, how it was I left the place; only I did leave it, that's certain. Well, I thought, for all that, in myself, I'd just step
to Molly Cronohan's, the fairy woman, to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched; and so, as I was crossing the stepping-stones of the ford of Ballyashenogh, and was looking up at the stars, an 
blessing myself--for why? it was Lady-day--I missed my foot, and souse I fell into the water. 'Death alive!' thought I, 'I'll be drowned now!' However, I began swimming, swimming, swimming away for dear life, till at last I got ashore, somehow or other, but never the one of me can tell
how, upon a dissolute island."
daniel-o-rourke,4,"I wandered and wandered about there, without knowing where I wandered, until at last I got into a big bog. The moon was shining as bright as day, or your fair lady's eyes, sir (with your pardon for mentioning her), and I looked east and west, north and south, and every way, and nothing did I see but bog, bog, bog. I could never find out how I got into it; and my heart grew cold with fear, for sure and certain I was
that it would be my berrin' place. So I sat upon a stone, which, as
good luck would have it, was close by me, and I began to scratch my
head, and sing the ULLAGONE--when all of a sudden the moon grew black, and I looked up and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it, and I could not tell what it was. Down it came with a pounce, and looked at me full in the face; and what was it but an eagle?--as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of Kerry!"
daniel-o-rourke,5,"So he looked at me in the face, and says he to me, 'Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' 'Very well, I thank you, sir,' says I; 'I hope you're
well'; wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to
speak like a Christian. 'What brings you here, Dan?' says he. 'Nothing
at all, sir,' says I, 'only I wish I was safe home again.' 'Is it out of
the island you want to go, Dan?' says he. 'It is, sir,' says I; so I up
and told him how I had taken a drop too much, and fell into the water;
how I swam to the island; and how I got into the bog and did not know my way out of it."
daniel-o-rourke,6,"'Dan,' says he, after a minute's thought, 'though it is
very improper of you to get drunk on a Lady-day, yet, as you are a
decent sober man, who tends mass well, and never fling stones at me or
mine, nor cries out after one in the field, my life for yours,' says he;
'so get up on my back, and grip me well for fear you'd fall off, and
I'll fly you out of the bog.' 'I am afraid,' says I, 'your honour's
making game of me; for whoever heard of riding a-horseback on an eagle before?' 'Upon the honour of a gentleman,' says he, putting his right
foot on his breast, 'I am quite in earnest; and so now either take my
offer or starve in the bog--besides I see that your weight is sinking
the stone.'

It was true enough, as he said, for I found the stone every minute
going from under me. I had no choice; so, thinks I to myself, faint
heart never won fair lady, and this is fair persuadance. 'I thank your
honour,' says I, 'for the loan of your civility; and I'll take your kind
offer.' I therefore mounted on the back of the eagle, and held him tight
enough by the throat, and up he flew in the air like a lark."
daniel-o-rourke,7,"Little I
knew the trick he was going to serve me. Up, up, up--God knows how far
he flew. 'Why, then,' said I to him--thinking he did not know the right
road home--very civilly, because why? I was in his power entirely;
'sir,' says I, 'please your honour's glory, and with humble submission
to your better judgment, if you'd fly down a bit, you're now just over
my cabin, and I could be put down there, and many thanks to your
worship.'

'Arrah, Dan,' says he, 'do you think me a fool? Look down in the next
field, and don't you see two men and a gun? By my word, it would be no
joke to shoot this way, to oblige a drunken blackguard that I picked up
off a could stone in a bog.' 'Bother you,' says I to myself, but I
did not speak out, for where was the use? Well, sir, up he kept flying,
flying, and I asking him every minute to fly down, and all to no use.
'Where in the world are you going, sir?' says I to him. 'Hold your
tongue, Dan,' says he, 'and mind your own business, and don't be
interfering with the business of other people.' 'Faith, this is my
business, I think,' says I. 'Be quiet, Dan!' says he: so I said no more.

At last, where should we come to but to the moon itself. Now, you can't
see it from this, but there is, or there was in my time, a reaping-hook
sticking out of the side of the moon, this way (drawing the figure thus
on the ground with the end of his stick)."
daniel-o-rourke,8,"'Dan,' says the eagle, 'I'm tired with this long fly; I had no notion
it was so far.' 'And my lord, sir,' says I, 'who in the world axed you
to fly so far--was it I? Did not I beg and pray and beseech you to stop
half an hour ago?' 'There's no use talking, Dan,' said he; 'I'm tired
bad enough, so you must get off, and sit down on the moon until I rest
myself.' 'Is it sit down on the moon?' said I; 'is it upon that little
round thing, then? Why, then, sure, I'd fall off in a minute, and be
kilt and spilt, and smashed all to bits; you are a vile deceiver--so
you are.' 'Not at all, Dan,' says he; 'you can catch fast hold of the
reaping-hook that's sticking out of the side of the moon, and it will
keep you up.' 'I won't, then,' said I. 'Maybe not,' said he, quite
quiet."
daniel-o-rourke,9,"'If you don't, my man, I shall just give you a shake, and one
slap of my wing, and send you down to the ground, where every bone in
your body will be smashed as small as a drop of dew on a cabbage-leaf
in the morning.' 'Why, then, I'm in a fine way,' said I to myself, 'ever
to have come along with the likes of you'; and so, giving him a hearty
curse in Irish, for fear he'd know what I said, I got off his back with
a heavy heart, took hold of the reaping-hook and sat down upon the moon, and a mighty cold seat it was, I can tell you that.

When he had me there fairly landed, he turned about on me, and said,
'Good morning to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' said he; 'I think I've nicked
you fairly now. You robbed my nest last year' (it was true enough for
him, but how he found it out is hard enough to say), 'and in return you
are freely welcome to cool your heels dangling upon the moon like a
cockthrow.'"
daniel-o-rourke,10,"'Is that all, and is this how you leave me, you brute, you,' says I.
'You ugly unnatural baste, and is this the way you serve me at last?
Bad luck to yourself, with your hook'd nose, and to all your breed, you
blackguard.' It was all to no manner of use; he spread out his great big
wings, burst out a laughing, and flew away like lightning. I bawled
after him to stop; but I might have called and bawled for ever, without
his minding me. Away he went, and I never saw him from that day to
this--sorrow fly away with him! You may be sure I was in a disconsolate
condition, and kept roaring out for the bare grief, when all at once a
door opened right in the middle of the moon, creaking on its hinges as
if it had not been opened for a month before--I suppose they never
thought of greasing them--and out there walks--who do you think but the
man in the moon himself? I knew him by his bush.

'Good morrow to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' 'Very
well, thank your honour,' says I. 'I hope your honour's well.' 'What
brought you here, Dan?' said he. So I told him how I was a little
overtaken in liquor at the master's, and how I was cast on a dissolute
island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and the thief of an eagle
promised to fly me out of it, and how, instead of that, he had fled me
up to the moon."
daniel-o-rourke,11,"'Dan,' said the man in the moon, taking a pinch of snuff, when I was
done, 'you must not stay here.' 'Indeed, sir,' says I, 'it is much
against my will that I'm here at all; but how am I to go back?' 'That's
your business,' said he; 'Dan, mine is to tell you that you must not
stay, so be off in less than no time.' 'I'm doing no harm,' said I,
'only holding on hard by the reaping-hook lest I fall off.' 'That's what
you must not do, Dan,' says he. 'Pray, sir,' says I, 'may I ask how many
you are in family that you would not give a poor traveller lodging? I'm
sure it is not often you're troubled with strangers coming to see you,
for it is a long way.' 'I'm by myself, Dan,' says he, 'but you'd better
let go the reaping-hook.' 'Faith, and with your leave,' says I, 'I'll
not let go the grip, and the more you bids me the more I won't let
go--so I will.' 'You had better, Dan,' says he again. 'Why, then, my
little fellow,' says I, taking the whole weight of him with my eye from
head to foot, 'there are two words to that bargain; and I'll not
budge--you may, if you like.' 'We'll see how that is to be,' says he;
and back he went, giving the door such a great bang after him (for it
was plain he was huffed), that I thought the moon and all would fall
down with it."
daniel-o-rourke,12,"Well, I was preparing myself to try strength with him, when back he
comes, with the kitchen cleaver in his hand, and without saying a word
he gives two bangs to the handle of the reaping-hook that was holding me
up, and whap it came in two. 'Good morning to you, Dan,' says the
spiteful little blackguard, when he saw me cleanly falling down with a
bit of the handle in my hand; 'I thank you for your visit, and fair
weather after you, Daniel.' I had no time to make any answer to him, for
I was tumbling over and over, and rolling and rolling, at the rate of a
fox-hunt. 'God help me!' says I, 'but this is a pretty pickle for a
decent man to be seen in at this time of the night. I am now sold
fairly.' The word was not out of my mouth, when, whiz! what should fly
by close to my ear but a flock of wild geese, all the way from my own
bog of Ballyasheenagh, else how should they know me?"
daniel-o-rourke,13,"The ould gander, who was their general, turning about his head, cried out to me, 'Is that you, Dan?' 'The same,' said I, not a bit daunted now at what he said, for I was by this time used to all kinds of bedivilment, and,
besides, I knew him of ould. 'Good morrow to you,' says he, 'Daniel
O'Rourke; how are you in health this morning?' 'Very well, sir,' says I,
'thank you kindly,' drawing my breath, for I was mightily in want of
some, 'I hope your honour's the same.' 'I think it is falling you are,
Daniel,' says he. 'You may say that, sir,' says I. 'And where are you
going all the way so fast?' said the gander. So I told him how I had
taken the drop, and how I came on the island, and how I lost my way in
the bog, and how the thief of an eagle flew me up to the moon, and how
the man in the moon turned me out. 'Dan,' said he, 'I'll save you; put
out your hand and catch me by the leg, and I'll fly you home.' 'Sweet is
your hand in a pitcher of honey, my jewel,' says I, though all the time
I thought within myself that I don't much trust you; but there was no
help, so I caught the gander by the leg, and away I and the other geese
flew after him as fast as hops."
daniel-o-rourke,14,"We flew, and we flew, and we flew, until we came right over the wide
ocean. I knew it well, for I saw Cape Clear to my right hand, sticking
up out of the water. 'Ah, my lord,' said I to the goose, for I thought
it best to keep a civil tongue in my head anyway, 'fly to land, if you
please.' 'It is impossible, you see, Dan,' said he, 'for a while,
because, you see, we are going to Arabia.' 'To Arabia!' said I, 'that's
surely some place in foreign parts, far away. Oh! Mr. Goose, why, then,
to be sure, I'm a man to be pitied among you.'

'Whist, whist, you fool,' said he, 'hold your tongue; I tell you Arabia
is a very decent sort of place, as like West Carbery as one egg is like
another, only there is a little more sand there.'

Just as we were talking a ship hove in sight, sailing so beautiful
before the wind. 'Ah, then, sir,' said I, 'will you drop me on the ship,
if you please?' 'We are not fair over it,' said he; 'if I dropped you
now you would go splash into the sea.' 'I would not,' says I, 'I know
better than that, for it is just clean under us, so let me drop now at
once.'"
daniel-o-rourke,15,"'If you must, you must,' said he; 'there, take your own way'; and he
opened his claw, and, faith, he was right--sure enough, I came down
plump into the very bottom of the salt sea! Down to the very bottom I
went, and I gave myself up, then, for ever, when a whale walked up to
me, scratching himself after his night's sleep, and looked me full in
the face, and never the word did he say, but, lifting up his tail, he
splashed me all over again with the cold salt water till there wasn't a
dry stitch upon my whole carcass! And I heard somebody saying--it was a
voice I knew too--'Get up, you drunken brute, off of that'; and with
that I woke up, and there was Judy with a tub full of water, which she
was splashing all over me--for, rest her soul, though she was a good
wife, she could never bear to see me in drink, and had a bitter hand of
her own.

'Get up,' said she again; 'and of all places in the parish, would no
place sarve your turn to lie down upon but under the ould walls of
Carrigapooka? An uneasy resting I am sure you had of it.' And, sure
enough, I had, for I was fairly bothered out of my senses with eagles,
and men of the moons, and flying ganders, and whales, driving me through
bogs and up to the moon, and down to the bottom of the green ocean. If I
was in drink ten times over, long would it be before I'd lie down in the
same spot again, I know that!"
dschang-liang,1,"Dschang Liang was a native of one of those states which had been destroyed by the Emperor Tsin Schi Huang. And Dschang Liang determined to do a deed for his dead king's sake, and to that end gathered followers with whom to slay Tsin Schi Huang."
dschang-liang,2,"Once Tsin Schi Huang was making a progress through the country. When he came to the plain of Bo Lang, Dschang Liang armed his people with iron maces in order to kill him. But Tsin Schi Huang always had two traveling coaches which were exactly alike in appearance. In one of them he sat himself, while in the other was seated another person. Dschang Liang and his followers met the decoy wagon, and Dschang Liang was forced to flee from the Emperor's rage. He came to a ruined bridge. An icy wind was blowing, and the snowflakes were whirling through the air. There he met an old, old man wearing a black turban and a yellow gown. The old man let one of his shoes fall into the water, looked at Dschang Liang and said: ""Fetch it out, little one!"""
dschang-liang,3,"Dschang Liang controlled himself, fetched out the shoe and brought it to the old man. The latter stretched out his foot to allow Dschang Liang to put it on, which he did in a respectful manner. This pleased the old man and he said: ""Little one, something may be made of you! Come here to-morrow morning early, and I will have something for you.""

The following morning at break of dawn, Dschang Liang appeared. But the old man was already there and reproached him: ""You are too late. To-day I will tell you nothing. To-morrow you must come earlier."""
dschang-liang,4,"So it went on for three days, and Dschang Liang's patience was not exhausted. Then the old man was satisfied, brought forth the Book of Hidden Complements, and gave it to him. ""You must read it,"" said he, ""and then you will be able to rule a great emperor. When your task is completed, seek me at the foot of the Gu Tschong Mountain. There you will find a yellow stone, and I will be by that yellow stone."""
dschang-liang,5,"Dschang Liang took the book and aided the ancestor of the Han dynasty to conquer the empire. The emperor made him a count. From that time forward Dschang Liang ate no human food and concentrated in spirit. He kept company with the four whitebeards of the Shang Mountain, and with them shared the sunset roses in the clouds. Once he met two boys who were singing and dancing:

""Green the garments you should wear,
If to heaven's gate you'd fare;
There the Golden Mother greet,
Bow before the Wood Lord's feet!"""
dschang-liang,6,"When Dschang Liang heard this, he bowed before the youths, and said to his friends: ""Those are angel children of the King Father of the East. The Golden Mother is the Queen of the West. The Lord of Wood is the King Father of the East. They are the two primal powers, the parents of all that is male and female, the root and fountain of heaven and earth, to whom all that has life is indebted for its creation and nourishment. The Lord of Wood is the master of all the male saints, the Golden Mother is the mistress of all the female saints. Whoever would gain immortality, must first greet the Golden Mother and then bow before the King Father. Then he may rise up to the three Pure Ones and stand in the presence of the Highest. The song of the angel children shows the manner in which the hidden knowledge may be acquired."""
dschang-liang,7,"At about that time the emperor was induced to have some of his faithful servants slain. Then Dschang Liang left his service and went to the Gu Tschong Mountain. There he found the old man by the yellow stone, gained the hidden knowledge, returned home, and feigning illness loosed his soul from his body and disappeared.

Later, when the rebellion of the ""Red Eyebrows"" broke out, his tomb was opened. But all that was found within it was a yellow stone. Dschang Liang was wandering with Laotsze in the invisible world."
dschang-liang,8,"Once his grandson Dschang Dau Ling went to Kunlun Mountain, in order to visit the Queen Mother of the West. There he met Dschang Liang. Dschang Dau Ling gained power over demons and spirits, and became the first Taoist pope. And the secret of his power has been handed down in his family from generation to generation."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,1,"ONCE upon a time there was a poor tenant farmer who had a number of children whom he could feed but poorly, and had to clothe in the scantiest way. They were all handsome; but the most beautiful, after all, was the youngest daughter. She was beautiful beyond all telling."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,2,"Now it happened that one Thursday evening late in the fall there was a terrible storm raging outside. It was pitch dark, and it rained and stormed so that the house shook in every joint. The whole family sat around the hearth, and each was busy with some work or other. Suddenly there were three loud knocks on the window-pane. The man went out to see who was there. When he stepped outside, there stood a great white bear."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,3,"""Good evening,"" said the white bear.

""Good evening,"" returned the man.

""If you'll give me your youngest daughter, I will make you just as rich as now you are poor,"" said the bear."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,4,"The man was not ill-pleased that he was to become so rich. He did think that first he ought to speak to his daughter about it. So he went in again, and said that there was a white bear outside, who had promised to make him just as rich as he was poor now, if he could only have the youngest daughter for his bride. But the girl said no, and would not hear of it. Then the man went back to the bear again, and they both agreed that the white bear should return again the following Thursday and get his answer. In the meantime, however, the parents worked upon their daughter. They talked at length about all the riches they would gain, and how well she herself would fare. So at last she agreed, washed and mended the few poor clothes she had, adorned herself as well as she could, and made ready to travel. And what she was given to take along with her is not worth mentioning, either."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,5,"The following Thursday the white bear came to fetch his bride. The girl seated herself on his back with her bundle, and then he trotted off. After they had gone a good way, the white bear asked: ""Are you afraid?""

""No, not at all,"" she answered.

""Just keep a tight hold on my fur, and then you will be in no danger,"" said the bear. So she rode on the bear's back, far, far away, until at last they came to a great rock. There the bear knocked, and at once a door opened through which they entered a great castle, with many brilliantly lighted rooms, where everything gleamed with gold and silver. Then they came into a great hall, and there stood a table completely covered with the most splendid dishes. Here the white bear gave the maiden a silver bell, and said that if there were anything she wanted, she need only ring the bell, and she should have it at once. And after the maiden had eaten, and evening came on, she felt like lying down and going to sleep. So she rang her bell. At its very first peal she found herself transported to a room in which stood the most beautiful bed one might wish to have, with silken cushions and curtains with golden tassels. All that was in the room was of gold and silver."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,6,"Yet when she had lain down and put out the light, she saw a man come in and cast himself down in a corner. It was the white bear, who was allowed to throw off his fur at night. The maiden never actually saw him, for he never came until she had put out the light. Before dawn brightened he had disappeared again.

For a time all went well; but gradually the maiden grew sad and silent. She had not a soul to keep her company the live-long day, and she felt very homesick for her parents and sisters. When the white bear asked her what troubled her, she told him she was always alone, and that she wanted so very much to see her parents and sisters again. She felt very sad because she could not do so. ""O that can be managed,"" said the white bear. ""But first you must promise me that you will never speak to your mother alone; but only when others are present. Very likely she will take you by the hand, and want to lead you into her room, so that she can speak to you alone. But this you must not allow, otherwise you will make us both unhappy."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,7,"And then, one Sunday, the white bear actually came and told her that now she might make the trip to her parents. So she seated herself on the bear's back, and the bear set out. After they had gone a very long distance, they at length came to a fine, large, white house, before which her brothers and sisters were running about and playing. All was so rich and splendid that it was a real pleasure merely to look at it."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,8,"""This is where your parents live,"" said the white bear. ""Only do not forget what I told you, or you will make us both unhappy."" Heaven forbid that she should forget it, said the maiden. When she had come to the house, she got down, and the bear turned back.

When the daughter entered her parents' home, they were more than happy. They told her that they could not thank her enough for what she had done, and that now all of them were doing splendidly. Then they asked her how she herself fared. The maiden answered that all was well with her, also, and that she had all that heart could desire."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,9,"I do not know exactly all the other things she told them. I do not believe she told them every last thing there was to tell. So in the afternoon, when the family had eaten dinner, it happened as the white bear had foretold. The mother wanted to talk to her daughter alone, in her room. She thought of what the white bear had told her, and did not want to go with her mother, but said:

""All we have to say to each other can just as well be said here."" Yet she herself did not know exactly how it happened her mother finally did persuade her, and then she had to tell just how things were. So she informed her that as soon as she put out the light at night, a man came and cast himself down in the corner of the room. She had never yet seen him, for he always went away before the dawn brightened. And this grieved her, for she did want to see him so very much, and she was alone through the day, and it was very dreary and lonely."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,10,"""Alas, perhaps he is a troll, after all,"" said the mother. ""But I can give you some good advice as to how you can see him. Here is a candle-end, which you must hide under your wimple. When the troll is sleeping, light the light and look at him. But be careful not to let a drop of tallow fall on him.""

The daughter took the candle-end and hid it in her wimple, and in the evening the white bear came to fetch her.

After they had gone a way the white bear asked whether everything had not happened just as he had said. Yes, such had been the case, and the maiden could not deny it.

""If you have listened to your mother's advice, then you will make us both unhappy, and all will be over between us,"" said the bear. ""O, no, she had not done so,"" replied the maiden, indeed she had not."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,11,"When they reached home, and the maiden had gone to bed, all went as usual: a man came in and cast himself down in a corner of the room. But in the night, when she heard him sleeping soundly, she stood up and lighted the candle. She threw the light on him, and saw the handsomest prince one might wish to see. And she liked him so exceedingly well that she thought she would be unable to keep on living if she could not kiss him that very minute. She did so, but by mistake she let three hot drops of tallow fall on him, and he awoke."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,12,"""Alas, what have you done!"" cried he. ""Now you have made both of us unhappy. If you had only held out until the end of the year, I would have been delivered. I have a step-mother who has cast a spell on me, so that by day I am a bear, and at night a human being. But now all is over between us, and I must return to my step-mother. She lives in a castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon, where there is a princess with a nose three yards long, whom I must now marry.""

The maiden wept and wailed to no avail, for the prince said he must journey away. Then she asked him whether she might not go with him. No, said he, that could not be.

""But can you not at least tell me the road, so that I can search for you. For surely that will be permitted me?""

""Yes, that you may do,"" said he. ""But there is no road that leads there. The castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and neither now nor at any other time will you find the road to it!"""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,13,"When the maiden awoke the next morning, the prince as well as the castle had disappeared. She lay in a green opening in the midst of a thick, dark wood, and beside her lay the bundle of poor belongings she had brought from home. And when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and had cried her fill, she set out and wandered many, many days, until at last she came to a great hill. And before the hill sat an old woman who was playing with a golden apple. The maiden asked the woman whether she did not know which road led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose three yards long.

""How do you come to know him?"" asked the woman. ""Are you, perhaps, the maiden he wanted to marry?""

""Yes, I am that maiden,"" she replied."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,14,"""So you are that girl,"" said the woman. ""Well, my child, I am sorry to say that all I know of him is that he lives in the castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse, on which you may ride to my neighbor, and perhaps she can tell you. And when you get there just give the horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to go home. And here, take this golden apple along!""

The maiden mounted the horse, and rode a long, long time. At length she again came to a hill, before which sat an old woman with a golden reel. The maiden asked whether she could not tell her the road which led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. This woman said just what the other had, no, she knew no more of the castle than that it lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ""And,"" said she, ""you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse to ride to the nearest neighbor. Perhaps she can tell you. And when you have reached her just give the horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to go home again."" And finally she gave the maiden the golden reel, for, said the old woman, it might be useful to her."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,15,"The maiden then mounted the horse, and again rode a long, long time. At length she once more came to a great hill, before which sat an old woman spinning at a golden spindle. Then the maiden once more asked after the prince, and the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. And everything happened exactly as on the two previous occasions.

""Do you happen to be the maiden the prince wanted to marry?"" asked the old woman.

""Yes, I am that maiden,"" answered the maiden.

But this old woman knew no more about the road than the two others. ""Yes, the castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon, that I know,"" said she. ""And you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse, and you may ride on it to the East Wind and ask him. Perhaps he is acquainted there, and can blow you thither. And when you reach him, just give my horse a blow back of the left ear, and then he will return here of his own accord."" Finally the old woman gave her her golden spindle. ""Perhaps it may be useful to you,"" said she."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,16,"The maiden now rode for many days and weeks, and it took a long, long time before she came to the East Wind. But at last she did find him.Then she asked the East Wind whether he could show her the road that led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon.

O, yes, he had heard tell of the prince, and of the castle as well, said the East Wind. But he did not know the road that led to it, for he had never blown so far. ""But if you wish, I will take you to my brother, the West Wind, and perhaps he can tell you, for he is much stronger than I am. Just sit down on my back, and I will carry you to him."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,17,"The maiden did as he told her, and then they moved swiftly away. When they came to the West Wind, the East Wind said that here he was bringing the maiden whom the prince who lived in the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon had wanted to marry. He said that she was journeying on her way to him, and looking for him everywhere. He said that he had accompanied her in order to find out whether the West Wind knew where this castle might be.

""No,"" said the West Wind to the maiden, ""I have never blown so far, but if you wish I will take you to the South Wind, who is much stronger than both of us. He has traveled far and wide, and perhaps he can tell you. Seat yourself on my back, and I will carry you to him."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,18,"The maiden did so, and then they flew quickly off to the South Wind. When they found him, the West Wind asked whether the South Wind could show them the road that led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. He also said that this was the maiden who was to have the prince.

""Well, well, so this is the girl?"" cried the South Wind. ""Yes, it is true that I have gone about a good deal during my life,"" said he, ""yet I have never blown so far. But if you wish, I will take you to my brother, the North Wind. He is the oldest and strongest of us all. If he does not know where the castle lies, then no one in the whole world can tell you. Seat yourself on my back, and I will carry you to him."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,19,"The maiden seated herself on the back of the South Wind, and he flew away with a roar and a rush. The journey did not take long.

When they had reached the dwelling of the North Wind, the latter was so wild and unmannerly that he blew a cold blast at them while they were still a good way off. ""What do you want?"" cried he, as soon as he caught sight of them, so that a cold shiver ran down their backs.

""You should not greet us so rudely,"" said the South Wind. ""It is I, the South Wind. And this is the maiden who wanted to marry the prince who lives in the castle that lies east of the sun and west of the moon. She wishes to ask you whether you have ever been there, and if you can show her the road that leads to it. She would like to find the prince again."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,20,"""O, yes, I know very well where the castle lies,"" said the North Wind. ""I blew an aspen leaf there just once, and then I was so weary that I could not blow at all for many a long day. But if you want to get there above all things, and are not afraid of me, I will take you on my back, and see whether I can blow you there.""

The maiden said that she must and would get to the castle, if it were by any means possible. She was not afraid, no matter how hard the journey might be. ""Very well, then you must stay here over night,"" said the North Wind. ""For if we are to get there to-morrow, we must have the whole day before us."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,21,"Early the next morning the North Wind awakened the maiden. Then he blew himself up, and made himself so large and thick that he was quite horrible to look at. Thereupon they rushed along through the air as though they meant to reach the end of the world at once. And everywhere beneath them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out by the roots, and houses torn down. As they rushed across the sea, ships foundered by the hundreds. Further and further they went, so far that no one could even imagine it, and still they were flying across the sea. Gradually the North Wind grew weary, and became weaker and weaker. Finally he could hardly keep going, and sank lower and lower. At last he flew so low that the waves washed his ankles."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,22,"""Are you afraid?"" asked the North Wind.

""No, not at all,"" answered the maiden. By now they were not far distant from the land. The North Wind had just enough strength left to be able to set down the maiden on the strand, beneath the windows of the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. And then he was so wearied and wretched that he had to rest many a long day before he could set out for home again.

The next morning the maiden seated herself beneath the windows of the castle and played with the golden apple. The first person who showed herself was the monster with the nose, whom the prince was to marry."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,23,"""What do you want for your golden apple?"" asked the princess with the nose, as she opened the window.

""I will not sell it at all, either for gold or for money,"" answered the maiden.

""Well, what do you want for it, if you will not sell it either for gold or for money?"" asked the princess. ""Ask what you will!""

""I only want to speak to-night to the prince who lives here, then I will give you the apple,"" said the maiden who had come with the North Wind."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,24,"The princess replied that this could be arranged, and then she received the golden apple. But when the maiden came into the prince's room in the evening, he was sleeping soundly. She called and shook him, wept and wailed. But she could not wake him, and in the morning, as soon as it dawned, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,25,"That day the maiden again sat beneath the windows of the castle, and wound her golden reel. And all went as on the preceding day. The princess asked what she wanted for the reel, and the maiden answered that she would sell it neither for gold nor for money. If she might speak that night to the prince, then she would give the reel to the princess. Yet when the maiden came to the prince, he was again fast asleep, and no matter how much she wept and wailed, and cried and shook, she could not wake him. But as soon as day dawned, and it grew bright, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out. And that day the maiden again seated herself beneath the windows of the castle, and spun with her golden spindle. Of course, the princess with the long nose wanted to have that, too. She opened the window, and asked what she wanted for the golden spindle. The maiden replied, as she had twice before, that she would sell the spindle neither for gold nor money. The princess could have it if she might speak to the prince again that night. Yes, that she was welcome to do, said the princess, and took the golden spindle. Now it happened that some Christians, who were captives in the castle, and quartered in a room beside that of the prince, had heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the prince's room for the past two nights. So they told the prince. And that evening when the princess came to him with his night-cap, the prince pretended to drink it. He instead poured it out behind his back, for he could well imagine that she had put a sleeping-powder into the cup. Then, when the maiden came in, the prince was awake, and she had to tell him just how she had found the castle."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,26,"""You have come just in the nick of time,"" said he, ""for to-morrow I am to marry the princess. I do not want the monster with the nose at all, and you are the only person who can save me. I will say that first I wish to see whether my bride is a capable housewife, and demand that she wash the three drops of tallow from my shirt. She will naturally agree to this, for she does not know that you made the spots, for only Christian hands can wash them out again, but not the hands of this pack of trolls. Then I will say I will marry none other than the maiden who can wash out the spots, and ask you to do so,"" said the prince. And then both rejoiced and were happy beyond measure."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,27,"But on the following day, when the wedding was to take place, the prince said: ""First I would like to see what my bride can do!"" Yes, that was no more than right, said his mother-in-law. ""I have a very handsome shirt,"" continued the prince, ""which I would like to wear at the wedding. But there are three tallow-spots on it, and they must first be washed out. And I have made a vow to marry none other than the woman who can do this. So if my bride cannot manage to do it, then she is worthless."""
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,28,"Well, that would not be much of a task, said the women, and agreed to the proposal. And the princess with the long nose at once began to wash. She washed with all her might and main, and took the greatest pains, but the longer she washed and rubbed, the larger grew the spots.

""O, you don't know how to wash!"" said her mother, the old troll-wife. ""Just give it to me!"" But no sooner had she taken the shirt in her hand, than it began to look worse, and the more she washed and rubbed, the larger and blacker grew the spots. Then the other troll-women had to come and wash. The longer they washed the shirt the uglier it grew, and finally it looked as though it had been hanging in the smokestack."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,29,"""Why, all of you are worthless!"" said the prince. ""Outside the window sits a beggar-girl. I'm sure she is a better washer-woman than all of you put together. You, girl, come in here!"" he cried out of the window; and when the maiden came in he said: ""Do you think you can wash this shirt clean for me?""

""I do not know,"" answered the maiden, ""but I will try."" And no more had she dipped the shirt in the water than it turned as white as newly fallen snow, yes, even whiter.

""Indeed, and you are the one I want!"" said the prince."
east-of-sun-and-west-of-moon,30,"Then the old troll-woman grew so angry that she burst in two. The princess with the long nose and the rest of the troll-pack probably burst in two as well, for I never heard anything more of them. The prince and his bride then freed all the Christians who had been kept captive in the castle, and packed up as much gold and silver as they could possibly take with them, and went far away from the castle that lies East of the sun and West of the moon."
evil-one-kitta-grau,1,"One day the devil met Kitta Grau:

""Where have you been, old man?"" asked Kitta Grau, for she recognized him.

""Well,"" said the evil one, ""I have been out on the farm where the newly wedded couple live. This is the third time I have tried to sow dissension between them. But they think so much of each other that it is a sheer impossibility.""

""You talk like a real stupid. That is something I could bring about the very first time I went there,"" said Kitta Grau.

""If you can do that, you shall have a splendid pair of shoes,"" was the evil one's reply.

""Mind you keep your word!"" said Kitta, and turned toward the farm.

There the woman was home alone, for her husband had gone to the forest. Kitta said to the young wife:

""You really have a splendid husband."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,2,"""And that is the truth,"" the woman replied, ""for he grants my every wish before it is spoken.""

""But take my word for it,"" said Kitta, ""there is still a bit of deceit in him. He has a pair of long hairs under his chin. If you could get at them with a razor, and cut them off while he is asleep, then he would be altogether without malice.""

""Well,"" said the woman, ""if that will help, I will be sure to keep an eye open after dinner and attend to it, for then he always takes a little noon-day nap.""

Then Kitta Grau went out into the forest to the husband and bade him good-day.

""You really have a very good wife,"" said Kitta.

""She could not be better,"" replied the husband.

""Well you might be mistaken for all that,"" said Kitta. ""When you come home, be on your guard. When you go to take your noon-day nap, she has in mind to cut your throat. So be sure not to go to sleep."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,3,"The husband did not think much of the matter. Still, he thanked Kitta Grau for her trouble.

Then he went home and ate his dinner, laid down and pretended to fall asleep at once.

Then his wife went to his shaving-kit, took out his razor, went softly up to him and took hold of his chin with her hand.

Up flew the man."
evil-one-kitta-grau,4,"""Do you want to murder me?"" he cried, and gave his wife such a thump that she measured her full length on the floor.

And from that day forward there was no peace in the house. Now Kitta Grau was to receive her reward from the evil one. But he was so afraid of her that he did not venture to give her the shoes until he stood on one side of a stream, while she stood on the other, and then he passed them over to her on a long pole.

""You are ever so much worse than I am,"" he told Kitta Grau."
evil-one-kitta-grau,5,"The black man had made a bargain with a merchant. He had promised him that all goods which he might buy he should sell again within three weeks' time at a handsome profit. But, if he had prospered, after seven years had passed he was to be the devil's own. And he did prosper, for no matter what manner of old trash the merchant bought, and if it were no more than an old worn-out fur coat, he was always able to sell it again, and always at a profit.

Kitta Grau came into his shop and showed him the handsome shoes the evil one had given her."
evil-one-kitta-grau,6,"So the merchant said:

""May heaven keep me from him! He will surely fetch me when the time comes. I have made a pact with him and I have been unable to buy anything without selling it again in three weeks' time.""

Then Kitta Grau said: ""Buy me, for I am sure no one will buy me from you!"" And that is what the merchant did. He bought Kitta, had her disrobe and cover herself with tar, and roll in a pile of feathers. Then he put her in a glass cage as though she were a bird."
evil-one-kitta-grau,7,"Now the first week went by, and the second week went by, and the third week went by, and no one appeared who wanted to buy the curious bird. And then, in due time, came the evil one, and wanted to fetch his merchant.

""Have patience,"" said the merchant, ""I still have something I have bought, but have not been able to sell again in three weeks' time."""
evil-one-kitta-grau,8,"""That is something I'd like to see,"" said the black man. Then the merchant showed him Kitta Grau, sitting in her glass cage. But no sooner had the evil one seen the handsome bird than he cried:

""Oh, I see! It is you Kitta Grau! No one who knows you would buy you!""

And with that he hurried on his way.

Thus Kitta Grau could help do evil, and help do good."
fairy-gifts,1,"It generally happens that people's surroundings reflect more or less
accurately their minds and dispositions. Perhaps that is why the
Flower Fairy lived in a lovely palace, with the most delightful
garden you can imagine. It was full of flowers, and trees, and fountains, and
fish-ponds, and everything nice. For the Fairy herself was so kind
and charming that everybody loved her. All the young princes and
princesses who formed her court, were as happy as the day was long,
simply because they were near her. They came to her when they were quite
tiny, and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away
into the great world. When that time came she gave to each whatever
gift he asked of her. But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you
are going to hear now. The Fairy loved her with all her heart, for she
was at once original and gentle. She had nearly reached the age at
which the gifts were generally bestowed. However, the Fairy had a great
wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her,
were prospering. Before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she
resolved to send her to some of them. So one day her chariot, drawn by
butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said: 'Sylvia, I am going to
send you to the court of Iris. She will receive you with pleasure for
my sake as well as for your own. In two months you may come back to me
again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her.'

Sylvia was very unwilling to go away, but as the Fairy wished it she
said nothing. Only when the two months were over she stepped joyfully
into the butterfly chariot. She could not get back quickly enough to the
Flower-Fairy, who, for her part, was equally delighted to see her again."
fairy-gifts,2,"'Now, child,' said she, 'tell me what impression you have received.'

'You sent me, madam,' answered Sylvia, 'to the Court of Iris, on whom
you had bestowed the gift of beauty. She never tells anyone, however,
that it was your gift, though she often speaks of your kindness in
general. It seemed to me that her loveliness, which fairly dazzled me at
first, had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts
or graces. In allowing herself to be seen, she appeared to think
that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her. But,
unfortunately, while I was still with her she became seriously ill. 
Though she presently recovered, her beauty is entirely gone, so that she
hates the very sight of herself, and is in despair. She entreated me to
tell you what had happened, and to beg you, in pity, to give her beauty
back to her. And, indeed, she does need it terribly, for all the things
in her that were tolerable, and even agreeable, when she was so pretty,
seem quite different now she is ugly. It is so long since she
thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness, that I really don't
think she has any left now. She is quite aware of all this herself, so
you may imagine how unhappy she is, and how earnestly she begs for your
aid.'"
fairy-gifts,3,"'You have told me what I wanted to know,' cried the Fairy, 'but alas! I
cannot help her. My gifts can be given but once.'

Some time passed in all the usual delights of the Flower-Fairy's palace,
and then she sent for Sylvia again. She told her she was to stay for a
little while with the Princess Daphne. Accordingly the butterflies
whisked her off, and set her down in quite a strange kingdom. She
had only been there a very little time before a wandering butterfly
brought a message from her to the Fairy, begging that she might be sent
for as soon as possible. Before very long she was allowed to return.

'Ah! madam,' cried she, 'what a place you sent me to that time!'

'Why, what was the matter?' asked the Fairy. 'Daphne was one of the
princesses who asked for the gift of eloquence, if I remember rightly.'

'And very ill the gift of eloquence becomes a woman,' replied Sylvia,
with an air of conviction. 'It is true that she speaks well, and her
expressions are well chosen. But then she never leaves off talking, and
though at first one may be amused, one ends by being wearied to death.
Above all things she loves any assembly for settling the affairs of her
kingdom. On those occasions she can talk and talk without fear of
interruption. Even then, the moment it is over she is ready to
begin again about anything or nothing, as the case may be. Oh! how glad
I was to come away I cannot tell you.'"
fairy-gifts,4,"The Fairy smiled at Sylvia's unfeigned disgust at her late experience.
After allowing her a little time to recover she sent her to the
Court of the Princess Cynthia, where she left her for three months.
At the end of that time Sylvia came back to her with all the joy and
contentment that one feels at being once more beside a dear friend. The
Fairy, as usual, was anxious to hear what she thought of Cynthia, who
had always been amiable, and to whom she had given the gift of pleasing.

'I thought at first,' said Sylvia, 'that she must be the happiest
Princess in the world. She had a thousand lovers who vied with one
another in their efforts to please and gratify her. Indeed, I had nearly
decided that I would ask a similar gift.'

'Have you altered your mind, then?' interrupted the Fairy.

'Yes, indeed, madam,' replied Sylvia. 'and I will tell you why. The
longer I stayed the more I saw that Cynthia was not really happy. In her
desire to please everyone she ceased to be sincere, and degenerated
into a mere coquette. Even her lovers felt that the charms and
fascinations which were exercised upon all who approached her without
distinction were valueless, so that in the end they ceased to care for
them, and went away disdainfully.'

'I am pleased with you, child,' said the Fairy; 'enjoy yourself here for
awhile and presently you shall go to Phyllida.'"
fairy-gifts,5,"Sylvia was glad to have leisure to think, for she could not make up her
mind at all what she should ask for herself, and the time was drawing
very near. However, before very long the Fairy sent her to Phyllida, and
waited for her report with unabated interest.

'I reached her court safely,' said Sylvia, 'and she received me with
much kindness, and immediately began to exercise upon me that brilliant
wit which you had bestowed upon her. I confess that I was fascinated
by it, and for a week thought that nothing could be more desirable. The
time passed like magic, so great was the charm of her society. But I
ended by ceasing to covet that gift more than any of the others I
have seen, for, like the gift of pleasing, it cannot really give
satisfaction. By degrees I wearied of what had so delighted me at first,
especially as I perceived more and more plainly that it is impossible
to be constantly smart and amusing without being frequently ill-natured,
and too apt to turn all things, even the most serious, into mere
occasions for a brilliant jest.'

The Fairy in her heart agreed with Sylvia's conclusions, and felt
pleased with herself for having brought her up so well."
fairy-gifts,6,"But now the time was come for Sylvia to receive her gift, and all her
companions were assembled. The Fairy stood in the midst and in the usual
manner asked what she would take with her into the great world.

Sylvia paused for a moment, and then answered: 'A quiet spirit.' And the
Fairy granted her request.

This lovely gift makes life a constant happiness to its possessor, and
to all who are brought into contact with her. She has all the beauty of
gentleness and contentment in her sweet face. If at times it seems
less lovely through some chance grief or disquietude, the hardest thing
that one ever hears said is:

'Sylvia's dear face is pale to-day. It grieves one to see her so.'

And when, on the contrary, she is gay and joyful, the sunshine of her
presence rejoices all who have the happiness of being near her."
farmer-and-badger,1,"Long, long ago, there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains, far from any town. Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger. This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer's field and spoil the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating. The badger at last grew so ruthless in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured farmer could not stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it. So he lay in wait day after day and night after night, with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in vain. Then he laid traps for the wicked animal."
farmer-and-badger,2,"The farmer's trouble and patience was rewarded, for one fine day on going his rounds he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose. The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy, and carried him home securely bound with rope. When he reached the house the farmer said to his wife:

""I have at last caught the bad badger. You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape, because I want to make him into soup to-night."""
farmer-and-badger,3,"Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to his work in the fields. The badger was in great distress, for he did not at all like the idea of being made into soup that night, and he thought and thought for a long time, trying to hit upon some plan by which he might escape. It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, for he had been hung upside down. Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer's old wife pounding barley. She looked tired and old. Her face was seamed with many wrinkles, and was as brown as leather, and every now and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which rolled down her face."
farmer-and-badger,4,"""Dear lady,"" said the wily badger, ""you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age. Won't you let me do that for you? My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for a little while!""

""Thank you for your kindness,"" said the old woman, ""but I cannot let you do this work for me because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone."""
farmer-and-badger,5,"Now, the badger is one of the most cunning of animals, and he said again in a very sad, gentle, voice:

""You are very unkind. You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape. If you are afraid of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley. I am so tired and sore tied up like this. If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful!"""
farmer-and-badger,6,"The old woman had a good and simple nature, and could not think badly of any one. Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away. She felt sorry, too, for the animal as she turned to look at him. He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the knots were cutting into the skin. So in the kindness of her heart, and believing the creature's promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down."
farmer-and-badger,7,"The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested. He took the pestle, but instead of doing the work as he was told, the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood. He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her, and waited for the return of the old farmer. The old man worked hard in his fields all day, and as he worked he thought with pleasure that no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger."
farmer-and-badger,8,"Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home. He was very tired, but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him. The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind.

The badger meanwhile assumed the old woman's form, and as soon as he saw the old farmer approaching came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house, saying:

""So you have come back at last. I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time."""
farmer-and-badger,9,"The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray. The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him, and asked at once for the soup. Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back to his natural form and cried out:

""You wife-eating old man! Look out for the bones in the kitchen!"""
farmer-and-badger,10,"Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills. The old man was left behind alone. He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard. Then when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away. After a while he came round and burst into tears. He cried loudly and bitterly. He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief. It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, knowing nothing of what was going on at home, and congratulating himself on having once for all got rid of the wicked animal who had so often spoiled his fields. And oh! the horrible thought; he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman. ""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!"" he wailed aloud. Now, not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind, good-natured old rabbit. He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter, and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. The old man told him all that had happened. When the rabbit heard the story he was very angry at the wicked and deceitful badger, and told the old man to leave everything to him and he would avenge his wife's death. The farmer was at last comforted, and, wiping away his tears, thanked the rabbit for his goodness in coming to him in his distress."
farmer-and-badger,11,"The rabbit, seeing that the farmer was growing calmer, went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger.

The next day the weather was fine, and the rabbit went out to find the badger. He was not to be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere, so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there, for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmer's house, for fear of the old man's wrath.

The rabbit called out:

""Why are you not out on such a beautiful day? Come out with me, and we will go and cut grass on the hills together."""
farmer-and-badger,12,"The badger, never doubting but that the rabbit was his friend, willingly consented to go out with him, only too glad to get away from the neighborhood of the farmer and the fear of meeting him. The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes, out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet. They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home, to store it up for their winter's food. When they had each cut down all they wanted they tied it in bundles and then started homewards, each carrying his bundle of grass on his back. This time the rabbit made the badger go first."
farmer-and-badger,13,"When they had gone a little way the rabbit took out a flint and steel, and, striking it over the badger's back as he stepped along in front, set his bundle of grass on fire. The badger heard the flint striking, and asked:

""What is that noise. 'Crack, crack'?""

""Oh, that is nothing."" replied the rabbit; ""I only said 'Crack, crack' because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain.""

The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger's back. The badger, hearing the crackle of the burning grass, asked, ""What is that?""

""Now we have come to the 'Burning Mountain,'"" answered the rabbit."
farmer-and-badger,14,"By this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badger's back. He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass. Screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole. The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed groaning with pain.

""What an unlucky fellow you are!"" said the rabbit. ""I can't imagine how this happened! I will bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly!"""
farmer-and-badger,15,"The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun. He hoped that the badger would die of his burns, for he felt that nothing could be too bad for the animal, who was guilty of murdering a poor helpless old woman who had trusted him. He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together."
farmer-and-badger,16,"He carried this to the badger, but before putting it on he told him that it would cause him great pain, but that he must bear it patiently, because it was a very wonderful medicine for burns and scalds and such wounds. The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once. But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted all over his sore back. He rolled over and over and howled loudly. The rabbit, looking on, felt that the farmer's wife was beginning to be avenged.

The badger was in bed for about a month; but at last, in spite of the red pepper application, his burns healed and he got well. When the rabbit saw that the badger was getting well, he thought of another plan by which he could compass the creature's death. So he went one day to pay the badger a visit and to congratulate him on his recovery."
farmer-and-badger,17,"During the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing, and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth.

The badger listened with pleasure to the rabbit's account of the way he passed his time now, and forgot all his pains and his month's illness, and thought what fun it would be if he could go fishing too; so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish. This was just what the rabbit wanted, so he agreed."
farmer-and-badger,18,"Then he went home and built two boats, one of wood and the other of clay. At last they were both finished, and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded, and he could manage to kill the wicked badger now."
farmer-and-badger,19,"The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing. He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat. The badger, who knew nothing about boats, was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. They both got into their boats and set out. After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest. The badger fell in with the proposal, and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. In the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces, for the water now began to soften the clay. He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. But the rabbit answered that he was avenging the old woman's murder, and that this had been his intention all along, and that he was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all his evil crimes, and was to drown with no one to help him. Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more."
farmer-and-badger,20,"Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer. The rabbit now turned and rowed shorewards, and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach, hurried back to tell the old farmer everything, and how the badger, his enemy, had been killed.

The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. He said that till now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime, thinking of how his wife's death was unavenged, but from this time he would be able to sleep and eat as of old. He begged the rabbit to stay with him and share his home, so from this day the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer and they both lived together as good friends to the end of their days."
farquhar-macneill,1,"Once upon a time there was a young man named Farquhar MacNeill. He had
just gone to a new situation. The very first night after he went to
it his mistress asked him if he would go over the hill to the house of a
neighbour and borrow a sieve. Her own was all in holes. She
wanted to sift some meal.

Farquhar agreed to do so. He was a willing lad. He set out at
once upon his errand, after the farmer's wife had pointed out to him the
path that he was to follow. She told him that he would have no
difficulty in finding the house, even though it was strange to him. He would be sure to see the light in the window.

He had not gone very far.However, before he saw what he took to be the
light from a cottage window on his left hand, some distance from the
path, and, forgetting his Mistress's instructions that he was to follow
the path right over the hill. He left it, and walked towards the light."
farquhar-macneill,2,"It seemed to him that he had almost reached it when his foot tripped. He fell down, down, down, into a Fairy Parlour, far under the ground.

It was full of Fairies, who were engaged in different occupations.

Close by the door, or rather the hole down which he had so
unceremoniously tumbled, two little elderly women, in black aprons and
white mutches, were busily engaged in grinding corn between two flat
millstones. Other two Fairies, younger women, in blue print gowns and
white kerchiefs, were gathering up the freshly ground meal. They were baking
it into bannocks, which they were toasting on a girdle over a peat fire. It was burning slowly in a corner."
farquhar-macneill,3,"In the centre of the large apartment a great troop of Fairies, Elves,
and Sprites were dancing reels as hard as they could to the music of a
tiny set of bagpipes. They were being played by a brown-faced Gnome, who
sat on a ledge of rock far above their heads.

They all stopped their various employments when Farquhar came suddenly
down in their midst. They looked at him in alarm. When they saw that
he was not hurt, they bowed gravely and bade him be seated. Then they
went on with their work and with their play as if nothing had happened.

But Farquhar, being very fond of dancing, and being in no wise anxious
to be seated, thought that he would like to have a reel first. He
asked the Fairies if he might join them. And they, although they looked
surprised at his request, allowed him to do so. In a few minutes
the young man was dancing away as gaily as any of them."
farquhar-macneill,4,"And as he danced a strange change came over him. He forgot his errand,
he forgot his home, and he forgot everything that had ever happened to him.
He only knew that he wanted to remain with the Fairies all the rest of
his life.

And he did remain with them. A magic spell had been cast over him,
and he became like one of themselves. He could come and go at nights
without being seen. He could sip the dew from the grass and honey from
the flowers as daintily and noiselessly as if he had been a Fairy born.

Time passed by, and one night he and a band of merry companions set out
for a long journey through the air. They started early. They
intended to pay a visit to the Man in the Moon and be back again before
cock-crow."
farquhar-macneill,5,"All would have gone well if Farquhar had only looked where he was going. He did not, being deeply engaged in making love to a young Fairy
Maiden by his side, so he never saw a cottage that was standing right in
his way. He struck against the chimney and stuck fast in the
thatch.

His companions sped merrily on, not noticing what had befallen him. He was left to disentangle himself as best he could.

As he was doing so he chanced to glance down the wide chimney. In
the cottage kitchen he saw a comely young woman dandling a rosy-cheeked
baby."
farquhar-macneill,6,"Now, when Farquhar had been in his mortal state, he had been very fond
of children. A word of blessing rose to his lips.

""God shield you,"" he said, as he looked at the mother and child, little
guessing what the result of his words would be.

For scarce had the Holy Name crossed his lips than the spell which had
held him so long was broken. He became as he had been before.

Instantly his thoughts flew to his friends at home, and to the new
Mistress whom he had left waiting for her sieve. He felt sure that
some weeks must have elapsed since he set out to fetch it. So he made
haste to go to the farm."
farquhar-macneill,7,"When he arrived in the neighbourhood everything seemed strange. There
were woods where no woods used to be, and walls where no walls used to
be. To his amazement, he could not find his way to the farm. Worst
of all, in the place where he expected to find his father's house he
found nothing but a crop of rank green nettles.

In great distress he looked about for someone to tell him what it all
meant. At last he found an old man thatching the roof of a cottage.

This old man was so thin and grey that at first Farquhar took him for a
patch of mist. As he went nearer he saw that he was a human being,
and, going close up to the wall and shouting with all his might. He
felt sure that such an ancient man would be deaf. He asked him if he
could tell him where his friends had gone to, and what had happened to
his father's dwelling."
farquhar-macneill,8,"The old man listened, then he shook his head. ""I never heard of him,"" he
answered slowly; ""but perhaps my father might be able to tell you.""

""Your father!"" said Farquhar, in great surprise. ""Is it possible that
your father is alive?""

""Aye he is,"" answered the old man, with a little laugh. ""If you go into
the house you'll find him sitting in the arm-chair by the fire."""
farquhar-macneill,9,"Farquhar did as he was bid. On entering the cottage, he found another
old man, who was so thin and withered and bent that he looked as if he
must at least be a hundred years old. He was feebly twisting ropes to
bind the thatch on the roof.

""Can you tell me anything of my friends, or where my father's cottage is?""
asked Farquhar again. He hardly expected that this second old man would be
able to answer him.

""I cannot,"" mumbled this ancient person; ""but perhaps my father can tell
you.""

""Your father!"" exclaimed Farquhar, more astonished than ever. ""But
surely he must be dead long ago."""
farquhar-macneill,10,"The old man shook his head with a weird grimace.

""Look there,"" he said, and pointed with a twisted finger, to a leathern
purse, or sporran, which was hanging to one of the posts of a wooden
bedstead in the corner.

Farquhar approached it. He was almost frightened out of his wits by
seeing a tiny shrivelled face crowned by a red pirnie, looking over the
edge of the sporran.

""Take him out; he won't touch you,"" chuckled the old man by the fire."
farquhar-macneill,11,"So Farquhar took the little creature out carefully between his finger
and thumb. He set him on the palm of his left hand. He was so
shrivelled with age that he looked just like a mummy.

""Dost know anything of my friends, or where my father's cottage is gone
to?"" asked Farquhar. For the third time, hehardly expected to get an
answer.

""They were all dead long before I was born,"" piped out the tiny figure.
""I never saw any of them, but I have heard my father speak of them.""

""Then I must be older than you!"" cried Farquhar, in great dismay. And he
got such a shock at the thought that his bones suddenly dissolved into
dust. He fell, a heap of grey ashes, on the floor."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,1,"""Win victory and blessings, O Fionn,"" said Conan, ""and tell me who was
the man that, having only one leg, one arm, and one eye, escaped from
you in consequence of his swiftness. Who outstripped the Fenians of
Eire, and why is this proverb used, 'As Roc came to the house of
Fionn'?""

""I will tell you that,"" said Fionn. ""One day the chief of the Fenians
and I went to Teamhair Luachra. We took nothing in the chase that
same day but one fawn. When it had been cooked it was fetched to me for
the purpose of dividing it. I gave a portion of it to each of the Fenian
chiefs, and there remained none for my own share but a haunch bone.
Gobha Gaoithe, son of Ronan, presented himself, and requested me to
give him the haunch. I accordingly gave it to him. He then declared that
I gave him that portion on account of his swiftness of foot. He went
out on the plain, but he had only gone a short distance when Caoilte,
son of Ronan, his own brother, overtook him, and brought the haunch back
again to me, and we had no further dispute about the matter. We had not
been long so when we saw a huge, obnoxious, massy-boned, black,
detestable giant, having only one eye, one arm, and one leg, hop forward
towards us. He saluted us. I returned the salutation, and asked him
whence he came."""
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,2,"'I am come by the powers of the agility of my arm and
leg,' responded he, 'having heard there is not one man in the world more
liberal in bestowing gifts than you, O Fionn. Therefore, I am come to
solicit wealth and valuable gifts from you.' I replied that were all the
wealth of the world mine I would give him neither little nor much. He
then declared 'they were all liars who asserted that I never gave a
refusal to any person.' I replied that if he were a man I would not give
him a refusal. 'Well, then,' said the giant, 'let me have that haunch
you have in your hand, and I will say good-bye to the Fenians, provided
that you allow me the length of the haunch as a distance, and that I am
not seized upon until I make my first hop.' Upon hearing this I gave the
haunch into the giant's hand, and he hopped over the lofty stockades of
the town. He then made use of the utmost swiftness of his one leg to
outstrip all the rest of the Fenians. When the Fenian chiefs saw that,
they started in pursuit of the giant, while I and the band of minstrels
of the town went to the top of the dun to watch their proceedings. When
I saw that the giant had outstripped them a considerable distance, I put
on my running habiliments, and, taking no weapon but Mac an Loin in my
hand, I started after the others. I overtook the hindmost division on
Sliabh an Righ, the middle (next) division at Limerick, and the chiefs
of the Fenians at Ath Bo, which is called Ath-Luain (Athlone), and those
first in the pursuit at Rinn-an-Ruaigh, to the right-hand side of
Cruachan of Connacht, where he (the giant) was distant less than a
javelin's cast from me."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,3,"The giant passed on before me and crossed Eas
Roe (now Ballyshannon), of the son of Modhuirn, without wetting his
foot. I leaped over it after him. He then directed his course towards
the estuary of Binn-Edair, keeping the circuit of Eire to his right
hand. The giant leaped over the estuary, and it was a leap similar to
flight over the sea. I sprang after him, and having caught him by the
small of the back, laid him prostrate on the earth. 'You have dealt
unjustly by me, O Fionn,' cried the giant. 'For it was not with you I
arranged the combat, but with the Fenians.' I replied that the Fenians
were not perfect, except I myself were with them. We had not remained
long thus when Liagan Luaimneach, from Luachar Deaghaidh, came to us. He
was followed by Caoilte Mac Ronan, together with the swiftest of the
Fenians. Each of them couched his javelin, intending to drive it through
the giant and kill him in my arms, but I protected him from their
attacks. Soon after this the main body of the Fenians arrived. They
enquired what was the cause of the delay that the giant had not been
slain. 'That is bad counsel,' said the giant, 'for a better man than I
am would be slain in my eric.' We bound the giant strongly on that
occasion. Soon after Bran Beag O'Buadhchan came to invite me to a
feast, and all the Fenians of Eire, who had been present, accompanied
him to his house."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,4,"The banqueting hall had been prepared for our
reception at that time, and the giant was dragged into the middle of the
house, and was there placed in the sight of all present. They asked him
who he was. 'Roc, son of Diocan, is my name,' replied he, 'that is, I am
son to the Legislator of Aengus of the Brugh in the south. My betrothed
poured a current of surprising affection and a torrent of deep love upon
Sgiath Breac, son of Dathcaoin yonder, who is your foster son, O Fionn.
It hurt my feelings severely to hear her boast of the swiftness and
bravery of her lover in particular, and of the Fenians in general, and I
declared that I would challenge him and all the Fenians of Eire to run a
race with me. She sneered at me. I then went to my beloved friend,
Aengus of the Brugh, to bemoan my fate. He metamorphosed me thus,
and bestowed on me the swiftness of a druidical wind, as you have seen.
This is my history for you, and you ought to be well satisfied with all
the hurt and injury you have inflicted upon me already.'

""Then I repented me of the indignity put upon the giant, and I released
him from his bonds and I bade Liagan Luaimneach companion him to the
presence of his betrothed one and testify to her on my behalf of his
prowess in the race, wherein he had outstripped all the Fenians of Eire,
save only myself. So the two went forth together in friendly amity, and
Roc, for the champion feat reported of him by Liagan Luaimneach,
recovered the affection of his betrothed, and straightway took her to
wife. From that adventure, indeed, arose the proverb, 'As Roc came to
the House of Fionn,' and so that is the answer to your question, O
Conan,"" said Fionn."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,5,"""Win victory and blessings, O Fenian King,"" said Conan; ""it is with
clear memory and sweet words you relate these things. Tell me now the
meaning of the byword, 'The hospitality of Fionn in the house of
Cuanna.'""

""I will tell you the truth concerning that, O Conan,"" said Fionn.
""Oisin, Caoilte, Mac Lughaidh, Diarmuid O'Duibhne, and myself happened
one day, above all other days, to be on the summit of Cairn Feargall. We
were accompanied by our five hounds, namely, Bran, Sceoluing, Sear Dubh,
Luath Luachar, and Anuaill. We had not long been there when we perceived
a rough, tall, huge giant approaching us. He carried an iron fork upon
his back, and a grunting hog was placed between the prongs of the fork;
a young girl of mature age followed and forced the giant on his way
before her. 'Let someone go forward and accost those people,' said I.
Diarmuid O'Duibhne followed, but did not overtake them. The other three
and I started up, and followed Diarmuid and the giant. We overtook
Diarmuid, but did not come up with the giant or the girl; for a dark,
gloomy, druidical mist showered down between us and them, so that we
could not discern what road they took. When the mist cleared away we
looked around us, and discovered a light-roofed, comfortable-looking
house at the edge of the ford near at hand. We proceeded to the house,
before which spread a lawn upon which were two fountains. At the brink
of one fountain lay a rude iron vessel, and a vessel of bronze at the
brink of the other. Those we met in the house were an aged, hoary-headed
man standing by the door jamb to the right hand, and a beautiful maid
sitting before him; a rough, rude, huge giant before the fire busily
cooking a hog; and an old man at the other side of the fire, having an
iron-grey head of hair and twelve eyes in his head, while the twelve
sons (germs) of discord beamed in each eye."""
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,6,"There was also in the house
a ram with a white belly, a jet-black head, dark-green horns, and green
feet; and there was in the end of the house a hag covered with a dark
ash-coloured garment. There were no persons in the house except these.
The man at the door-post welcomed us; and we five, having our five
hounds with us, sat on the floor of the bruighean. 'Let submissive
homage be done to Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his people,' said the man at
the door-post. 'My case is that of a man begging a request, but
obtaining neither the smaller nor the greater part of it,' said the
giant. Nevertheless, he rose up and did respectful homage to us. After a
while I became suddenly thirsty, and no person present perceived it but
Caoilte, who began to complain bitterly on that account. 'You have no
cause to complain, Caoilte,' said the man of the door-post, 'but only to
step outside and fetch a drink for Fionn from whichever of the fountains
you please.' Caoilte did so, and fetched the bronze vessel brimful to me
and gave me to drink. I took a drink from it, and the water tasted like
honey while I was drinking, but bitter as gall when I put the vessel
from my lips; so that darting pains and symptoms of death seized me and
agonising pangs from the poisonous draught. I could be but with
difficulty recognised; and the lamentation of Caoilte on account of my
being in that condition was greater than that he had before given vent
to on account of my thirst. The man at the door-post desired Caoilte to
go out and bring me a drink from the other fountain. Caoilte obeyed,
and brought me the iron vessel brimful. I never underwent so much
hardship in battle or conflict as I then suffered while drinking, in
consequence of the bitterness of the draught; but as soon as I put the
vessel from my lips I recovered my own colour and appearance, and that
gave joy and happiness to my people."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,7,"The man then asked if the hog which was in the boiler was yet cooked.
'It is cooked,' replied the giant, 'and allow me to divide it.' 'How
will you divide it?' said the man of the house. 'I will give one
hindquarter to Fionn and his hounds; the other hindquarter to Fionn's
four men; the forepart to myself; the chine and rump to the old man who
sits at the opposite side of the fire and to the hag in yonder corner;
and the giblets to you and the young woman who is opposite to you.' 'I
pledge my word,' said the man of the house, 'you have divided it very
fairly.' 'I pledge my word,' exclaimed the ram, 'that the division is
very unfair so far as I am concerned, for I have been altogether
forgotten.' And so saying, he immediately snatched the quarter that lay
before my four men, and carried it away into a corner, where he began to
devour it. The four men instantly attacked the ram all at once with
their swords, but though they laid on violently, it did not affect him
in the least, and the blows fell away as from a stone or rock, so that
they were forced to resume their seats. 'Upon my veracity, he is doomed
for evil who owns as companions such four fellows as you are, who tamely
suffer one single sheep to carry away your food and devour it before
your faces,' exclaimed the man with the twelve eyes; and at the same
time going up to the ram, he caught him by the feet and gave him a
violent pitch out of the door, so that he fell on his back on the
ground; and from that time we saw him no more. Soon after this the hag
started up, and having thrown her ashy-grey coverlet over my four men,
metamorphosed them into four withered, drooping-headed old men. When I
saw that I was seized with great fear and alarm; and when the man at the
door-post perceived this, he desired me to come over to him, place my
head on his bosom, and sleep. I did so; and the hag got up and took her
coverlet off my four men; and when I awoke I found them restored to
their own shape, and that was a great happiness to me."
festivities-at-the-house-of-conan,8,"'O Fionn,' asked
the man of the door-post, 'do you feel surprised at the appearance and
arrangements of this house?' I assured him that I never saw anything
which surprised me more. 'Well, then, I will explain the meaning of all
these things to you,' said the man. 'The giant carrying the grunting hog
between the prongs of the iron fork, whom you first saw, is he who is
yonder, and his name is SLOTH. She who is close to me is the young woman
who had been forcing him along, that is ENERGY; and ENERGY compels SLOTH
forward with her; for ENERGY moves, in the twinkling of the eye, a
greater distance than the foot can travel in a year. The old man of the
bright eyes yonder signifies the WORLD; and he is more powerful than
anyone, which has been proved by his rendering the ram powerless. That
ram which you saw signifies the CRIMES of the man. That hag there beyond
is withering OLD AGE, and her clothing has withered your four men. The
two wells from which you drank the two draughts mean FALSEHOOD and
TRUTH; for while telling a lie one finds it sweet, but it becomes bitter
at the last. Cuanna from Innistuil is my own name. I do not reside here,
but having conceived a wonderful love for you, O Fionn, on account of
your superiority in wisdom and general celebrity, I therefore put those
things into the way before you in order that I might see you. And this
story shall be called, to the end of the world, the Hospitality of
Cuanna's House to Fionn. Let you and your men come together, and do ye
five sleep until morning.' Accordingly we did so, and when we awoke in
the morning we found ourselves on the summit of Cairn Feargaill, with
our hounds and arms by us. So there is the meaning of the byword, 'The
hospitality of Fionn in the house of Cuanna,' O Conan, said Fionn."
flax,1,"THE flax was in full bloom. It had pretty little blue flowers, as delicate as the wings of a moth. The sun shone on it and the showers watered it. This was as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mothers. They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax. ""People say that I look exceedingly well,"" said the flax, ""and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate I am! It makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me. How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain! My happiness overpowers me! No one in the world can feel happier than I."""
flax,2,"""Ah, yes, no doubt,"" said the fern, ""but you do not know the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty""; and then it sang quite mournfully:
          ""Snip, snap, snurre,
           Basse lurre.
           The song is ended.""
""No, it is not ended,"" said the flax. ""To-morrow the sun will shine or the rain descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel that I am in full blossom. I am the happiest of all creatures, for I may some day come to something."""
flax,3,"Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots, which was very painful. Then it was laid in water, as if it were to be drowned, and after that placed near a fire, as if it were to be roasted. All this was very shocking. ""We cannot expect to be happy always,"" said the flax. ""By experiencing evil as well as good we become wise."" And certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed. Indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel. ""Whir, whir,"" went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts. ""Well, I have been very happy,"" it thought in the midst of its pain, ""and must be contented with the past."" And contented it remained, till it was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax, even to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece."
flax,4,"""Well, this is quite wonderful,"" said the flax. ""I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune. The fern was not wrong when it sang, 
        'Snip, snap, snurre,
          Basse lurre.' 
But the song is not ended yet, I am sure. It is only just beginning. How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last! I am the luckiest person in the world--so strong and fine. And how white and long I am! This is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Then I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained. Now I am watched and cared for. Every morning the maid turns me over, and I have a shower bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes, and the clergyman's wife noticed me and said I was the best piece of linen in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am now."""
flax,5,"After some time the linen was taken into the house, and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears. ""See now, then,"" said the flax, ""I have become something of importance. This was my destiny. It is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every one ought to be. It is the only way to be happy. I am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same. It is most extraordinary good fortune."""
flax,6,"Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. ""It must end very soon,"" said the pieces to each other. ""We would gladly have held together a little longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities."" And at length they fell into rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper. ""Well, now, this is a surprise--a glorious surprise too,"" said the paper. ""Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell what fine things I may have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!"" And so it was, for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was remarkable good fortune. Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them wiser and better; for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing was contained in it."
flax,7,"""I never imagined anything like this when I was only a little blue flower growing in the fields,"" said the paper. ""How could I know that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to men? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself but what I was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I think that the song is ended, and then something higher and better begins for me. I suppose now I shall be sent out to journey about the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise, for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier than ever."""
flax,8,"But the paper did not go on its travels. It was sent to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type to make a book,--or rather many hundreds of books,--for many more persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent about the world, it would have been worn out before it had half finished its journey."
flax,9,"""Yes, this is certainly the wisest plan,"" said the written paper; ""I really did not think of this. I shall remain at home and be held in honor like some old grandfather, as I really am to all these new books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered about as they can, yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most honored of all."" Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse. ""After work, it is well to rest,"" said the paper, ""and a very good opportunity to collect one's thoughts. Now I am able, for the first time, to learn what is in me; and to know one's self is true progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No doubt I shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto, I know quite well."""
flax,10,"Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned. People said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it had been written upon. The children in the house stood round the hearth to watch the blaze, for paper always flamed up so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, there were so many red sparks to be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the wind. They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster. They would often think the last spark had come, and one would cry, ""There goes the schoolmaster,"" but the next moment another spark would appear, bright and beautiful. How they wanted to know where all the sparks went to! Perhaps they will find out some day."
flax,11,"The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was soon burning. ""Ugh!"" cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; ""ugh!"" It was certainly not very pleasant to be burned. But when the whole was wrapped in flames, the sparks mounted up into the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little blue flowers, and they glistened as the white linen never could have glistened. All the written letters became quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire."
flax,12,"""Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,"" said a voice in the flames; and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words as the flames darted up through the chimney and went out at the top. Then a number of tiny beings, as many as the flowers on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above the children. They were even lighter and more delicate than the blue flowers from which they were born; and as the flames died out and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it, and wherever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared."
flax,13,"""The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster was the last of all,"" said the children. It was good fun, and they sang over the dead ashes:
          ""Snip, snap, snurre,
           Basse lurre.
           The song is ended.""
But the little invisible beings said, ""The song is never ended; the most beautiful is yet to come."" But the children could neither hear nor understand this; nor should they, for children must not know everything."
fox-fire,1,"Once upon a time there was a strong young farmer who came home late
one evening from market. His way led him past the gardens of a wealthy
gentleman, in which stood a number of tall buildings. Suddenly he saw
something shining floating in the air inside the gardens, something
which glowed like a ball of crystal. He was astonished, and climbed
the wall around the gardens, but there was not a human being in sight;
all he saw was, at a distance, something which appeared to be a dog,
looking up at the moon. And whenever it blew its breath out a ball of
fire came out of its mouth, and rose to the moon. And whenever it drew
its breath in the ball sank down again, and it caught it in its jaws.
And so it went on without a stop."
fox-fire,2,"Then the farmer realized that it was
a fox, who was preparing the elixir of life. He hid in the grass and
waited until the ball of fire came down again, at about the height of
his own head. Then he stepped hastily from his hiding-place, took it
away and at once swallowed it. And he could feel it glow as it passed
down his throat into his stomach. When the fox saw what had happened
he grew angry. He looked furiously at the farmer, but feared his
strength. For this reason he did not dare attack him, but went angrily
on his way."
fox-fire,3,"From that time on the farmer-boy could make himself invisible, was
able to see ghosts and devils, and had intercourse with the
spirit-world. In cases of sickness, when people lay unconscious, he
could call back their souls, and if some one had committed a sin he
could plead for them. He earned much money owing to these gifts."
fox-fire,4,"When he reached his fiftieth year, he withdrew from all things and
would no longer exercise his arts. One summer evening he was sitting
in his courtyard, enjoying the cool air. While there he drank a number
of goblets of wine, and by midnight had fallen fast asleep. Suddenly
he awoke, feeling ill. It seemed as though some one were patting him
on the back, and before he knew it, the ball of fire had leaped out
from his throat."
fox-fire,5,"At once a hand reached for it and a voice said: ""For
thirty long years you kept my treasure from me, and from a poor
farmer-lad you have grown to be a wealthy man. Now you have enough,
and I would like to have my fire-ball back again!""

Then the man knew what had happened, but the fox was gone."
giauna-the-beautiful,1,"Once upon a time there was a descendant of Confucius. His father had a
friend, and this friend held an official position in the South and
offered the young man a place as secretary. But when the latter
reached the town where he was to have been active, he found that his
father's friend had already died. Then he was much embarrassed, seeing
that he did not have the means to return home again. So he was glad to
take refuge in the Monastery of Puto, where he copied holy books for
the abbot."
giauna-the-beautiful,2,"About a hundred paces west of the monastery stood a deserted house.
One day there had been a great snowfall, and as young Kung
accidentally passed by the door of the house, he noticed a well
dressed and prepossessing youth standing there who bowed to him and
begged him to approach. Now young Kung was a scholar, and could
appreciate good manners. Finding that the youth and himself had much
in common, he took a liking to him, and followed him into the house.
It was immaculately clean; silk curtains hung before the doors, and on
the walls were pictures of good old masters. On a table lay a book
entitled: ""Tales of the Coral Ring."" Coral Ring was the name of a
cavern."
giauna-the-beautiful,3,"Once upon a time there lived a monk at Puto who was exceedingly
learned. An aged man had led him into the cave in question, where he
had seen a number of volumes on the book stands. The aged man had
said: ""These are the histories of the various dynasties."" In a second
room were to be found the histories of all the peoples on earth. A
third was guarded by two dogs. The aged man explained: ""In this room
are kept the secret reports of the immortals, telling the arts by
means of which they gained eternal life. The two dogs are two
dragons."" The monk turned the pages of the books, and found that they
were all works of ancient times, such as he had never seen before. He
would gladly have remained in the cave, but the old man said: ""That
would not do!"" and a boy led him out again. The name of that cave,
however, was the Coral Ring, and it was described in the volume which
lay on the table."
giauna-the-beautiful,4,"The youth questioned Kung regarding his name and family, and the
latter told him his whole history. The youth pitied him greatly and
advised him to open a school.

Kung answered with a sigh: ""I am quite unknown in the neighborhood,
and have no one to recommend me!""

Said the youth: ""If you do not consider me altogether too unworthy and
stupid, I should like to be your pupil myself."""
giauna-the-beautiful,5,"Young Kung was overjoyed. ""I should not dare to attempt to teach you,""
he replied, ""but together we might dedicate ourselves to the study of
science."" He then asked why the house had been standing empty for so
long.

The youth answered: ""The owner of the house has gone to the country.
We come from Shensi, and have taken the house for a short time. We
only moved in a few days ago.""

They chatted and joked together gaily, and the young man invited Kung
to remain overnight, ordering a small boy to light a pan of charcoal."
giauna-the-beautiful,6,"Then he stepped rapidly into the rear room and soon returned saying:
""My father has come.""

As Kung rose an aged man with a long, white beard and eyebrows stepped
into the room and said, greeting him: ""You have already declared your
willingness to instruct my son, and I am grateful for your kindness.
But you must be strict with him and not treat him as a friend."""
giauna-the-beautiful,7,"Then he had garments of silk, a fur cap, and shoes and socks of fur
brought in, and begged Kung to change his clothes. Wine and food were
then served. The cushions and covers of the tables and chairs were
made of stuffs unknown to Kung, and their shimmering radiance blinded
the eye. The aged man retired after a few beakers of wine, and then
the youth showed Kung his essays. They were all written in the style
of the old masters and not in the new-fangled eight-section form."
giauna-the-beautiful,8,"When he was asked about this, the youth said with a smile: ""I am quite
indifferent to winning success at the state examinations!"" Then he
turned to the small boy and said: ""See whether the old gentleman has
already fallen asleep. If he has, you may quietly bring in little
Hiang-Nu."""
giauna-the-beautiful,9,"The boy went off, and the youth took a lute from an embroidered case.
At once a serving-maid entered, dressed in red, and surpassingly
beautiful. The youth bade her sing ""The Lament of the Beloved,"" and
her melting tones moved the heart. The third watch of the night had
passed before they retired to sleep."
giauna-the-beautiful,10,"On the following morning all rose early and study began. The youth was
exceptionally gifted. Whatever he had seen but once was graven in his
memory. Hence he made surprising progress in the course of a few
months. The old custom was followed of writing an essay every five
days, and celebrating its completion with a little banquet. And at
each banquet Hiang-Nu was sent for."
giauna-the-beautiful,11,"One evening Kung could not remove his glance from Hiang-Nu. The youth
guessed his thoughts and said to him: ""You are as yet unmarried. Early
and late I keep thinking as to how I can provide you with a charming
life companion. Hiang-Nu is the serving-maid of my father, so I cannot
give her to you.""

Said Kung: ""I am grateful to you for your friendly thought. But if the
girl you have in mind is not just as beautiful as Hiang-Nu, then I
would rather do without.""

The youth laughed: ""You are indeed inexperienced if you think that
Hiang-Nu is beautiful. Your wish is easily fulfilled."""
giauna-the-beautiful,12,"Thus half a year went by and the monotonous rainy season had just
began. Then a swelling the size of a peach developed in young Kung's
breast, which increased over night until it was as large as a tea-cup.
He lay on his couch groaning with pain, and unable to eat or to sleep.
The youth was busy day and night nursing him, and even the old
gentleman asked how he was getting along."
giauna-the-beautiful,13,"Then the youth said: ""My little sister Giauna alone is able to cure
this illness. Please send to grandmother, and have her brought here!""

The old gentleman was willing, and he sent off his boy.

The next day the boy came back with the news that Giauna would come,
together with her aunt and her cousin A-Sung."
giauna-the-beautiful,14,"Not long after the youth led his sister into the room. She was not
more than thirteen or fourteen years of age, enchantingly beautiful,
and slender as a willow-tree. When the sick man saw her he forgot all
his pain and his spirits rose.

The youth said to his sister Giauna: ""This is my best friend, whom I
love as a brother! I beg of you, little sister, to cure him of his
illness!"""
giauna-the-beautiful,15,"The maiden blushed with confusion; then she stepped up to the
sick-bed. While she was feeling his pulse, it seemed to him as though
she brought the fragrance of orchards with her.

Said the maiden with a smile: ""No wonder that this illness has
befallen him. His heart beats far too stormily. His illness is serious
but not incurable. Now the blood which has flowed has already
gathered, so we will have to cut to cure."""
giauna-the-beautiful,16,"With that she took her golden armlet from her arm and laid it on the
aching place. She pressed it down very gently, and the swelling rose a
full inch above the armlet so that it enclosed the entire swelling.
Then she loosed a pen-knife with a blade as thin as paper from her
silken girdle. With one hand she held the armlet, and with the other
she took the knife and lightly passed it around the bottom of the
ring. Black blood gushed forth and ran over mattress and bed. But
young Kung was so enchanted by the presence of the beautiful Giauna
that not only did he feel no pain, but his one fear was that the whole
affair might end too soon, and that she would disappear from his
sight."
giauna-the-beautiful,17,"In a moment the diseased flesh had been cut away, and Giauna
had fresh water brought and cleansed the wound. Then she took a small
red pellet from her mouth, and laid it on the wound, and when she
turned around in a circle, it seemed to Kung as though she drew out
all the inflammation in steam and flames. Once more she turned in a
circle, and he felt his wound itch and quiver, and when she turned for
the third time, he was completely cured."
giauna-the-beautiful,18,"The maiden took the pellet into her mouth again and said: ""Now all is
well!"" Then she hastened into the inner room. Young Kung leaped up in
order to thank her.

True, he was now cured of his illness, but his thoughts continued to
dwell on Giauna's pretty face. He neglected his books and sat lost in
day-dreams.

His friend had noticed it and said to him: ""I have at last succeeded,
this very day, in finding an attractive life companion for you."""
giauna-the-beautiful,19,"Kung asked who she might be.

""The daughter of my aunt, A-Sung. She is seventeen years of age, and
anything but homely.""

""I am sure she is not as beautiful as Giauna,"" thought Kung. Then he
hummed the lines of a song to himself:

    ""Who once has seen the sea close by,
      All rivers shallow streams declares;
    Who o'er Wu's hill the clouds watched fly,
      Says nothing with that view compares."""
giauna-the-beautiful,20,"The youth smiled. ""My little sister Giauna is still very young,"" said
he. ""Besides, she is my father's only daughter, and he would not like
to see her marry some one from afar. But my cousin A-Sung is not
homely either. If you do not believe me, wait until they go walking in
the garden, and then you may take a look at them without their knowing
it."""
giauna-the-beautiful,21,"Kung posted himself at the open window on the look-out, and sure
enough, he saw Giauna come along leading another girl by the hand, a
girl so beautiful that there was none other like her. Giauna and she
seemed to be sisters, only to be told apart by a slight difference in
age."
giauna-the-beautiful,22,"Then young Kung was exceedingly happy and begged his friend to act for
him in arranging the marriage, which the latter promised to do. The
next day he came to Kung, and told him amid congratulations that
everything was arranged. A special court was put in order for the
young pair, and the wedding was celebrated. Young Kung felt as though
he had married a fairy, and the two became very fond of each other."
giauna-the-beautiful,23,"One day Kung's friend came to him in a state of great excitement and
said: ""The owner of this house is coming back, and my father now
wishes to return to Shensi. The time for us to part draws near, and I
am very sad!""

Kung wished to accompany them, but his friend advised him to return to
his own home.

Kung mentioned the difficulties in the way, but the youth replied:
""That need not worry you, because I will accompany you."""
giauna-the-beautiful,24,"After a time the father came, together with A-Sung, and made Kung a
present of a hundred ounces of gold. Then the youth took Kung and his
wife by the hand, and told them to close their eyes. As soon as they
did so off they went through the air like a storm-wind. All Kung could
notice was that the gale roared about his ears.

When some time had passed the youth cried: ""Now we have arrived!"" Kung
opened his eyes and saw his old home, and then he knew that his friend
was not of human kind."
giauna-the-beautiful,25,"Gaily they knocked at the door of his home. His mother opened it and
when she saw that he had brought along so charming a wife she was
greatly pleased. Then Kung turned around to his friend, but the latter
had already disappeared.

A-Sung served her mother-in-law with great devotion, and her beauty
and virtue was celebrated far and near. Soon after young Kung gained
the doctorate, and was appointed inspector of prisons in Shensi. He
took his wife along with him, but his mother remained at home, since
Shensi was too far for her to travel. And heaven gave A-Sung and Kung
a little son."
giauna-the-beautiful,26,"But Kung became involved in a dispute with a traveling censor. The
latter complained about Kung and he was dismissed from his post.

So it happened that one day he was idling about before the city, when
he saw a handsome youth riding a black mule. When he looked more
closely he saw that it was his old friend. They fell into each others'
arms, laughing and weeping, and the youth led him to a village. In the
midst of a thick grove of trees which threw a deep shade, stood a
house whose upper stories rose to the skies. One could see at a glance
that people of distinction lived there. Kung now inquired after sister
Giauna, and was told that she had married. He remained over night and
then went off to fetch his wife."
giauna-the-beautiful,27,"In the meantime Giauna arrived. She took A-Sung's little son in her
arms and said: ""Cousin, this is a little stranger in our family!""

Kung greeted her, and again thanked her for the kindness she had shown
him in curing his illness.

She answered with a smile: ""Since then you have become a distinguished
man, and the wound has long since healed. Have you still not forgotten
your pain?"""
giauna-the-beautiful,28,"Then Giauna's husband arrived, and every one became acquainted. And
after that they parted.

One day the youth came sadly to Kung and said: ""We are threatened by a
great misfortune to-day. I do not know whether you would be willing to
save us!""

Kung did not know what it might be; but he gladly promised his aid.
Then the youth called up the entire family and they bowed down in the
outer court."
giauna-the-beautiful,29,"He began: ""I will tell you the truth just as it is. We are foxes. This
day we are threatened by the danger of thunder. If you care to save
us, then there is a hope that we may manage to stay alive; if not,
then take your child and go, so that you are not involved in our
danger.""

But Kung vowed that he would share life and death with them.

Then the youth begged him to stand in the door with a sword in his
hand, and said: ""Now when the thunder begins to roll you must stand
there and never stir."""
giauna-the-beautiful,30,"Suddenly dark clouds rose in the sky, and the heavens grew gloomy as
if night were closing down. Kung looked about him, but the buildings
had all disappeared, and behind him he could only see a high barrow,
in which was a large cave whose interior was lost in darkness. In the
midst of his fright he was surprised by a thunderbolt. A heavy rain
poured down in streams, and a storm wind arose which rooted up the
tallest trees. Everything glimmered before his eyes and his ears were
deafened. But he held his sword in his hand, and stood as firm as a
rock."
giauna-the-beautiful,31,"Suddenly in the midst of black smoke and flashes of lightning,
he saw a monster with a pointed beak and long claws, which was
carrying off a human body. When he looked more closely he recognized
by the dress that it was Giauna. He leaped up at the monster and
struck at him with his sword, and at once Giauna fell to the ground.
A tremendous crash of thunder shook the earth, and Kung fell down
dead."
giauna-the-beautiful,32,"Then the tempest cleared away, and the blue sky appeared once more.

Giauna had regained consciousness, and when she saw Kung lying dead
beside her she said amid sobs: ""He died for my sake! Why should I
continue to live?"""
giauna-the-beautiful,33,"A-Sung also came out, and together they carried him into the cave.
Giauna told A-Sung to hold his head while her brother opened his
mouth. She herself took hold of his chin, and brought out her little
red pellet. She pressed it against his lips with her own, and breathed
into his lungs. Then the breath came back to his throat with a
rattling noise, and in a short time he was himself once more."
giauna-the-beautiful,34,"So there was the whole family reunited again, and none of its members
had come to harm. They gradually recovered from their fright, and were
quite happy: when suddenly a small boy brought the news that Giauna's
husband and his whole family had been killed by the thunder. Giauna
broke down, weeping, and the others tried to comfort her."
giauna-the-beautiful,35,"Finally Kung said: ""It is not well to dwell too long amid the graves
of the dead. Will you not come home with me?""

Thereupon they packed up their belongings and went with him. He
assigned a deserted garden, which he carefully walled off, to his
friend and his family as a dwelling-place. Only when Kung and A-Sung
came to visit them was the bolt drawn. Then Giauna and her brother
played chess, drank tea and chatted with them like members of the same
family."
giauna-the-beautiful,36,"But Kung's little son had a somewhat pointed face, which resembled a
fox's, and when he went along the street, the people would turn
around and say: ""There goes the fox-child!"""
girl-and-snake,1,"Once upon a time there was a girl who was to go to the wood and drive the cattle home; but she did not find the herd, and losing her way instead, came to a great hill. It had gates and doors and she went in. There stood a table covered with all sorts of good things to eat. And there stood a bed as well, and in the bed lay a great snake. The snake said to the girl: ""Sit down, if you choose! Eat, if you choose! Come and lie down in the bed, if you choose! But if you do not choose, then do not do so."" So the girl did nothing at all. At last the snake said: ""Some people are coming now who want you to dance with them. But do not go along with them."" Straightway people arrived who wanted to dance with the girl; but she would hear nothing of it."
girl-and-snake,2,"Then they began to eat and drink; but the girl left the hill and went home. The following day she again went to the wood to look for the cattle, did not find them, lost her way again, and came to the same hill. This time she also entered, and found everything as it had been the first time, the well-spread table and the bed with the snake in it. And the snake said to her, as before: ""Sit down, if you choose! Eat, if you choose! Come, and lie down in the bed if you choose! But if you do not choose, then do not do so! Now a great many more people are coming who will want to dance with you, but do not go with them."" The snake had scarcely concluded before a great many people arrived, who began to dance, eat and drink; but the girl did not keep them company, instead she left the hill and went home."
girl-and-snake,3,"On the third day when she once more went to the wood, everything happened exactly as on the first and second day. The snake invited her to eat and drink, and this time she did so, with a hearty appetite. Then the snake told her to lie down beside him and the girl obeyed. Then the snake said: ""Put your arm about me!"" She did so. ""And now kiss me,"" said the snake, ""but if you are afraid, put your apron between us."" The girl did so, and in a moment the snake was turned into a marvellously handsome youth, who was really a prince, bewitched in the form of a snake by magic spells, and now delivered by the girl's courage. Then both of them went away and there was nothing further heard of them."
goblin-huckster,1,"THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret and had no possessions. And there was also a regular huckster, to whom the house belonged, and who occupied the ground floor. A goblin lived with the huckster because at Christmas he always had a large dishful of jam, with a great piece of butter in the middle. The huckster could afford this, and therefore the goblin remained with him--which was very shrewd of the goblin."
goblin-huckster,2,"One evening the student came into the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself; he had no one to send, and therefore he came himself. He obtained what he wished, and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him. The huckster's wife was a woman who could do more than merely nod, for she usually had plenty to say for herself. The student nodded also, as he turned to leave, then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn out of an old book; a book that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full of poetry."
goblin-huckster,3,"""Yonder lies some more of the same sort,"" said the huckster. ""I gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it; you shall have the rest for sixpence if you will."" ""Indeed I will,"" said the student. ""Give me the book instead of the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without cheese. It would be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a clever man and a practical man, but you understand no more about poetry than that cask yonder."""
goblin-huckster,4,"This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask, but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said in fun. The goblin, however, felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter. As soon as it was night, the shop closed, and every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster's wife slept, and took away her tongue, which of course she did not then want. Whatever object in the room he placed this tongue upon, immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do. It could only be used by one object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion. The goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old newspapers."
goblin-huckster,5,"""Is it really true,"" he asked, ""that you do not know what poetry is?""
""Of course I know,"" replied the cask. ""Poetry is something that always stands in the corner of a newspaper and is sometimes cut out. And I may venture to affirm that I have more of it in me than the student has, even if I am only a poor tub of the huckster's.""
Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill, and how it did go, to be sure! Then he put it on the butter-tub, and the cash-box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the waste-paper tub. A majority must always be respected. ""Now I shall go and tell the student,"" said the goblin."
goblin-huckster,6,"With these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret, where the student lived. The student's candle was burning still, and the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book which he had bought out of the shop. But how light the room was! From the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full like the stem of a tree, from which bright rays spread upward and over the student's head. Each leaf was fresh, and each flower was like a beautiful female head--some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear. The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music. The little goblin had never imagined, much less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as this. He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out. The student no doubt had blown out his candle and gone to bed, but the little goblin remained standing there, listening to the music which still sounded, soft and beautiful--a sweet cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest."
goblin-huckster,7,"""This is a wonderful place,"" said the goblin; ""I never expected such a thing. I should like to stay here with the student."" Then the little man thought it over, for he was a sensible sprite. At last he sighed, ""But the student has no jam!"" So he went downstairs again to the huckster's shop, and it was a good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue. He had given a description of all that he contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady. From that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash-box down to the pine-wood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask. They all had such confidence in him and treated him with so much respect that when, in the evening, the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art, they fancied it must all come from the cask."
goblin-huckster,8,"After what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding downstairs. As soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him that the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole. While there, a feeling of vastness came over him, such as we experience by the ever-moving sea when the storm breaks forth, and it brought tears into his eyes. He did not himself know why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears. ""How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under such a tree!"" But that was out of the question; he must be content to look through the keyhole and be thankful for even that."
goblin-huckster,9,"There he stood on the cold landing, with the autumn wind blowing down upon him through the trapdoor. It was very cold, but the little creature did not really feel it till the light in the garret went out and the tones of music died away. Then how he shivered and crept downstairs again to his warm corner, where he felt at home and comfortable! And when Christmas came again and brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked the huckster best of all."
goblin-huckster,10,"Soon after, the goblin was waked in the middle of the night by a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and the house doors and by the sound of the watchman's horn. A great fire had broken out, and the whole street seemed full of flames. Was it in their house or a neighbor's? No one could tell, for terror had seized upon all. The huckster's wife was so bewildered that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket, that she might save something at least. The huckster ran to get his business papers, and the servant resolved to save her black silk mantle, which she had managed to buy. All wished to keep the best things they had. The goblin had the same wish, for with one spring he was upstairs in the student's room. He found him standing by the open window and looking quite calmly at the fire, which was raging in the house of a neighbor opposite."
goblin-huckster,11,"The goblin caught up the wonderful book, which lay on the table, and popped it into his red cap, which he held tightly with both hands. The greatest treasure in the house was saved, and he ran away with it to the roof and seated himself on the chimney. The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat with both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay. It was then that he understood what feelings were really strongest in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended. Yet, when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at last, ""I must divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster, because of the jam."" This is a representation of human nature. We are like the goblin; we all go to visit the huckster, ""because of the jam."""
grandmother,1,"Grandmother is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her hair is quite white; but her eyes are like two stars, and they have a mild, gentle expression in them when they look at you, which does you good. She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers worked on it; and it rustles when she moves. And then she can tell the most wonderful stories. Grandmother knows a great deal, for she was alive before father and mother--that's quite certain. She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes."
grandmother,2,"""I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way? Do you know?"" Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,--they have been left to grandmother. At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles. Grandmother cannot smile like that now. Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book."
grandmother,3,"Grandmother is dead now. She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile. We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace. It was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine. She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead. She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile. We did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who had been such a dear, good grandmother. The hymn-book, in which the rose still lay, was placed under her head, for so she had wished it; and then they buried grandmother."
grandmother,4,"On the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted a rose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat among the flowers, and sang over the grave. From the organ in the church sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were written in the old book under the head of the dead one."
grandmother,5,"The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose from the tree by the churchyard wall. The dead know more than we do who are living. They know what a terror would come upon us if such a strange thing were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person among us. They are better off than we are; the dead return no more. The earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that lies within it. The leaves of the hymn-book are dust; and the rose, with all its recollections, has crumbled to dust also. But over the grave fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young. Eyes can never die. Ours will once again behold dear grandmother, young and beautiful as when, for the first time, she kissed the fresh, red rose, that is now dust in the grave."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,1,"There were six falcons living in a nest, five of whom were still too
young to fly, when it so happened that both the parent birds were shot
in one day. The young brood waited anxiously for their return; but night
came, and they were left without parents and without food.

Gray Eagle, the eldest, and the only one whose feathers had become stout
enough to enable him to leave the nest, took his place at the head of
the family, and assumed the duty of stifling their cries and providing
the little household with food, in which he was very successful. But,
after a short time had passed, by an unlucky mischance, while out on a
foraging excursion, he got one of his wings broken."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,2,"This was the more to
be regretted, as the season had arrived when they were soon to go to a
southern country to pass the winter, and the children were only waiting
to become a little stronger and more expert on the wing to set out on
the journey.

Finding that their elder brother did not return, they resolved to go in
search of him. After beating up and down the country for the better part
of a whole day, they at last found him, sorely wounded and unable to
fly, lodged in the upper branches of a sycamore-tree."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,3,"""Brothers,"" said Gray Eagle, as soon as they were gathered around, and
questioned him as to the extent of his injuries, ""an accident has
befallen me, but let not this prevent your going to a warmer climate.
Winter is rapidly approaching, and you can not remain here. It is better
that I alone should die, than for you all to suffer on my account."""
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,4,"""No, no,"" they replied, with one voice. ""We will not forsake you. We
will share your sufferings; we will abandon our journey, and take care
of you as you did of us before we were able to take care of ourselves.
If the chill climate kills you, it shall kill us. Do you think we can so
soon forget your brotherly care, which has equaled a father's, and even
a mother's kindness? Whether you live or die, we will live or die with
you.""

They sought out a hollow tree to winter in, and contrived to carry their
wounded nest-mate thither; and before the rigor of the season had set
in, they had, by diligence and economy, stored up food enough to carry
them through the winter months."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,5,"To make the provisions they had laid in last the better, it was agreed
among them that two of their number should go south; leaving the other
three to watch over, feed, and protect their wounded brother. The
travelers set forth, sorry to leave home, but resolved that the first
promise of spring should bring them back again. At the close of day, the
three brothers who remained, mounting to the very peak of the tree, and
bearing Gray Eagle in their arms, watched them, as they vanished away
southward, till their forms blended with the air and were wholly lost to
sight."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,6,"Their next business was to set the household in order, and this, with
the judicious direction of Gray Eagle, who was propped up in a snug
fork, with soft cushions of dry moss, they speedily accomplished. One of
the sisters, for there were two of these, took upon herself the charge
of nursing Gray Eagle, preparing his food, bringing him water, and
changing his pillows when he grew tired of one position. She also looked
to it that the house itself was kept in a tidy condition, and that the
pantry was supplied with food. The second brother was assigned the duty
of physician, and he was to prescribe such herbs and other medicines as
the state of the health of Gray Eagle seemed to require."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,7,"As the second
brother had no other invalid on his visiting-list, he devoted the time
not given to the cure of his patient, to the killing of game wherewith
to stock the house-keeper's larder; so that, whatever he did, he was
always busy in the line of professional duty--killing or curing. On his
hunting excursions, Doctor Falcon carried with him his youngest brother,
who, being a foolish young fellow, and inexperienced in the ways of the
world, it was not thought safe to trust alone."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,8,"In due time, what with good nursing, and good feeding, and good air,
Gray Eagle recovered from his wound, and he repaid the kindness of his
brothers by giving them such advice and instruction in the art of
hunting as his age and experience qualified him to impart. As spring
advanced, they began to look about for the means of replenishing their
store-house, whose supplies were running low; and they were all quite
successful in their quest except the youngest, whose name was Peepi, or
the Pigeon-Hawk, and who had of late begun to set up for himself."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,9,"Being
small and foolish, and feather-headed, flying hither and yonder without
any set purpose, it so happened that Peepi always came home, so to
phrase it, with an empty game-bag, and his pinions terribly rumpled.

At last Gray Eagle spoke to him, and demanded the cause of his ill-luck.

""It is not my smallness nor weakness of body,"" Peepi answered, ""that
prevents my bringing home provender as well as my brothers. I am all the
time on the wing, hither and thither. I kill ducks and other birds every
time I go out; but just as I get to the woods, on my way home, I am met
by a large ko-ko-ho, who robs me of my prey; and,"" added Peepi, with
great energy, ""it's my settled opinion that the villain lies in wait for
the very purpose of doing so."""
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,10,"""I have no doubt you are right, Brother Peepi,"" rejoined Gray Eagle. ""I
know this pirate--his name is White Owl; and now that I feel my strength
fully recovered, I will go out with you to-morrow and help you look
after this greedy bush-ranger.""

The next day they went forth in company, and arrived at a fine
fresh-water lake. Gray Eagle seated himself hard by, while Peepi started
out, and soon pounced upon a duck."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,11,"""Well done!"" thought his brother, who saw his success; but just as
little Peepi was getting to land with his prize, up sailed a large white
owl from a tree where he, too, had been watching, and laid claim to it.
He was on the point of wresting it from Peepi, when Gray Eagle, calling
out to the intruder to desist, rushed up, and, fixing his talons in both
sides of the owl, without further introduction or ceremony, flew away
with him."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,12,"The little Pigeon-Hawk followed closely, with the duck under his wing,
rejoiced and happy to think that he had something to carry home at last.
He was naturally much vexed with the owl, and had no sooner delivered
over the duck to his sister, the housekeeper, than he flew in the owl's
face, and, venting an abundance of reproachful terms, would, in his
passion, have torn the very eyes out of the White Owl's head.

""Softly, Peepi,"" said the Gray Eagle, stepping in between them. ""Don't
be in such a huff, my little brother, nor exhibit so revengeful a
temper. Do you not know that we are to forgive our enemies? White Owl,
you may go; but let this be a lesson to you, not to play the tyrant over
those who may chance to be weaker than yourself."""
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,13,"So, after adding to this much more good advice, and telling him what
kind of herbs would cure his wounds, Gray Eagle dismissed White Owl, and
the four brothers and sisters sat down to supper.

The next day, betimes, in the morning, before the household had fairly
rubbed the cobwebs out of the corners of their eyes, there came a knock
at the front door--which was a dry branch that lay down before the
hollow of the tree in which they lodged--and being called to come in,
who should make their appearance but the two nest-mates, who had just
returned from the South, where they had been wintering. There was great
rejoicing over their return, and now that they were all happily
re-united, each one soon chose a mate and began to keep house in the
woods for himself."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,14,"Spring had now revisited the North. The cold winds had all blown
themselves away, the ice had melted, the streams were open, and smiled
as they looked at the blue sky once more; and the forests, far and wide,
in their green mantle, echoed every cheerful sound.

But it is in vain that spring returns, and that the heart of Nature is
opened in bounty, if we are not thankful to the Master of Life, who has
preserved us through the winter. Nor does that man answer the end for
which he was made who does not show a kind and charitable feeling to all
who are in want or sickness, especially to his blood relations."
gray-eagle-and-his-five-brothers,15,"The love and harmony of Gray Eagle and his brothers continued. They
never forgot each other. Every week, on the fourth afternoon of the week
(for that was the time when they had found their wounded elder brother),
they had a meeting in the hollow of the old sycamore-tree, when they
talked over family matters, and advised with each other, as brothers
should, about their affairs."
hans-in-luck,1,"HANS had served his master seven years. At the end of the seventh year he said, 
""Master, my time is up. I want to go home and see my mother, so give me my wages."" 
""You have served me truly and faithfully,"" said the master. ""As the service is, so must the wages be,"" and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his way home. And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man riding on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. ""Oh!"" cried Hans aloud, ""how splendid riding must be! Sitting as much at one's ease as in an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving one's shoes, and getting on one hardly knows how!"" 
The horseman heard Hans say this, and called out to him, 
""Well Hans, what are you doing on foot?"""
hans-in-luck,2,"""I can't help myself,"" said Hans, ""I have this great lump to carry. To be sure, it is gold, but then I can't hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder."" 
""I'll tell you what,"" said the horseman, ""we will change. I will give you my horse, and you shall give me your lump of gold."" 
""With all my heart,"" said Hans. ""But I warn you, you will find it heavy."" And the horseman got down and took the gold. Helping Hans up, he gave the reins into his hand. 
""When you want to go fast,"" said he, ""you must click your tongue and cry 'Gee-up!'"""
hans-in-luck,3,"And Hans, as he sat upon his horse, was glad at heart, and rode off with merry cheer. After a while he thought he should like to go quicker, so he began to click with his tongue and to cry ""Gee-up!"" And the horse began to trot, and Hans was thrown before he knew what was going to happen. There he lay in the ditch by the side of the road. The horse would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that way and driving a cow before him. And Hans pulled himself together and got upon his feet, feeling very vexed. ""Poor work, riding,"" said he. ""Especially on a jade like this, who starts off and throws you before you know where you are, going near to break your neck. Never shall I try that game again. Now, your cow is something worth having. One can jog on comfortably after her and have her milk, butter, and cheese every day, into the bargain. What would I not give to have such a cow!"""
hans-in-luck,4,"""Well now,"" said the peasant, ""since it will be doing you such a favour, I don't mind exchanging my cow for your horse."" 
Hans agreed most joyfully, and the peasant, swinging himself into the saddle, was soon out of sight. 
And Hans went along driving his cow quietly before him, and thinking all the while of the fine bargain he had made. 
""With only a piece of bread I shall have everything I can possibly want, for I shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it. If I am thirsty I have nothing to do but to milk my cow. What more is there for heart to wish!"""
hans-in-luck,5,"And when he came to an inn he made a halt, and in the joy of his heart ate up all the food he had brought with him, dinner and supper and all. He bought half a glass of beer with his last two farthings. Then on he went again driving his cow, until he should come to the village where his mother lived. It was now near the middle of the day, and the sun grew hotter and hotter. Hans found himself on a heath which it would be an hour's journey to cross. And he began to feel very hot, and so thirsty that his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth."
hans-in-luck,6,"""Never mind,"" said Hans. ""I can find a remedy. I will milk my cow at once."" And tying her to a dry tree, and taking off his leather cap to serve for a pail, he began to milk, but not a drop came. And as he set to work rather awkwardly, the impatient beast gave him such a kick on the head with his hind foot that he fell to the ground. For some time could not think where he was. When luckily there came by a butcher who was wheeling along a young pig in a wheelbarrow. 
""Here's a fine piece of work!"" cried he, helping poor Hans on his legs again. Then Hans related to him all that had happened. The butcher handed him his pocket-flask, saying, 
""Here, take a drink, and be a man again. Of course the cow would give no milk. She is old and only fit to draw burdens, or to be slaughtered."""
hans-in-luck,7,"""Well, to be sure,"" said Hans, scratching his head. ""Who would have thought it? of course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man has a beast of his own to kill. For my part I do not care much about cow beef, it is rather tasteless. Now, if I had but a young pig, that is much better meat, and then the sausages!"" 
""Look here, Hans,"" said the butcher, ""just for love of you I will exchange, and will give you my pig instead of your cow."" 
""Heaven reward such kindness!"" cried Hans. Handing over the cow, he received in exchange the pig, who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string. 
So on went Hans, thinking how everything turned out according to his wishes, and how, if trouble overtook him, all was sure to be set right directly. After a while he fell in with a peasant, who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They bid each other good-day, and Hans began to tell about his luck, and how he had made so many good exchanges. And the peasant told how he was taking the goose to a christening feast."
hans-in-luck,8,"""Just feel how heavy it is,"" said he, taking it up by the wings. ""It has been fattening for the last eight weeks. When it is roasted, won't the fat run down!"" 
""Yes, indeed,"" said Hans, weighing it in his hand, ""very fine to be sure; but my pig is not to be despised."" 
Upon which the peasant glanced cautiously on all sides, and shook his head. 
""I am afraid,"" said he, ""that there is something not quite right about your pig. In the village I have just left one had actually been stolen from the bailiff's yard. I fear, I fear you have it in your hand. They have sent after the thief, and it would be a bad look-out for you if it was found upon you. The least that could happen would be to be thrown into a dark hole."" 
Poor Hans grew pale with fright. ""For heaven's sake,"" said he, ""help me out of this scrape, I am a stranger in these parts. Take my pig and give me your goose."""
hans-in-luck,9,"""It will be running some risk,"" answered the man, ""but I will do it sooner than that you should come to grief."" And so, taking the cord in his hand, he drove the pig quickly along a by-path. Lucky Hans went on his way home with the goose under his arm. ""The more I think of it,"" said he to himself, ""the better the bargain seems. First I get the roast goose, then the fat, that will last a whole year for bread and dripping. Lastly the beautiful white feathers which I can stuff my pillow with. How comfortably I shall sleep upon it, and how pleased my mother will be!"" 
And when he reached the last village, he saw a knife-grinder with his barrow. His wheel went whirring round, and he sang, 
    ""My scissors I grind, and my wheel I turn.     And all good fellows my trade should learn,     For all that I meet with just serves my turn."" 
And Hans stood and looked at him. At last he spoke to him and said, 
""You seem very well off, and merry with your grinding."""
hans-in-luck,10,"""Yes,"" answered the knife-grinder, ""my handiwork pays very well. I call a man a good grinder who, every time he puts his hand in his pocket finds money there. But where did you buy that fine goose?"" 
""I did not buy it, but I exchanged it for my pig,"" said Hans. 
""And the pig?"" 
""That I exchanged for a cow."" 
""And the cow?"" 
""That I exchanged for a horse."" 
""And the horse?"" 
""I gave for the horse a lump of gold as big as my head."" 
""And the gold?"" 
""Oh, that was my wage for seven years' service."" 
""You seem to have fended for yourself very well,"" said the knife-grinder. ""Now, if you could but manage to have money in your pocket every time you put your hand in, your fortune is made."" 
""How shall I manage that?"" said Hans."
hans-in-luck,11,"""You must be a knife-grinder like me,"" said the man. ""All you want is a grindstone, the rest comes of itself: I have one here. To be sure it is a little damaged, but I don't mind letting you have it in exchange for your goose. What say you?"" 
""How can you ask?"" answered Hans. ""I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world. For if I find money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, there is nothing more left to want."" 
And so he handed over the goose to the pedlar and received the grindstone in exchange. 
""Now,"" said the knife-grinder, taking up a heavy common stone that lay near him, ""here is another proper sort of stone that will stand a good deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old nails upon. Take it with you, and carry it carefully."" 
Hans lifted up the stone and carried it off with a contented mind. ""I must have been born under a lucky star!"" cried he, while his eyes sparkled for joy. ""I have only to wish for a thing and it is mine."""
hans-in-luck,12,"After a while he began to feel rather tired, as indeed he had been on his legs since daybreak. He also began to feel rather hungry. In the fulness of his joy at getting the cow, he had eaten up all he had. At last he could scarcely go on at all, and had to make a halt every moment. The stones weighed him down most unmercifully. He could not help wishing that he did not feel obliged to drag them along. And on he went at a snail's pace until he came to a well. Then he thought he would rest and take a drink of the fresh water. And he placed the stones carefully by his side at the edge of the well. Then he sat down, and as he stooped to drink, he happened to give the stones a little push. They both fell into the water with a splash."
hans-in-luck,13,"And then Hans, having watched them disappear, jumped for joy, and thanked his stars that he had been so lucky as to get rid of the stones that had weighed upon him so long without any effort of his own. 
""I really think,"" cried he, ""I am the luckiest man under the sun."" So on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother's house."
happy-prince,1,"High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.He was very much admired indeed.  ""He is as beautiful as a weathercock,"" remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ""only not quite so useful,"" he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not."
happy-prince,2,"""Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?"" asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.  ""The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.""""I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,"" muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.""He looks just like an angel,"" said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.""How do you know?"" said the Mathematical Master, ""you have never seen one.""""Ah! but we have, in our dreams,"" answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming."
happy-prince,3,"One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.""Shall I love you?"" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.""It is a ridiculous attachment,"" twittered the other Swallows; ""she has no money, and far too many relations""; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away."
happy-prince,4,"After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.  ""She has no conversation,"" he said, ""and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.""  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  ""I admit that she is domestic,"" he continued, ""but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.""""Will you come away with me?"" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.""You have been trifling with me,"" he cried.  ""I am off to the Pyramids.  Good-bye!"" and he flew away.All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  ""Where shall I put up?"" he said; ""I hope the town has made preparations.""Then he saw the statue on the tall column."
happy-prince,5,"""I will put up there,"" he cried; ""it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.""  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.""I have a golden bedroom,"" he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  ""What a curious thing!"" he cried; ""there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.""Then another drop fell.""What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?"" he said; ""I must look for a good chimney-pot,"" and he determined to fly away."
happy-prince,6,"But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw-Ah! what did he see? The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.""Who are you?"" he said.""I am the Happy Prince.""""Why are you weeping then?"" asked the Swallow; ""you have quite drenched me.""""When I was alive and had a human heart,"" answered the statue, ""I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep."""
happy-prince,7,"""What! is he not solid gold?"" said the Swallow to himself.  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.""Far away,"" continued the statue in a low musical voice, ""far away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."""
happy-prince,8,"""I am waited for in Egypt,"" said the Swallow.  ""My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there himself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.""""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.""""I don't think I like boys,"" answered the Swallow.  ""Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.""But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.  ""It is very cold here,"" he said; ""but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."""
happy-prince,9,"""Thank you, little Swallow,"" said the Prince.So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  ""How wonderful the stars are,"" he said to her, ""and how wonderful is the power of love!""""I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,"" she answered; ""I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy."""
happy-prince,10,"He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he came to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble.  Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings.  ""How cool I feel,"" said the boy, ""I must be getting better""; and he sank into a delicious slumber.Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.  ""It is curious,"" he remarked, ""but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.""""That is because you have done a good action,"" said the Prince.  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always made him sleepy."
happy-prince,11,"When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  ""What a remarkable phenomenon,"" said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.  ""A swallow in winter!""  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.""To-night I go to Egypt,"" said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, ""What a distinguished stranger!"" so he enjoyed himself very much.When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  ""Have you any commissions for Egypt?"" he cried; ""I am just starting.""""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me one night longer?"""
happy-prince,12,"""I am waited for in Egypt,"" answered the Swallow.  ""To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.""""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""far away across the city I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint."""
happy-prince,13,"""I will wait with you one night longer,"" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart.  ""Shall I take him another ruby?""""Alas!  I have no ruby now,"" said the Prince; ""my eyes are all that I have left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.  He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.""""Dear Prince,"" said the Swallow, ""I cannot do that""; and he began to weep.""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""do as I command you.""So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets."
happy-prince,14,"""I am beginning to be appreciated,"" he cried; ""this is from some great admirer.  Now I can finish my play,"" and he looked quite happy.The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  ""Heave a-hoy!"" they shouted as each chest came up.  ""I am going to Egypt""! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.""I am come to bid you good-bye,"" he cried.""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me one night longer?""""It is winter,"" answered the Swallow, ""and the chill snow will soon be here.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea."""
happy-prince,15,"""In the square below,"" said the Happy Prince, ""there stands a little match-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.""""I will stay with you one night longer,"" said the Swallow, ""but I cannot pluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.""""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""do as I command you.""So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it.  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.  ""What a lovely bit of glass,"" cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.  ""You are blind now,"" he said, ""so I will stay with you always.""""No, little Swallow,"" said the poor Prince, ""you must go away to Egypt.""""I will stay with you always,"" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet."
happy-prince,16,"All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.""Dear little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there."""
happy-prince,17,"So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm.  ""How hungry we are!"" they said.  ""You must not lie here,"" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.""I am covered with fine gold,"" said the Prince, ""you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy."""
happy-prince,18,"Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  ""We have bread now!"" they cried.Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.But at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.  ""Good-bye, dear Prince!"" he murmured, ""will you let me kiss your hand?"""
happy-prince,19,"""I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.""""It is not to Egypt that I am going,"" said the Swallow.  ""I am going to the House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?""And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: ""Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!"" he said."
happy-prince,20,"""How shabby indeed!"" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.""The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,"" said the Mayor in fact, ""he is litttle better than a beggar!""""Little better than a beggar,"" said the Town Councillors.""And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!"" continued the Mayor.  ""We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.""  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion."
happy-prince,21,"So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  ""As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,"" said the Art Professor at the University. Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  ""We must have another statue, of course,"" he said, ""and it shall be a statue of myself.""""Of myself,"" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.""What a strange thing!"" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.  ""This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it away.""  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.""Bring me the two most precious things in the city,"" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.""You have rightly chosen,"" said God, ""for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me."""
he-of-the-little-shell,1,"Once upon a time, all the people of a certain country had died,
excepting two helpless children, a baby boy and a little girl.

When their parents died, these children were asleep. The little girl,
who was the elder, was the first to awake. She looked around her, but
seeing nobody beside her little brother, who lay smiling in his dreams,
she quietly resumed her bed.

At the end of ten days her brother moved, without opening his eyes.

At the end of ten days more he changed his position, lying on the other
side, and in this way he kept on sleeping for a long time; and pleasant,
too, must have been his dreams, for his little sister never looked at
him that he was not quite a little heaven of smiles and flashing lights,
which beamed about his head and filled the lodge with a strange
splendor."
he-of-the-little-shell,2,"The girl soon grew to be a woman, but the boy increased in stature very
slowly. It was a long time before he could even creep, and he was well
advanced in years before he could stand alone. When he was able to
walk, his sister made him a little bow and arrows, and hung around his
neck a small shell, saying:

""You shall be called Dais Imid, or He of the Little Shell.""

Every day he would go out with his little bow, shooting at the small
birds. The first bird he killed was a tom-tit. His sister was highly
pleased when he took it to her. She carefully prepared and stuffed it,
and put it away for him."
he-of-the-little-shell,3,"The next day he killed a red squirrel. His sister preserved this, too.
The third day he killed a partridge, and this they had for their evening
meal.

After this he acquired more courage, and would venture some distance
from home. His skill and success as a hunter daily increased, and he
killed the deer, bear, moose, and other large animals inhabiting the
forest.

At last, although so very small of stature, he became a great hunter,
and all that he shot he brought home and shared with his sister; and
whenever he entered the lodge, a light beamed about his head and filled
the place with a strange splendor."
he-of-the-little-shell,4,"He had now arrived at the years of manhood, but he still remained a
perfect infant in size.

One day, walking about in quest of game, he came to a small lake.

It was in the winter season; and upon the ice of the lake he saw a man
of giant height, employed killing beavers.

Comparing himself with this great man, he felt that he was no bigger
than an insect. He seated himself on the shore and watched his
movements.

When the large man had killed many beavers, he put them on a hand-sled
which he had, and pursued his way home."
he-of-the-little-shell,5,"When he saw him retire, the
dwarf hunter followed, and, wielding his magic shell, he cut off the
tail of one of the beavers, and ran home with the prize.

The giant, on reaching his lodge with his sled-load of beavers, was
surprised to find one of them shorn of its tail.

The next day the little hero of the shell went to the same lake. The
giant, who had been busy there for some time, had already loaded his
sled and commenced his return; but running nimbly forward and overtaking
him, he succeeded in securing another of the beaver-tails."
he-of-the-little-shell,6,"""I wonder,"" said the giant, on reaching his lodge and overlooking his
beavers, ""what dog it is that has thus cheated me. Could I meet him, I
would make his flesh quiver at the point of my javelin.""

The giant forgot that he had taken these very beavers out of a
beaver-dam which belonged to the little shell-man and his sister,
without permission.

The next day he pursued his hunting at the beaver-dam near the lake,
and he was again followed by the little man with the shell."
he-of-the-little-shell,7,"This time the giant was so nimble in his movements that he had nearly
reached home before the Shell, make the best speed he could, could
overtake him; but he was just in time to clip another beaver's tail
before the sled slipped into the lodge.

The giant would have been a patient giant, indeed, if his anger had not
been violent at these constant tricks played upon him. What vexed him
most, was, that he could not get a sight of his enemy. Sharp eyes he
would have needed to do so, inasmuch as he of the little shell had the
gift of making himself invisible whenever he chose."
he-of-the-little-shell,8,"The giant, giving vent to his feelings with many loud rumbling words,
looked sharply around to see whether he could discover any tracks. He
could find none. The unknown had stepped too lightly to leave the
slightest mark behind.

The next day the giant resolved to disappoint his mysterious follower by
going to the beaver-dam very early; and accordingly, when the little
shell man came to the place he found the fresh traces of his work, but
the giant had already gone away. He followed hard upon his tracks, but
he failed to overtake him. When he of the little shell came in sight of
the lodge, the stranger was in front of it, employed in skinning his
beavers."
he-of-the-little-shell,9,"As Dais-Imid stood looking at him--for he had been all this time
invisible--he thought:

""I will let him have a view of me.""

Presently the man, who proved to be no less a personage than the
celebrated giant, Manabozho, looked up and saw him.

After regarding him with attention, ""Who are you, little man?"" said
Manabozho. ""I have a mind to kill you.""

The little hero of the shell replied:

""If you were to try to kill me you could not do it.""

With this speech of the little man, Manabozho grabbed at him; but when
he thought to have had him in his hand, he was gone."
he-of-the-little-shell,10,"""Where are you now, little man?"" cried Manabozho.

""Here, under your girdle,"" answered the shell-dwarf; at which giant
Manabozho, thinking to crush him, slapped down his great hand with all
his might; but on unloosing his girdle he was disappointed at finding no
dwarf there.

""Where are you now, little man?"" he cried again, in a greater rage than
ever.

""In your right nostril!"" the dwarf replied; whereupon the giant
Manabozho seized himself by the finger and thumb at the place, and gave
it a violent tweak; but as he immediately heard the voice of the dwarf
at a distance upon the ground, he was satisfied that he had only pulled
his own nose to no purpose."
he-of-the-little-shell,11,"""Good-by, Manabozho,"" said the voice of the invisible dwarf. ""Count your
beaver-tails, and you will find that I have taken another for my
sister;"" for he of the little shell never, in his wanderings or
pastimes, forgot his sister and her wishes. ""Good-by, beaver-man!""

And as he went away he made himself visible once more, and a light
beamed about his head and lit the air around him with a strange
splendor; a circumstance which Manabozho, who was at times quite
thick-headed and dull of apprehension, could no way understand.

When Dais-Imid returned home, he told his sister that the time drew nigh
when they must separate.

""I must go away,"" said Dais-Imid, ""it is my fate. You, too,"" he added,
""must go away soon. Tell me where you would wish to dwell."""
he-of-the-little-shell,12,"She said, ""I would like to go to the place of the breaking of daylight.
I have always loved the East. The earliest glimpses of light are from
that quarter, and it is to my mind the most beautiful part of the
heavens. After I get there, my brother, whenever you see the clouds, in
that direction, of various colors, you may think that your sister is
painting her face.""

""And I,"" said he, ""I, my sister, shall live on the mountains and rocks.
There I can see you at the earliest hour; there are the streams of
water clear; the air is pure, and the golden lights will shine ever
around my head, and I shall ever be called 'Puck-Ininee, or the Little
Wild Man of the Mountains.' But,"" he resumed, ""before we part forever, I
must go and try to find what manitoes rule the earth, and see which of
them will be friendly to us."""
he-of-the-little-shell,13,"He left his sister and traveled over the surface of the globe, and then
went far down into the earth.

He had been treated well wherever he went. At last he came to a giant
manito, who had a large kettle which was forever boiling. The giant, who
was a first cousin to Manabozho, and had already heard of the tricks
which Dais-Imid had played upon his kinsman, regarded him with a stern
look, and, catching him up in his hand, he threw him unceremoniously
into the kettle.

It was evidently the giant's intention to drown Dais-Imid; in which he
was mistaken, for by means of his magic shell, little Dais, in less than
a second's time, bailed the water to the bottom, leaped from the kettle,
and ran away unharmed.

He returned to his sister and related his rovings and adventures. He
finished his story by addressing her thus:"
he-of-the-little-shell,14,"""My sister there is a manito at each of the four corners of the earth.
There is also one above them, far in the sky, a Great Being who assigns
to you, and to me, and to all of us, where we must go. And last,"" he
continued, ""there is another and wicked one who lives deep down in the
earth. It will be our lot to escape out of his reach. We must now
separate. When the winds blow from the four corners of the earth, you
must then go. They will carry you to the place you wish. I go to the
rocks and mountains, where my kindred will ever delight to dwell.""

Dais-Imid then took his ball-stick and commenced running up a high
mountain, and a bright light shone about his head all the way, and he
kept singing as he went:"
he-of-the-little-shell,15,"Blow, winds, blow! my sister lingers
      For her dwelling in the sky,
    Where the morn, with rosy fingers,
      Shall her cheeks with vermil dye.

    There my earliest views directed,
      Shall from her their color take,
    And her smiles, through clouds reflected,
      Guide me on by wood or lake.

    While I range the highest mountains,
      Sport in valleys green and low,
    Or, beside our Indian fountains,
      Raise my tiny hip-hallo.

Presently the winds blew, and, as Dais-Imid had predicted, his sister
was borne by them to the eastern sky, where she has ever since lived,
and her name is now the Morning Star."
help-in-need,1,Some twenty miles east of Gingdschou lies the Lake of the Maidens. It is several miles square and surrounded on all sides by thick green thickets and tall forests. Its waters are clear and dark-blue. Often all kinds of wondrous creatures show themselves in the lake. The people of the vicinity have erected a temple there for the Dragon Princess. And in times of drought all make pilgrimage there to offer up prayers.
help-in-need,2,"West of Gingdschou, two hundred miles away, is another lake, whose god is named Tschauna, and who performs many miracles. During the time of the Tang dynasty there lived in Gingdschou a mandarin by name of Dschou Bau. While he was in office it chanced that in the fifth month clouds suddenly arose in the sky, piling themselves up like mountains, among which wriggled dragons and serpents; they rolled up and down between the two seas. Tempest and rain, thunder and lightning arose so that houses fell to pieces, trees were torn up by the roots, and much damage was done the crops. Dschou Bau took the blame upon himself, and prayed to the heavens that his people might be pardoned."
help-in-need,3,"On the fifth day of the sixth month he sat in his hall of audience and gave judgment; and suddenly he felt quite weary and sleepy. He took off his hat and laid down on the cushions. No sooner had he closed his eyes than he saw a warrior in helmet and armor, with a halberd in his hand, standing on the steps leading to the hall, who announced: ""A lady is waiting outside who wishes to enter!"" Dschou Bau asked him: ""Who are you?"" The answer was: ""I am your door-keeper. In the invisible world I already have been performing this duty for many years."" Meanwhile two figures clad in green came up the steps, knelt before him and said: ""Our mistress has come to visit you!"" Dschou Bau rose. He beheld lovely clouds, from which fell a fine rain, and strange fragrances enchanted him. Suddenly he saw a lady clad in a simple gown, but of surpassing beauty, float down from on high, with a retinue of many female servants. These were all neat and clean in appearance, and waited upon the lady as though she were a princess. When the latter entered the hall she raised her arms in greeting. Dschou Bau came forward to meet her and invited her to be seated."
help-in-need,4,"From all sides bright-colored clouds came floating in, and the courtyard was filled with a purple ether. Dschou Bau had wine and food brought and entertained them all in the most splendid way. But the goddess sat staring straight before her with wrinkled brows, and seemed to feel very sad. Then she rose and said with a blush: ""I have been living in this neighborhood for many years. A wrong which has been done me, permits me to pass the bounds of what is fitting, and encourages me to ask a favor of you. Yet I do not know whether you wish to save me!""

""May I hear what it is all about,"" answered Dschou Bau. ""If I can help you, I will be glad to place myself at your disposal."""
help-in-need,5,"The goddess said: ""For hundreds of years my family has been living in the depth of the Eastern Sea. But we were unfortunate in that our treasures excited the jealousy of men. The ancestor of Pi-Lo nearly destroyed our entire clan by fire. My ancestors had to fly and hide themselves. And not long ago, our enemy Pi-Lo himself wanted to deliver an imperial letter in the cave of the Sea of Dungting. Under the pretext of begging for pearls and treasures, he wished to enter the dragon-castle and destroy our family. Fortunately a wise man saw through his treacherous purpose, and Lo-Dsi-Tschun and his brothers were sent in his stead. Yet my people did not feel safe from future attacks. For this reason they withdrew to the distant West. My father has done much good to mankind and hence is highly honored there. I am his ninth daughter. When I was sixteen I was wedded to the youngest son of the Rock-Dragon. But my good husband had a fiery temper, which often caused him to offend against the laws of courtesy, and in less than a year's time the punishment of heaven was his portion. I was left alone and returned to the home of my parents."
help-in-need,6,"My father wished me to marry again; but I had promised to remain true to the memory of my husband, and made a vow not to comply with my father's wish. My parents grew angry, and I was obliged to retire to this place in view of their anger. That was three years ago. Who could imagine that the contemptible dragon Tschauna, who was seeking a wife for his youngest brother, would try to force the wedding-gift upon me? I refused to accept it; but Tschauna knew how to gain his point with my father, and was determined to carry out his intention. My father, regardless of my wishes, promised me to him. And then the dragon Tschauna appeared with his youngest brother and wanted to carry me off by sheer force of arms. I encountered him with fifty faithful followers, and we fought on the meadow before the city. We were defeated, and I am more than ever afraid that Tschauna will attempt to drag me off. So I have plucked up courage to beg you to lend me your mercenaries so that I may beat off my foes and remain as I am. If you will help me I will be grateful to you till the end of my days."""
help-in-need,7,"Dschou Bau answered: ""You come from a noble family. Have you no kinsfolk who will hasten to help you in your need, that you are compelled to turn to a mortal man?""

""It is true that my kinsfolk are far-famed and numerous. If I were to send out letters and they came to my aid, they would rub out that scaly scoundrel Tschauna as one might rub garlic. But my deceased husband offended the high heavens and he has not yet been pardoned. And my parents' will, too, is opposed to mine, so that I dare not call upon my kinsfolk for help. You will understand my need."" Then Dschou Bau promised to help her, and the princess thanked him and departed."
help-in-need,8,"When he awoke, he sighed long thinking over his strange experience. And the following day he sent off fifteen hundred soldiers to stand guard by the Lake of the Maidens.

On the seventh day of the sixth month Dschou Bau rose early. Darkness still lay before the windows, yet it seemed to him as though he could glimpse a man before the curtain. He asked who it might be. The man said: ""I am the princess's adviser. Yesterday you were kind enough to send soldiers to aid us in our distress. But they were all living men, and such cannot fight against invisible spirits. You will have to send us soldiers of yours who have died, if you wish to aid us."""
help-in-need,9,"Dschou Bau reflected for a time, and then it occurred to him that of course such must be the case. So he had his field-secretary examine the roster to see how many of his soldiers had fallen in battle. And the latter counted up to some two thousand foot-soldiers and five-hundred horsemen. Dschou Bau appointed his deceased officer Mong Yuan as their leader, and wrote his commands on a paper which he burned, in order thus to place them at the princess's disposal. The living soldiers he recalled. When they were being reviewed in the courtyard after their return, a soldier suddenly fell unconscious. It was not until early the following morning that he came to his senses again."
help-in-need,10,"He was questioned and replied: ""I saw a man clad in red who approached me and said: 'Our princess is grateful for the aid your master has so kindly given her. Yet she still has a request to make and has asked me to call you.' I followed him to the temple. The princess bade me come forward and said to me: 'I thank your master from my heart for sending me the ghost soldiers, but Mong Yuan, their leader is incapable. Yesterday the robbers came with three thousand men, and Mong Yuan was beaten by them. When you return and again see your master, say that I earnestly beg him to send me a good general. Perhaps that will save me in my need.' Then she had me led back again and I regained consciousness."""
help-in-need,11,"When Dschou Bau had heard these words, which seemed to fit strangely well with what he had dreamed, he thought he would try to see if this were really the case. Therefore he chose his victorious general Dschong Tschong-Fu to take the place of Mong Yuan. That evening he burned incense, offered wine and handed over to the princess this captain's soul."
help-in-need,12,"On the twenty-sixth of the month news came from the general's camp that he had suddenly died at midnight on the thirteenth. Dschou Bau was frightened, and sent a man to bring him a report. The latter informed him that the general's heart had hardly ceased to beat, and that, in spite of the hot summer weather, his body was free from any trace of decay. So the order was given not to bury him."
help-in-need,13,"Then one night an icy, spectral wind arose, which whirled up sand and stones, broke trees and tore down houses. The standing corn in the fields was blown down. The storm lasted all day. Finally, the crash of a terrific thunderbolt was heard, and then the skies cleared and the clouds scattered. That very hour the dead general began to breathe painfully on his couch, and when his attendants came to him, he had returned to life again."
help-in-need,14,"They questioned him and he told them: ""First I saw a man in a purple gown riding a black horse, who came up with a great retinue. He dismounted before the door. In his hand he held a decree of appointment which he gave me, saying: 'Our princess begs you most respectfully to become her general. I hope that you will not refuse.' Then he brought forth gifts and heaped them up before the steps. Jade-stones, brocades, and silken garments, saddles, horses, helmets and suits of mail-he heaped them all up in the courtyard. I wished to decline, but this he would not allow, and urged me to enter his chariot with him. We drove a hundred miles and met a train of three-hundred armored horsemen who had ridden out to escort me. They led me to a great city, and before the city a tent had been erected in which played a band of musicians. A high official welcomed me."
help-in-need,15,"When I entered the city the onlookers were crowded together like walls. Servants ran to and fro bearing orders. We passed through more than a dozen gates before we reached the princess. There I was requested to dismount and change my clothes in order to enter the presence of the princess, for she wished to receive me as her guest. But I thought this too great an honor and greeted her below, on the steps. She, however, invited me to seat myself near her in the hall. She sat upright in all her incomparable beauty, surrounded by female attendants adorned with the richest jewels. These plucked lute-strings and played flutes. A throng of servitors stood about in golden girdles with purple tassels, ready to carry out her commands. Countless crowds were assembled before the palace. Five or six visitors sat in a circle about the princess, and a general led me to my place. The princess said to me: 'I have begged you to come here in order to entrust the command of my army to you. If you will break the power of my foe I will reward you richly.' I promised to obey her. Then wine was brought in, and the banquet was served to the sound of music. While we were at table a messenger entered: 'The robber Tschauna has invaded our land with ten thousand footmen and horsemen, and is approaching our city by various roads."
help-in-need,16,"His way is marked by columns of fire and smoke!' The guests all grew pale with terror when they heard the news. And the princess said: 'This is the foe because of whom I have sought your aid. Save me in my hour of need!' Then she gave me two chargers, a suit of golden armor, and the insignia of a commander-in-chief, and bowed to me. I thanked her and went, called together the captains, had the army mustered and rode out before the city. At several decisive points I placed troops in ambush. The enemy was already approaching in great force, careless and unconcerned, intoxicated by his former victories. I sent out my most untrustworthy soldiers in advance, who allowed themselves to be beaten in order to lure him on. Light-armed men then went out against him, and retreated in skirmish order. And thus he fell into my ambush. Drums and kettledrums sounded together, the ring closed around them on all sides and the robber army suffered a grievous defeat. The dead lay about like hemp-stalks, but little Tschauna succeeded in breaking through the circle."
help-in-need,17,"I sent out the light horsemen after him, and they seized him before the tent of the enemy's commanding general. Hastily I sent word to the princess, and she reviewed the prisoners before the palace. All the people, high and low, streamed together, to acclaim her. Little Tschauna was about to be executed in the market place when a messenger came spurring up with a command from the princess's father to pardon him. The princess did not dare to disobey. So he was dismissed to his home after he had sworn to give up all thought of realizing his traitorous plans. I was loaded with benefits as a reward for my victory. I was invested with an estate with three thousand peasants, and was given a palace, horses and wagons, all sorts of jewels, men-servants and women-servants, gardens and forests, banners and suits of mail."
help-in-need,18,"And my subordinate officers, too, were duly rewarded. On the following day a banquet was held, and the princess herself filled a goblet, sent it to me by one of her attendants, and said: 'Widowed early in life, I opposed the wishes of my stern father and fled to this spot. Here the infamous Tschauna harassed me and well-nigh put me to shame. Had not your master's great kindness and your own courage come to my assistance, hard would have been my lot!' Then she began to thank me and her tears of emotion flowed like a stream. I bowed and begged her to grant me leave of absence, so that I might look after my family. I was given a month's leave and the following day she dismissed me with a splendid retinue. Before the city a pavilion had been erected in which I drank the stirrup-cup. Then I rode away and when I arrived before our own gate a thunder-peal crashed and I awoke."""
help-in-need,19,"Thereupon the general wrote an account of what had happened to Dschou Bau, in which he conveyed the princess's thanks. Then he paid no further heed to worldly matters, but set his house in order and turned it over to his wife and son. When a month had passed, he died without any sign of illness.

That same day one of his officers was out walking. Suddenly he saw a heavy cloud of dust rising along the highway, while flags and banners darkened the sun. A thousand knights were escorting a man who sat his horse proudly and like a hero. And when the officer looked at his face, it was the general Dschong Tschong-Fu. Hastily he stepped to the edge of the road, in order to allow the cavalcade to pass, and watched it ride by. The horsemen took the way to the Lake of the Maidens, where they disappeared."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,1,"A little back from the high road there stands a house which is called
'Hemgard.' Perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by
the reddish-brown palings, and the high gate. Or you remember the garden with the
beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown
in spring, and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful
berries.

Behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the
morning wind. Behind the hedge is a road, behind the road is a wood, and
behind the wood the wide world.

But on the other side of the garden there is a lake, and beyond the lake
is a village, and all around stretch meadows and fields, now yellow, now
green.

In the pretty house, which has white window-frames, a neat porch and
clean steps, which are always strewn with finely-cut juniper leaves,
Walter's parents live. His brother Frederick, his sister Lotta, old
Lena, Jonah, Caro and Bravo, Putte and Murre, and Kuckeliku.

Caro lives in the dog house, Bravo in the stable, Putte with the
stableman, Murre a little here and a little there, and Kuckeliku lives
in the hen house, that is his kingdom."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,2,"Walter is six years old, and he must soon begin to go to school.
He cannot read yet, but he can do many other things. He can turn
cartwheels, stand on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball,
crow like a cock, eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, and tear his
trousers. He can wear holes in his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw
balls through the windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk
over the flower-beds, eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well
after a whipping. For the rest he has a good heart but a bad memory,
and forgets his father's and his mother's admonitions. He so often gets
into trouble and meets with adventures, as you shall hear, but first of
all I must tell you how brave he was and how he hunted wolves.

Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there
were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him. He was
wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home
with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say 'One wolf is
nothing, there ought to be at least four.'

When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck
them in the back, he would say 'That is what I shall do to a wolf!' When he shot arrows at Jonas and they rattled against his sheepskin coat
he would say: 'That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!'"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,3,"Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little. One must
indeed believe him since he said so himself. So Jonas and Lena used to
say of him 'Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves.' And other
boys and girls would say 'Look, there goes brave Walter, who is brave
enough to fight with four.'

There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one
day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. He took with him his drum,
which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to
reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little
broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a
whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes.

He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun,
his bow, and his air-pistol. He had a burnt cork in his pocket to
blacken his moustache, and a red cock's feather to put in his cap to
make himself look fierce. He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp
knife with a bone handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as
he had killed them. He thought it would be cruel to do that while
they were still living."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,4,"It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for
Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them. As
soon as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to
see perchance there was a wolf in the bushe. He did not omit to
ask Jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum. 'Of course they are' (that is
understood) said Jonas. Thereupon Walter began to beat his drum with all
his might while they were going through the wood.

When they came to the mill Walter immediately asked if there had been
any wolves in the neighbourhood lately."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,5,"'Alas! yes,' said the miller, 'last night the wolves have eaten our
fattest ram there by the kiln not far from here.'

'Ah!' said Walter, 'do you think that there were many?'

'We don't know,' answered the miller.

'Oh, it is all the same,' said Walter. 'I only asked so that I should
know if I should take Jonas with me.'

'I could manage very well alone with three, but if there were more, I
might not have time to kill them all before they ran away.'

'In Walter's place I should go quite alone, it is more manly,' said
Jonas.

'No, it is better for you to come too,' said Walter. 'Perhaps there are
many.'

'No, I have not time,' said Jonas, 'and besides, there are sure not to
be more than three. Walter can manage them very well alone.'

'Yes,' said Walter, 'certainly I could. But, you see, Jonas, it might
happen that one of them might bite me in the back, and I should have
more trouble in killing them. If I only knew that there were not more
than two I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and
give them a good shaking, like Susanna once shook me.'"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,6,"'I certainly think that there will not be more than two,' said Jonas,
'there are never more than two when they slay children and rams. Walter
can very well shake them without me.'

'But, you see, Jonas,' said Walter, 'if there are two, it might still
happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg. You see
I am not so strong in the left hand as in the right. You can very well
come with me, and take a good stick in case there are really two. Look,
if there is only one, I shall take him so with both my hands and thrown
him living on to his back. He can kick as much as he likes, I shall
hold him fast.'

'Now, when I really think over the thing,' said Jonas, 'I am almost sure
there will not be more than one. What would two do with one ram? There
will certainly not be more than one.'

'But you should come with me all the same, Jonas,' said Walter. 'You see
I can very well manage one, but I am not quite accustomed to wolves yet,
and he might tear holes in my new trousers.'

'Well, just listen,' said Jonas, 'I am beginning to think that Walter
is not so brave as people say. First of all Walter would fight against
four, and then against three, then two, and then one, and now Walter
wants help with one. Such a thing must never be. What would people say?
Perhaps they would think that Walter is a coward?'"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,7,"'That's a lie,' said Walter, 'I am not at all frightened, but it is
more amusing when there are two. I only want someone who will see how I
strike the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin.'

'Well, then, Walter can take the miller's little Lisa with him. She can
sit on a stone and look on,' said Jonas.

'No, she would certainly be frightened,' said Walter, 'and how would
it do for a girl to go wolf-hunting? Come with me, Jonas, and you shall
have the skin, and I will be content with the ears and the tail.'

'No, thank you,' said Jonas, 'Walter can keep the skin for himself. Now
I see quite well that he is frightened. Fie, shame on him!'"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,8,"This touched Walter's pride very near. 'I shall show that I am not
frightened,' he said. And so he took his drum, sabre, cock's feather,
clasp-knife, pop-gun and air-pistol, and went off quite alone to the
wood to hunt wolves.

It was a beautiful evening, and the birds were singing in all the
branches. Walter went very slowly and cautiously. At every step he
looked all round him to see if perchance there was anything lurking
behind the stones. He quite thought something moved away there in the
ditch. Perhaps it was a wolf. 'It is better for me to beat the drum a
little before I go there,' thought Walter.

Br-r-r, so he began to beat his drum. Then something moved again. Caw!
caw! a crow flew up from the ditch. Walter immediately regained courage.
'It was well I took my drum with me,' he thought, and went straight on
with courageous steps. Very soon he came quite close to the kiln, where
the wolves had killed the ram. But the nearer he came the more dreadful
he thought the kiln looked. It was so gray and old. Who knew how many
wolves there might be hidden there? Perhaps the very ones which killed
the ram were still sitting there in a corner. Yes, it was not at
all safe here, and there were no other people to be seen in the
neighbourhood. It would be horrible to be eaten up here in the daylight,
thought Walter to himself. The more he thought about it the uglier
and grayer the old kiln looked, and the more horrible and dreadful it
seemed to become the food of wolves."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,9,"'Shall I go back and say that I struck one wolf and it escaped?' thought
Walter. 'Fie!' said his conscience, 'Do you not remember that a lie is
one of the worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? If you tell a
lie to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you
up.'

'No, I will go to the kiln,' thought Walter, and so he went. But he
did not go quite near. He went only so near that he could see the ram's
blood which coloured the grass red, and some tufts of wool which the
wolves had torn from the back of the poor animal.

It looked so dreadful.

'I wonder what the ram thought when they ate him up,' thought Walter
to himself. Just then a cold shiver ran through him from his collar
right down to his boots.

'It is better for me to beat the drum,' he thought to himself again, and
so he began to beat it. But it sounded horrid, and an echo came out
from the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf. The drumsticks
stiffened in Walter's hands, and he thought now they are coming...!"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,10,"Yes, sure enough, just then a shaggy, reddish-brown wolf's head looked
out from under the kiln!

What did Walter do now? Yes, the brave Walter who alone could manage
four, threw his drum far away, took to his heels and ran. He ran as
fast as he could back to the mill.

But, alas! the wolf ran after him. Walter looked back; the wolf was
quicker than he and only a few steps behind him. Then Walter ran faster.
But fear got the better of him, he neither heard nor saw anything more.
He ran over sticks, stones and ditches. He lost drum-sticks, sabre,
bow, and air-pistol, and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of
grass. There he lay, and the wolf jumped on to him....

It was a gruesome tale! Now you may well believe that it was all over
with Walter and all his adventures. That would have been a pity. But do
not be surprised if it was not quite so bad as that, for the wolf was
quite a friendly one. He certainly jumped on to Walter, but he only
shook his coat and rubbed his nose against his face. Walter
shrieked. Yes, he shrieked terribly!"
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,11,"Happily Jonas heard his cry of distress, for Walter was quite near the
mill now, and he ran and helped him up.

'What has happened?' he asked. 'Why did Walter scream so terribly?'

'A wolf! A wolf!' cried Walter, and that was all he could say.

'Where is the wolf?' said Jonas. 'I don't see any wolf.'

'Take care, he is here, he has bitten me to death,' groaned Walter.

Then Jonas began to laugh. Yes, he laughed so that he nearly burst his
skin belt.

Well, well, was that the wolf? Was that the wolf which Walter was to
take by the neck and shake and throw down on its back, no matter how
much it struggled? Just look a little closer at him: he is your old
friend, your own good old Caro. I quite expect he found a leg of the ram
in the kiln. When Walter beat his drum, Caro crept out, and when Walter
ran away, Caro ran after him, as he so often does when Walter wants to
romp and play."
how-brave-walter-hunted-wolves,12,"'Down, Caro! you ought to be rather ashamed to have put such a great
hero to flight!'

Walter got up feeling very foolish.

'Down, Caro!' he said, both relieved and annoyed.

'It was only a dog, then if it had been a wolf I certainly should have
killed him....'

'If Walter would listen to my advice, and boast a little less, and do a
little more,' said Jonas, consolingly. 'Walter is not a coward, is he?'

'I! You shall see, Jonas, when we next meet a bear. You see I like so
much better to fight with bears.'

'Indeed!' laughed Jonas. 'Are you at it again?'

'Dear Walter, remember that it is only cowards who boast. A really brave
man never talks of his bravery.'"
how-the-five-ancients-became-men,1,"Before the earth was separated from the heavens, all there was was a
great ball of watery vapor called chaos. And at that time the spirits
of the five elemental powers took shape, and became the five Ancients.
The first was called the Yellow Ancient, and he was the ruler of the
earth. The second was called the Red Lord, and he was the ruler of the
fire. The third was called the Dark Lord, and he was the ruler of the
water. The fourth was known as the Wood Prince, and he was the ruler
of the wood. The fifth was called the Mother of Metals, and ruled over
them. These five Ancients set all their primal spirit into motion, so
that water and earth sank down. The heavens floated upward, and the
earth grew firm in the depths."
how-the-five-ancients-became-men,2,"Then they allowed the waters to gather
into rivers and seas, and hills and plains made their appearance. So
the heavens opened and the earth was divided. And there were sun, moon
and all the stars, wind, clouds, rain, and dew. The Yellow Ancient set
earth's purest power spinning in a circle, and added the effect of
fire and water thereto. Then there came forth grasses and trees, birds
and beasts, and the tribes of the serpents and insects, fishes and
turtles. The Wood Prince and the Mother of Metals combined light and
darkness, and thus created the human race as men and women. And thus
the world gradually came to be."
how-the-five-ancients-became-men,3,"At that time there was one who was known as the True Prince of the
Jasper Castle. He had acquired the art of sorcery through the
cultivation of magic. The five Ancients begged him to rule as the
supreme god. He dwelt above the three and thirty heavens, and the
Jasper Castle, of white jade with golden gates, was his. Before him
stood the stewards of the eight-and-twenty houses of the moon, and the
gods of the thunders and the Great Bear, and in addition a class of
baneful gods whose influence was evil and deadly. They all aided the
True Prince of the Jasper Castle to rule over the thousand tribes
under the heavens, and to deal out life and death, fortune and
misfortune. The Lord of the Jasper Castle is now known as the Great
God, the White Jade Ruler."
how-the-five-ancients-became-men,4,"The five Ancients withdrew after they had done their work, and
thereafter lived in quiet purity. The Red Lord dwells in the South as
the god of fire. The Dark Lord dwells in the North, as the mighty
master of the somber polar skies. He lived in a castle of liquid
crystal. In later ages he sent Confucius down upon earth as a saint.
Hence this saint is known as the Son of Crystal. The Wood Prince
dwells in the East. He is honored as the Green Lord, and watches over
the coming into being of all creatures. In him lives the power of
spring and he is the god of love. The Mother of Metals dwells in the
West, by the sea of Jasper, and is also known as the Queen-Mother of
the West. She leads the rounds of the fairies, and watches over change
and growth. The Yellow Ancient dwells in the middle. He is always
going about in the world, in order to save and to help those in any
distress."
how-the-five-ancients-became-men,5,"The first time he came to earth he was the Yellow Lord, who
taught mankind all sorts of arts. In his later years he fathomed the
meaning of the world on the Ethereal Mount, and flew up to the radiant
sun. Under the rule of the Dschou dynasty he was born again as Li
Oerl, and when he was born his hair and beard were white, for which
reason he was called Laotsze, ""Old Child."" He wrote the book of
""Meaning and Life"" and spread his teachings through the world. He is
honored as the head of Taoism. At the beginning of the reign of the
Han dynasty, he again appeared as the Old Man of the River, (Ho Schang
Gung). He spread the teachings of Tao abroad mightily, so that from
that time on Taoism flourished greatly. These doctrines are known to
this day as the teachings of the Yellow Ancient. There is also a
saying: ""First Laotsze was, then the heavens were."" And that must mean
that Laotsze was that very same Yellow Ancient of primal days."
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,1,"At the time of the seven empires there lived a man by the name of Si-Men Bau, who was a governor on the Yellow River. In this district the river-god was held in high honor. The sorcerers and witches who dwelt there said: ""Every year the river-god looks for a bride, who must be selected from among the people. If she be not found then wind and rain will not come at the proper seasons. There will be scanty crops and floods!"" And then, when a girl came of age in some wealthy family, the sorcerers would say that she should be selected. Whereupon her parents, who wished to protect their daughter, would bribe them with large sums of money to look for some one else, till the sorcerers would give in. They would order the rich folk to share the expense of buying some poor girl to be cast into the river. The remainder of the money they would keep for themselves as their profit on the transaction. But whoever would not pay, their daughter was chosen to be the bride of the river-god. She was forced to accept the wedding gifts which the sorcerers brought her. The people of the district chafed grievously under this custom."
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,2,"Now when Si-Men entered into office, he heard of this evil custom. He had the sorcerers come before him. He said: ""See to it that you let me know when the day of the river-god's wedding comes. I wish to be present to honor the god! This will please him. In return he will shower blessings on my people."" With that he dismissed them. And the sorcerers were full of praise for his piety."
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,3,"So when the day arrived they gave him notice. Si-Men dressed himself in his robes of ceremony. He entered his chariot and drove to the river in festival procession. The elders of the people, as well as the sorcerers and the witches were all there. And from far and near men, women and children had flocked together in order to see the show. The sorcerers placed the river-bride on a couch. They adorned her with her bridal jewels, and kettledrums, snaredrums and merry airs vied with each other in joyful sound."
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,4,"They were about to thrust the couch into the stream. The girl's parents said farewell to her amid tears. But Si-Men bade them wait. He said: ""Do not be in such a hurry! I have appeared in person to escort the bride, hence everything must be done solemnly and in order. First some one must go to the river-god's castle. Let him know that he may come himself and fetch his bride."""
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,5,"And with these words he looked at a witch. He said: ""You may go!"" The witch hesitated, but he ordered his servants to seize her and thrust her into the stream. After which about an hour went by.

""That woman did not understand her business,"" continued Si-Men, ""or else she would have been back long ago!"" And with that he looked at one of the sorcerers. He added: ""Do you go and do better!"" The sorcerer paled with fear, but Si-Men had him seized and cast into the river. Again half-an-hour went by."
how-the-river-gods-wedding-was-broken-off,6,"Then Si-Men pretended to be uneasy. ""Both of them have made a botch of their errand,"" said he, ""and are causing the bride to wait in vain!"" Once more he looked at a sorcerer. He said: ""Do you go and hunt them up!"" But the sorcerer flung himself on the ground and begged for mercy. And all the rest of the sorcerers and witches knelt to him in a row, and pleaded for grace. And they took an oath that they would never again seek a bride for the river-god.

Then Si-Men held his hand. He sent the girl back to her home. The evil custom was at an end forever."
isle-of-udrost,1,"Once upon a time there lived at Vaero, not far from Rost, a poor
fisherman, named Isaac. He had nothing but a boat and a couple of goats,
which his wife fed as well as she could with fish leavings, and with the
grass she was able to gather on the surrounding hills. But his whole hut
was full of hungry children. Yet he was always satisfied with what God
sent him. The only thing that worried him was his inability to live at
peace with his neighbor. The latter was a rich man, thought himself
entitled to far more than such a beggarly fellow as Isaac. He wanted
to get him out of the way, in order to take for himself the anchorage
before Isaac's hut."
isle-of-udrost,2,"One day Isaac had put out a few miles to sea to fish, when suddenly a
dark fog fell. In a flash such a tremendous storm broke, that he had
to throw all his fish overboard in order to lighten ship and save his
life. Even then it was very hard to keep the boat afloat. He steered
a careful course between and across the mountainous waves, which seemed
ready to swallow him from moment to moment. After he had kept on for
five or six hours in this manner, he thought that he ought to touch
land somewhere. But time went by, and the storm and fog grew worse and
worse. Then he began to realize that either he was steering out to sea,
or that the wind had veered, and at last he made sure the latter was the
case. He sailed on and on without a sight of land."
isle-of-udrost,3,"Suddenly he heard a hideous cry from the stern of the boat, and felt certain that it was
the drang, who was singing his death-song. Then he prayed God to guard
his wife and children, for he thought his last hour had come. As he sat
there and prayed, he made out something black. When his boat drew
nearer, he noticed that it was only three cormorants, sitting on a piece
of drift-wood and--swish! he had passed them. Thus he sailed for a long
time, and grew so hungry, so thirsty and so weary that he did not know
what to do. The most part he sat with the rudder in his hand and
slept. But all of a sudden the boat ran up on a beach and stopped. Then
Isaac opened his eyes. The sun broke through the fog, and shone on a
beautiful land. Its hills and mountains were green to their very tops,
fields and meadows lay among their slopes. He seemed to breathe a
fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any he had ever known
before."
isle-of-udrost,4,"""God be praised, now I am safe, for this is Udrost!"" said Isaac to
himself. Directly ahead of him lay a field of barley, with ears so
large and heavy that he had never seen their like. Through the
barley-field a narrow path led to a green turf-roofed cottage of clay,
that rose above the field. On the roof of the cottage grazed a white
goat with gilded horns, and an udder as large as that of the largest
cow. Before the door sat a little man clad in blue, puffing away at a
little pipe. He had a beard so long and so large that it hung far down
upon his breast."
isle-of-udrost,5,"""Welcome to Udrost, Isaac!"" said the man.

""Good day to you, father,"" said Isaac, ""and do you know me?""

""It might be that I do,"" said the man. ""I suppose you want to stay here
overnight?""

""That would suit me very well, father,"" was Isaac's reply.

""The trouble is with my sons, for they cannot bear the smell of a
Christian,"" answered the man. ""Did you meet them?""

""No, I only met three cormorants, who were sitting on a piece of
drift-wood and croaking,"" was Isaac's reply.

""Well, those were my sons,"" said the man, and emptied his pipe, ""and now
come into the house, for I think you must be hungry and thirsty.""

""I'll take that liberty, father,"" said Isaac."
isle-of-udrost,6,"When the man opened the door, everything within was so beautiful that
Isaac could not get over his admiration. He had never seen anything like
it. The table was covered with the finest dishes, bowls of cream, and
salmon and game, and liver dumplings with syrup, and cheese as well, and
there were whole piles of doughnuts, and there was mead, and everything
else that is good. Isaac ate and drank bravely, and yet his plate was
never empty. No matter how much he drank, his glass was always
full. The man neither ate much nor said much; but suddenly they heard a
noise and clamor before the house, and the man went out. After a time he
returned with his three sons, and Isaac trembled inwardly when they came
through the door. Their father must have quieted them, for they were
very friendly and amiable, and told Isaac he must use his guest-right,
and sit down and drink with them; for Isaac had risen to leave the
table, saying he had satisfied his hunger. But he gave in to them, and
they drank mead together, and became good friends. And they said that
Isaac must go fishing with them, so that he would have something to take
with him when he went home."
isle-of-udrost,7,"The first time they put out a great storm was raging. One of the
sons sat at the rudder, the second at the bow, and the third in the
middle. Isaac had to work with the bailing-can until he dripped
perspiration. They sailed as though they were mad. They never reefed a
sail, and when the boat was full of water, they danced on the crests of
the waves, and slid down them so that the water in the stern spurted up
like a fountain. After a time the storm subsided, and they began to
fish. And the sea was so full of fish that they could not even put out
an anchor, since mountains of fish were piled up beneath them. The sons
of Udrost drew up one fish after another. Isaac knew his business; but
he had taken along his own fishing-tackle, and as soon as a fish bit he
let go again, and at last he had caught not a single one. When the boat
was filled, they sailed home again to Udrost, and the sons cleaned the
fish, and laid them on the stands. Meanwhile Isaac had complained to
their father of his poor luck. The man promised that he should do better
next time, and gave him a couple of hooks. The next time they went
out to fish, Isaac caught just as many as the others, and when they
reached home, he was given three stands of fish as his share."
isle-of-udrost,8,"At length Isaac began to get homesick. When he was about to leave,
the man made him a present of a new fishing-boat, full of meal, and
tackle and other useful things. Isaac thanked him repeatedly, and the
man invited him to come back when the season opened again, since he
himself was going to take a cargo to Bergen, in the second stevne,
and Isaac could go along and sell his fish there himself. Isaac was more
than willing, and asked him what course he should set when he again
wanted to reach Udrost. ""All you need do is to follow the cormorant when
he heads for the open sea, then you will be on the right course,"" said
the man. ""Good luck on your way!"""
isle-of-udrost,9,"But when Isaac got underway, and looked around, there was no Udrost in
sight. Far and wide, all around him, he saw no more than the ocean.

When the time came, Isaac sailed to join the man of Udrost's
fishing-craft. But such a craft he had never seen before. It was two
hails long, so that when the steersman, who was on look-out in the
stern, wanted to call out something to the rower, the latter could not
hear him. So they had stationed another man in the middle of the ship,
close by the mast, who had to relay the steersman's call to the rower,
and even he had to shout as loudly as he could in order to make
himself heard."
isle-of-udrost,10,"Isaac's share was laid down in the forepart of the boat; and he himself
took down the fish from the stands; yet he could not understand how it
was that the stands were continually filled with fresh fish, no matter
how many he took away, and when he sailed away they were still as full
as ever. When he reached Bergen, he sold his fish, and got so much money
for them that he was able to buy a new schooner, completely fitted out,
and with a cargo to boot, as the man of Udrost had advised him. Late in
the evening, when he was about to sail for home, the man came aboard
and told him never to forget those who survived his neighbor, for his
neighbor himself had died. Then he wished Isaac all possible success
and good fortune for his schooner, in advance. ""All is well, and all
stands firm that towers in the air,"" said he, and what he meant was that
there was one aboard whom none could see, but who would support the mast
on his back, if need be."
isle-of-udrost,11,"Since that time fortune was Isaac's friend. And well he knew why this
was so, and never forgot to prepare something good for whoever held the
winter watch, when the schooner was drawn up on land in the fall. And
every Christmas night there was the glow and shimmer of light, the
sound of fiddles and music, of laughter and merriment, and of dancing on
the deserted schooner."
jack-my-hedgehog,1,"There was once a farmer who lived in great comfort. He had both lands
and money, but, though he was so well off, one thing was wanting to
complete his happiness; he had no children. Many and many a time, when
he met other farmers at the nearest market town, they would teaze him,
asking how it came about that he was childless. At length he grew so
angry that he exclaimed: 'I must and will have a child of some sort or
kind, even should it only be a hedgehog!'

Not long after this his wife gave birth to a child, but though the lower
half of the little creature was a fine boy, from the waist upwards it
was a hedgehog, so that when his mother first saw him she was quite
frightened, and said to her husband, 'There now, you have cursed the
child yourself.' The farmer said, 'What's the use of making a fuss? I
suppose the creature must be christened, but I don't see how we are to
ask anyone to be sponsor to him, and what are we to call him?'

'There is nothing we can possibly call him but Jack my Hedgehog,'
replied the wife."
jack-my-hedgehog,2,"So they took him to be christened, and the parson said: 'You'll never
be able to put that child in a decent bed on account of his prickles.'
Which was true, but they shook down some straw for him behind the stove,
and there he lay for eight years. His father grew very tired of him and
often wished him dead, but he did not die, but lay on there year after
year.

Now one day there was a big fair at the market town to which the farmer
meant to go, so he asked his wife what he should bring her from it.
'Some meat and a couple of big loaves for the house,' said she. Then he
asked the maid what she wanted, and she said a pair of slippers and some
stockings. Lastly he said, 'Well, Jack my Hedgehog, and what shall I
bring you?'

'Daddy,' said he, 'do bring me a bagpipe.' When the farmer came home he
gave his wife and the maid the things they had asked for, and then he
went behind the stove and gave Jack my Hedgehog the bagpipes."
jack-my-hedgehog,3,"When Jack had got his bagpipes he said, 'Daddy, do go to the smithy and
have the house cock shod for me; then I'll ride off and trouble you no
more.' His father, who was delighted at the prospect of getting rid of
him, had the cock shod, and when it was ready Jack my Hedgehog mounted
on its back and rode off to the forest, followed by all the pigs and
asses which he had promised to look after.

Having reached the forest he made the cock fly up to the top of a very
tall tree with him, and there he sat looking after his pigs and donkeys,
and he sat on and on for several years till he had quite a big herd; but
all this time his father knew nothing about him."
jack-my-hedgehog,4,"As he sat up in his tree he played away on his pipes and drew the
loveliest music from them. As he was playing one day a King, who had
lost his way, happened to pass close by, and hearing the music he was
much surprised, and sent one of his servants to find out where it
came from. The man peered about, but he could see nothing but a little
creature which looked like a cock with a hedgehog sitting on it, perched
up in a tree. The King desired the servant to ask the strange creature
why it sat there, and if it knew the shortest way to his kingdom.

On this Jack my Hedgehog stepped down from his tree and said he would
undertake to show the King his way home if the King on his part would
give him his written promise to let him have whatever first met him on
his return.

The King thought to himself, 'That's easy enough to promise. The
creature won't understand a word about it, so I can just write what I
choose.'"
jack-my-hedgehog,5,"So he took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done Jack my
Hedgehog pointed out the way and the King got safely home.

Now when the King's daughter saw her father returning in the distance
she was so delighted that she ran to meet him and threw herself into
his arms. Then the King remembered Jack my Hedgehog, and he told his
daughter how he had been obliged to give a written promise to bestow
whatever he first met when he got home on an extraordinary creature
which had shown him the way. The creature, said he, rode on a cock
as though it had been a horse, and it made lovely music, but as it
certainly could not read he had just written that he would _not_ give
it anything at all. At this the Princess was quite pleased, and said how
cleverly her father had managed, for that of course nothing would induce
her to have gone off with Jack my Hedgehog."
jack-my-hedgehog,6,"Meantime Jack minded his asses and pigs, sat aloft in his tree, played
his bagpipes, and was always merry and cheery. After a time it so
happened that another King, having lost his way, passed by with his
servants and escort, wondering how he could find his way home, for the
forest was very vast. He too heard the music, and told one of his men to
find out whence it came. The man came under the tree, and looking up to
the top there he saw Jack my Hedgehog astride on the cock.

The servant asked Jack what he was doing up there. 'I'm minding my pigs
and donkeys; but what do you want?' was the reply. Then the servant told
him they had lost their way, and wanted some one to show it them. Down
came Jack my Hedgehog with his cock, and told the old King he would show
him the right way if he would solemnly promise to give him the first
thing he met in front of his royal castle.

The King said 'Yes,' and gave Jack a written promise to that effect."
jack-my-hedgehog,7,"Then Jack rode on in front pointing out the way, and the King reached
his own country in safety.

Now he had an only daughter who was extremely beautiful, and who,
delighted at her father's return, ran to meet him, threw her arms round
his neck and kissed him heartily. Then she asked where he had been
wandering so long, and he told her how he had lost his way and might
never have reached home at all but for a strange creature, half-man,
half-hedgehog, which rode a cock and sat up in a tree making lovely
music, and which had shown him the right way. He also told her how he
had been obliged to pledge his word to give the creature the first
thing which met him outside his castle gate, and he felt very sad at the
thought that she had been the first thing to meet him.

But the Princess comforted him, and said she should be quite willing to
go with Jack my Hedgehog whenever he came to fetch her, because of the
great love she bore to her dear old father."
jack-my-hedgehog,8,"Jack my Hedgehog continued to herd his pigs, and they increased in
number till there were so many that the forest seemed full of them. So
he made up his mind to live there no longer, and sent a message to his
father telling him to have all the stables and outhouses in the village
cleared, as he was going to bring such an enormous herd that all who
would might kill what they chose. His father was much vexed at this
news, for he thought Jack had died long ago. Jack my Hedgehog mounted
his cock, and driving his pigs before him into the village, he let every
one kill as many as they chose, and such a hacking and hewing of pork
went on as you might have heard for miles off.

Then said Jack, 'Daddy, let the blacksmith shoe my cock once more; then
I'll ride off, and I promise you I'll never come back again as long as
I live.' So the father had the cock shod, and rejoiced at the idea of
getting rid of his son."
jack-my-hedgehog,9,"Then Jack my Hedgehog set off for the first kingdom, and there the King
had given strict orders that if anyone should be seen riding a cock
and carrying a bagpipe he was to be chased away and shot at, and on no
account to be allowed to enter the palace. So when Jack my Hedgehog rode
up the guards charged him with their bayonets, but he put spurs to his
cock, flew up over the gate right to the King's windows, let himself
down on the sill, and called out that if he was not given what had been
promised him, both the King and his daughter should pay for it with
their lives. Then the King coaxed and entreated his daughter to go with
Jack and so save both their lives.

The Princess dressed herself all in white, and her father gave her a
coach with six horses and servants in gorgeous liveries and quantities
of money. She stepped into the coach, and Jack my Hedgehog with his cock
and pipes took his place beside her. They both took leave, and the King
fully expected never to set eyes on them again. But matters turned out
very differently from what he had expected, for when they had got
a certain distance from the town Jack tore all the Princess's smart
clothes off her, and pricked her all over with his bristles, saying:
'That's what you get for treachery. Now go back, I'll have no more to
say to you.' And with that he hunted her home, and she felt she had been
disgraced and put to shame till her life's end."
jack-my-hedgehog,10,"Then Jack my Hedgehog rode on with his cock and bagpipes to the country
of the second King to whom he had shown the way. Now this King had given
orders that, in the event of Jack's coming the guards were to present
arms, the people to cheer, and he was to be conducted in triumph to the
royal palace.

When the King's daughter saw Jack my Hedgehog, she was a good deal
startled, for he certainly was very peculiar looking; but after all she
considered that she had given her word and it couldn't be helped. So she
made Jack welcome and they were betrothed to each other, and at dinner
he sat next her at the royal table, and they ate and drank together."
jack-my-hedgehog,11,"When they retired to rest the Princess feared lest Jack should kiss her
because of his prickles, but he told her not to be alarmed as no harm
should befall her. Then he begged the old King to place a watch of four
men just outside his bedroom door, and to desire them to make a big
fire. When he was about to lie down in bed he would creep out of his
hedgehog skin, and leave it lying at the bedside; then the men must
rush in, throw the skin into the fire, and stand by till it was entirely
burnt up.

And so it was, for when it struck eleven, Jack my Hedgehog went to his
room, took off his skin and left it at the foot of the bed. The men
rushed in, quickly seized the skin and threw it on the fire, and
directly it was all burnt Jack was released from his enchantment and
lay in his bed a man from head to foot, but quite black as though he had
been severely scorched."
jack-my-hedgehog,12,"The King sent off for his physician in ordinary, who washed Jack all
over with various essences and salves, so that he became white and was a
remarkably handsome young man. When the King's daughter saw him she was
greatly pleased, and next day the marriage ceremony was performed, and
the old King bestowed his kingdom on Jack my Hedgehog.

After some years Jack and his wife went to visit his father, but the
farmer did not recognize him, and declared he had no son; he had had
one, but that one was born with bristles like a hedgehog, and had gone
off into the wide world. Then Jack told his story, and his old father
rejoiced and returned to live with him in his kingdom."
king-kojata,1,"There was once upon a time a king called Kojata, whose beard was so
long that it reached below his knees. Three years had passed since his
marriage, and he lived very happily with his wife, but Heaven granted
him no heir, which grieved the King greatly. One day he set forth
from his capital, in order to make a journey through his kingdom.
He travelled for nearly a year through the different parts of his
territory, and then, having seen all there was to be seen, he set forth
on his homeward way. As the day was very hot and sultry he commanded his
servants to pitch tents in the open field, and there await the cool of
the evening. Suddenly a frightful thirst seized the King, and as he saw
no water near, he mounted his horse, and rode through the neighbourhood
looking for a spring. Before long he came to a well filled to the brim
with water clear as crystal, and on the bosom of which a golden jug was
floating. King Kojata at once tried to seize the vessel, but though he
endeavoured to grasp it with his right hand, and then with his left, the
wretched thing always eluded his efforts and refused to let itself be
caught. First with one hand, and then with two, did the King try to
seize it, but like a fish the goblet always slipped through his fingers
and bobbed to the ground only to reappear at some other place, and mock
the King."
king-kojata,2,"'Plague on you!' said King Kojata. 'I can quench my thirst without you,'
and bending over the well he lapped up the water so greedily that he
plunged his face, beard and all, right into the crystal mirror. But when
he had satisfied his thirst, and wished to raise himself up, he couldn't
lift his head, because someone held his beard fast in the water. 'Who's
there? let me go!' cried King Kojata, but there was no answer; only an
awful face looked up from the bottom of the well with two great green
eyes, glowing like emeralds, and a wide mouth reaching from ear to ear
showing two rows of gleaming white teeth, and the King's beard was held,
not by mortal hands, but by two claws. At last a hoarse voice sounded
from the depths. 'Your trouble is all in vain, King Kojata; I will only
let you go on condition that you give me something you know nothing
about, and which you will find on your return home.'

The King didn't pause to ponder long, 'for what,' thought he, 'could be
in my palace without my knowing about it--the thing is absurd;' so he
answered quickly:

'Yes, I promise that you shall have it.'

The voice replied, 'Very well; but it will go ill with you if you fail
to keep your promise.' Then the claws relaxed their hold, and the face
disappeared in the depths. The King drew his chin out of the water,
and shook himself like a dog; then he mounted his horse and rode
thoughtfully home with his retinue."
king-kojata,3,"When they approached the capital, all the people came out to meet them with great joy and acclamation,
and when the King reached his palace the Queen met him on the threshold;
beside her stood the Prime Minister, holding a little cradle in his
hands, in which lay a new-born child as beautiful as the day. Then
the whole thing dawned on the King, and groaning deeply he muttered to
himself 'So this is what I did not know about,' and the tears rolled
down his cheeks. All the courtiers standing round were much amazed at
the King's grief, but no one dared to ask him the cause of it. He took
the child in his arms and kissed it tenderly; then laying it in its
cradle, he determined to control his emotion and began to reign again as
before.

The secret of the King remained a secret, though his grave, careworn
expression escaped no one's notice. In the constant dread that his child
would be taken from him, poor Kojata knew no rest night or day. However,
time went on and nothing happened. Days and months and years passed, and
the Prince grew up into a beautiful youth, and at last the King himself
forgot all about the incident that had happened so long ago."
king-kojata,4,"One day the Prince went out hunting, and going in pursuit of a wild boar
he soon lost the other huntsmen, and found himself quite alone in the
middle of a dark wood. The trees grew so thick and near together that it
was almost impossible to see through them, only straight in front of
him lay a little patch of meadowland. Overgrown with thistles and rank
weeds, in the centre of which a leafy lime tree reared itself.
Suddenly a rustling sound was heard in the hollow of the tree, and an
extraordinary old man with green eyes and chin crept out of it.

'A fine day, Prince Milan,' he said; 'you've kept me waiting a good
number of years; it was high time for you to come and pay me a visit.'

'Who are you, in the name of wonder?' demanded the astonished Prince.

'You'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime do as I bid you. Greet
your father King Kojata from me, and don't forget to remind him of his
debt; the time has long passed since it was due, but now he will have to
pay it. Farewell for the present; we shall meet again.'

With these words the old man disappeared into the tree, and the Prince
returned home rather startled, and told his father all that he had seen
and heard.

The King grew as white as a sheet when he heard the Prince's story, and
said, 'Woe is me, my son! The time has come when we must part,' and with
a heavy heart he told the Prince what had happened at the time of his
birth."
king-kojata,5,"'Don't worry or distress yourself, dear father,' answered Prince Milan.
'Things are never as bad as they look. Only give me a horse for my
journey, and I wager you'll soon see me back again.'

The King gave him a beautiful charger, with golden stirrups, and a
sword. The Queen hung a little cross round his neck, and after much
weeping and lamentation the Prince bade them all farewell and set forth
on his journey.

He rode straight on for two days, and on the third he came to a lake as
smooth as glass and as clear as crystal. Not a breath of wind moved, not
a leaf stirred, all was silent as the grave, only on the still bosom of
the lake thirty ducks, with brilliant plumage, swam about in the water.
Not far from the shore Prince Milan noticed thirty little white garments
lying on the grass, and dismounting from his horse, he crept down under
the high bulrushes, took one of the garments and hid himself with it
behind the bushes which grew round the lake. The ducks swam about all
over the place, dived down into the depths and rose again and glided
through the waves. At last, tired of disporting themselves, they swam
to the shore, and twenty-nine of them put on their little white garments
and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens. Then they finished
dressing and disappeared. Only the thirtieth little duck couldn't
come to the land; it swam about close to the shore, and, giving out a
piercing cry, it stretched its neck up timidly, gazed wildly around, and
then dived under again."
king-kojata,6,"Prince Milan's heart was so moved with pity for
the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes, to
see if he could be of any help. As soon as the duck perceived him, it
cried in a human voice, 'Oh, dear Prince Milan, for the love of Heaven
give me back my garment, and I will be so grateful to you.' The Prince
lay the little garment on the bank beside her, and stepped back into the
bushes. In a few seconds a beautiful girl in a white robe stood before
him, so fair and sweet and young that no pen could describe her. She
gave the Prince her hand and spoke.

'Many thanks, Prince Milan, for your courtesy. I am the daughter of a
wicked magician, and my name is Hyacinthia. My father has thirty young
daughters, and is a mighty ruler in the underworld, with many castles
and great riches. He has been expecting you for ages, but you need have
no fear if you will only follow my advice. As soon as you come into the
presence of my father, throw yourself at once on the ground and approach
him on your knees. Don't mind if he stamps furiously with his feet and
curses and swears. I'll attend to the rest, and in the meantime we had
better be off.'

With these words the beautiful Hyacinthia stamped on the ground with her
little foot, and the earth opened and they both sank down into the lower
world."
king-kojata,7,"The palace of the Magician was all hewn out of a single carbuncle,
lighting up the whole surrounding region, and Prince Milan walked into
it gaily.

The Magician sat on a throne, a sparkling crown on his head; his eyes
blazed like a green fire, and instead of hands he had claws. As soon as
Prince Milan entered he flung himself on his knees. The Magician stamped
loudly with his feet, glared frightfully out of his green eyes, and
cursed so loudly that the whole underworld shook. But the Prince,
mindful of the counsel he had been given, wasn't the least afraid, and
approached the throne still on his knees. At last the Magician laughed
aloud and said, 'You rogue, you have been well advised to make me laugh;
I won't be your enemy any more. Welcome to the underworld! All the same,
for your delay in coming here, we must demand three services from you.
For to-day you may go, but to-morrow I shall have something more to say
to you.'

Then two servants led Prince Milan to a beautiful apartment, and he lay
down fearlessly on the soft bed that had been prepared for him, and was
soon fast asleep.

Early the next morning the Magician sent for him, and said, 'Let's see
now what you've learnt. In the first place you must build me a palace
to-night, the roof of purest gold, the walls of marble, and the
windows of crystal; all round you must lay out a beautiful garden, with
fish-ponds and artistic waterfalls. If you do all this, I will reward
you richly; but if you don't, you shall lose your head.'"
king-kojata,8,"'Oh, you wicked monster!' thought Prince Milan, 'you might as well have
put me to death at once.' Sadly he returned to his room, and with bent
head sat brooding over his cruel fate till evening. When it grew dark, a
little bee flew by, and knocking at the window, it said, 'Open, and let
me in.'

Milan opened the window quickly, and as soon as the bee had entered, it
changed into the beautiful Hyacinthia.

'Good evening, Prince Milan. Why are you so sad?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father threatens me with death, and I
see myself already without a head.'

'And what have you made up your mind to do?'

'There's nothing to be done, and after all I suppose one can only die
once.'"
king-kojata,9,"'Now, don't be so foolish, my dear Prince; but keep up your spirits, for
there is no need to despair. Go to bed, and when you wake up to-morrow
morning the palace will be finished. Then you must go all round it,
giving a tap here and there on the walls to look as if you had just
finished it.'

And so it all turned out just as she had said. As soon as it was
daylight Prince Milan stepped out of his room, and found a palace which
was quite a work of art down to the very smallest detail. The Magician
himself was not a little astonished at its beauty, and could hardly
believe his eyes.

'Well, you certainly are a splendid workman,' he said to the Prince.
'I see you are very clever with your hands, now I must see if you are
equally accomplished with your head. I have thirty daughters in my
house, all beautiful princesses. To-morrow I will place the whole thirty
in a row. You must walk past them three times, and the third time you
must show me which is my youngest daughter Hyacinthia. If you don't
guess rightly, you shall lose your head.'"
king-kojata,10,"'This time you've made a mistake,' thought Prince Milan, and going to
his room he sat down at the window. 'Just fancy my not recognising the
beautiful Hyacinthia! Why, that is the easiest thing in the world.'

'Not so easy as you think,' cried the little bee, who was flying past.
'If I weren't to help you, you'd never guess. We are thirty sisters so
exactly alike that our own father can hardly distinguish us apart.'

'Then what am I to do?' asked Prince Milan.

'Listen,' answered Hyacinthia. 'You will recognise me by a tiny fly I
shall have on my left cheek, but be careful for you might easily make a
mistake.'"
king-kojata,11,"The next day the Magician again commanded Prince Milan to be led before
him. His daughters were all arranged in a straight row in front of him,
dressed exactly alike, and with their eyes bent on the ground.

'Now, you genius,' said the Magician, 'look at these beauties three
times, and then tell us which is the Princess Hyacinthia.'

Prince Milan went past them and looked at them closely. But they were
all so precisely alike that they looked like one face reflected in
thirty mirrors, and the fly was nowhere to be seen; the second time
he passed them he still saw nothing; but the third time he perceived a
little fly stealing down one cheek, causing it to blush a faint pink.
Then the Prince seized the girl's hand and cried out, 'This is the
Princess Hyacinthia!'

'You're right again,' said the Magician in amazement; 'but I've still
another task for you to do. Before this candle, which I shall light,
burns to the socket, you must have made me a pair of boots reaching to
my knees. If they aren't finished in that time, off comes your head.'"
king-kojata,12,"The Prince returned to his room in despair; then the Princess Hyacinthia
came to him once more changed into the likeness of a bee, and asked him,
'Why so sad, Prince Milan?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father has set me this time an
impossible task. Before a candle which he has lit burns to the socket,
I am to make a pair of boots. But what does a prince know of shoemaking?
If I can't do it, I lose my head.'

'And what do you mean to do?' asked Hyacinthia.

'Well, what is there to be done? What he demands I can't and won't do,
so he must just make an end of me.'

'Not so, dearest. I love you dearly, and you shall marry me, and I'll
either save your life or die with you. We must fly now as quickly as we
can, for there is no other way of escape.'

With these words she breathed on the window, and her breath froze on the
pane. Then she led Milan out of the room with her, shut the door, and
threw the key away. Hand in hand, they hurried to the spot where they
had descended into the lower world, and at last reached the banks of the
lake. Prince Milan's charger was still grazing on the grass which grew
near the water. The horse no sooner recognized his master, than it
neighed loudly with joy, and springing towards him, it stood as if
rooted to the ground, while Prince Milan and Hyacinthia jumped on its
back. Then it sped onwards like an arrow from a bow."
king-kojata,13,"In the meantime the Magician was waiting impatiently for the Prince.
Enraged by the delay, he sent his servants to fetch him, for the
appointed time was past.

The servants came to the door, and finding it locked, they knocked; but
the frozen breath on the window replied in Prince Milan's voice, 'I am
coming directly.' With this answer they returned to the Magician. But
when the Prince still did not appear, after a time he sent his servants
a second time to bring him. The frozen breath always gave the same
answer, but the Prince never came. At last the Magician lost all
patience, and commanded the door to be burst open. But when his servants
did so, they found the room empty, and the frozen breath laughed
aloud. Out of his mind with rage, the Magician ordered the Prince to be
pursued."
king-kojata,14,"Then a wild chase began. 'I hear horses' hoofs behind us,' said
Hyacinthia to the Prince. Milan sprang from the saddle, put his ear to
the ground and listened. 'Yes,' he answered, 'they are pursuing us, and
are quite close.' 'Then no time must be lost,' said Hyacinthia, and
she immediately turned herself into a river, Prince Milan into an iron
bridge, and the charger into a blackbird. Behind the bridge the road
branched off into three ways.

The Magician's servants hurried after the fresh tracks, but when they
came to the bridge, they stood, not knowing which road to take, as the
footprints stopped suddenly, and there were three paths for them to
choose from. In fear and trembling they returned to tell the Magician
what had happened. He flew into a dreadful rage when he saw them, and
screamed out, 'Oh, you fools! the river and bridge were they! Go back
and bring them to me at once, or it will be the worse for you.'"
king-kojata,15,"Then the pursuit began afresh. 'I hear horses' hoofs,' sighed
Hyacinthia. The Prince dismounted and put his ear to the ground. 'They
are hurrying after us, and are already quite near.' In a moment the
Princess Hyacinthia had changed herself, the Prince, and his charger
into a thick wood where a thousand paths and roads crossed each other.
Their pursuers entered the forest, but searched in vain for Prince Milan
and his bride. At last they found themselves back at the same spot they
had started from, and in despair they returned once more with empty
hands to the Magician.

'Then I'll go after the wretches myself,' he shouted. 'Bring a horse at
once; they shan't escape me.'

Once more the beautiful Hyacinthia murmured, 'I hear horses' hoofs quite
near.' And the Prince answered, 'They are pursuing us hotly and are
quite close.'

'We are lost now, for that is my father himself. But at the first church
we come to his power ceases; he may chase us no further. Hand me your
cross.'

Prince Milan loosened from his neck the little gold cross his mother had
given him, and as soon as Hyacinthia grasped it, she had changed herself
into a church, Milan into a monk, and the horse into a belfry. They had
hardly done this when the magician and his servants rode up.

'Did you see no one pass by on horseback, reverend father?' he asked the
monk.

'Prince Milan and Princess Hyacinthia have just gone on this minute;
they stopped for a few minutes in the church to say their prayers, and
bade me light this wax candle for you, and give you their love.'"
king-kojata,16,"'I'd like to wring their necks,' said the magician, and made all haste
home, where he had every one of his servants beaten to within an inch of
their lives.

Prince Milan rode on slowly with his bride without fearing any further
pursuit. The sun was just setting, and its last rays lit up a large city
they were approaching. Prince Milan was suddenly seized with an ardent
desire to enter the town.

'Oh my beloved,' implored Hyacinthia, 'please don't go; for I am
frightened and fear some evil.'

'What are you afraid of?' asked the Prince. 'We'll only go and look at
what's to be seen in the town for about an hour, and then we'll continue
our journey to my father's kingdom.'"
king-kojata,17,"'The town is easy to get into, but more difficult to get out of,' sighed
Hyacinthia. 'But let it be as you wish. Go, and I will await you here,
but I will first change myself into a white milestone; only I pray you
be very careful. The King and Queen of the town will come out to meet
you, leading a little child with them. Whatever you do, don't kiss the
child, or you will forget me and all that has happened to us. I will
wait for you here for three days.'

The Prince hurried to the town, but Hyacinthia remained behind disguised
as a white milestone on the road. The first day passed, and then the
second, and at last the third also, but Prince Milan did not return,
for he had not taken Hyacinthia's advice. The King and Queen came out to
meet him as she had said, leading with them a lovely fair-haired little
girl, whose eyes shone like two clear stars. The child at once caressed
the Prince, who, carried away by its beauty, bent down and kissed it on
the cheek. From that moment his memory became a blank, and he forgot all
about the beautiful Hyacinthia."
king-kojata,18,"When the Prince did not return, poor Hyacinthia wept bitterly and
changing herself from a milestone into a little blue field flower, she
said, 'I will grow here on the wayside till some passer-by tramples me
under foot.' And one of her tears remained as a dewdrop and sparkled on
the little blue flower.

Now it happened shortly after this that an old man passed by, and seeing
the flower, he was delighted with its beauty. He pulled it up carefully
by the roots and carried it home. Here he planted it in a pot, and
watered and tended the little plant carefully. And now the most
extraordinary thing happened, for from this moment everything in the old
man's house was changed. When he awoke in the morning he always found
his room tidied and put into such beautiful order that not a speck of
dust was to be found anywhere. When he came home at midday, he found a
table laid out with the most dainty food, and he had only to sit down
and enjoy himself to his heart's content. At first he was so surprised
he didn't know what to think, but after a time he grew a little
uncomfortable, and went to an old witch to ask for advice.

The witch said, 'Get up before the cock crows, and watch carefully till
you see something move, and then throw this cloth quickly over it, and
you'll see what will happen.'"
king-kojata,19,"All night the old man never closed an eye. When the first ray of light
entered the room, he noticed that the little blue flower began to
tremble, and at last it rose out of the pot and flew about the room,
put everything in order, swept away the dust, and lit the fire. In great
haste the old man sprang from his bed, and covered the flower with
the cloth the old witch had given him, and in a moment the beautiful
Princess Hyacinthia stood before him.

'What have you done?' she cried. 'Why have you called me back to life?
For I have no desire to live since my bridegroom, the beautiful Prince
Milan, has deserted me.'

'Prince Milan is just going to be married,' replied the old man.
'Everything is being got ready for the feast, and all the invited guests
are flocking to the palace from all sides.'

The beautiful Hyacinthia cried bitterly when she heard this; then she
dried her tears, and went into the town dressed as a peasant woman. She
went straight to the King's kitchen, where the white-aproned cooks were
running about in great confusion. The Princess went up to the head cook,
and said, 'Dear cook, please listen to my request, and let me make a
wedding-cake for Prince Milan.'

The busy cook was just going to refuse her demand and order her out of
the kitchen, but the words died on his lips when he turned and beheld
the beautiful Hyacinthia, and he answered politely, 'You have just come
in the nick of time, fair maiden. Bake your cake, and I myself will lay
it before Prince Milan.'"
king-kojata,20,"The cake was soon made. The invited guests were already thronging round
the table, when the head cook entered the room, bearing a beautiful
wedding cake on a silver dish, and laid it before Prince Milan. The
guests were all lost in admiration, for the cake was quite a work of
art. Prince Milan at once proceeded to cut it open, when to his surprise
two white doves sprang out of it, and one of them said to the other: 'My
dear mate, do not fly away and leave me, and forget me as Prince Milan
forgot his beloved Hyacinthia.'

Milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said. Then he
jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door, where he found
the beautiful Hyacinthia waiting for him. Outside stood his faithful
charger, pawing the ground. Without pausing for a moment, Milan and
Hyacinthia mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the
country of King Kojata. The King and Queen received them with such
joy and gladness as had never been heard of before, and they all lived
happily for the rest of their lives."
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,1,"There was once a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in
the old ancient times, long ago. It was him that owned the Churches
in the early days.

""Surely,"" said I, ""the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?""

""Oh, by no means, your honor--truth, it's yourself that's right enough
there. But you know the place is called 'The Churches' because they were
built after by St. Kavin, and went by the name of the Churches ever
more. Therefore, of course, the place bein' so called, I say that
the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' it was his
birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood? Well, the King (you see)
was the right sort--he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved
his life, and huntin' in particular. From the risin' o' the sun up
he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and
the fine times them were. The deer was as plenty thin, aye truth,
far more plentiful than the sheep is now. That's the way it was with the
King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast."""
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,2,"Well, it
was all mighty good as long as the King had his health. But, you see, in
coorse o' time, the King grew old, by reason he was stiff in his
limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. He
was lost entirely for want o' diversions, because he couldn't go a huntin'
no longer. By dad, the poor King was obliged at last for to get a
goose to distract him. You see, the goose used for to swim across the
lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland
than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King. If flew
every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor King that you'd
think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his
goose. So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the
country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end.
The poor King was as happy as the day was long. So that's the way it
was. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken
in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her
master, and couldn't distract him no longer. Then it was that the
poor King was lost completely, and didn't know what in the wide world to
do. He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was
no more in the flower of her blume.

Well, the King was nigh broken-hearted and melancholy entirely, and was
walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate,
an' thinkin' o' drownin' himself, that could get no diversion in life,
when all of a sudden, turnin' round the corner beyond, who should he
meet but a mighty decent young man comin' up to him."
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,3,"'God save you,' says the King (for the King was a civil-spoken
gentleman, by all accounts), 'God save you,' says he to the young man.

'God save you kindly,' says the young man to him back again. 'God save
you, King O'Toole.'

'True for you,' says the King, 'I am King O'Toole,' says he. 'Prince
and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he. 'But how came you to
know that?' says he.

'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin (for 'twas he that was in it). 'And
now, may I make bold to ask, how is your goose, King O'Toole?' says he.

'Blur-an-agers, how came you to know about my goose?' says the King.

'Oh, no mather. I was given to understand it,' says Saint Kavin.

'Oh, that's a folly to talk,' says the King, 'because myself and my
goose is private friends,' says he, 'and no one could tell you,' says
he, 'barrin' the fairies.'

'Oh, then, it wasn't the fairies,' says Saint Kavin. 'For I'd have you
know,' says he, 'that I don't keep the likes o' such company.'

'You might do worse, then, my gay fellow,' says the King. 'For it's
they could show you a crock o' money as easy as kiss hand. And that's
not to be sneezed at,' says the King, 'by a poor man,' says he.

'Maybe I've a better way of making money myself,' says the saint.

'By gor,' says the King, 'barrin' you're a coiner,' says he, 'that's
impossible!'

'I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!' says Saint Kavin, mighty high,
'I'd scorn to be the like,' says he.

'Then, what are you?' says the King, 'that makes money so easy, by your
own account.'

'I'm an honest man,' says Saint Kavin."
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,4,"'Well, honest man,' says the King, 'and how is it you make your money
so easy?'

'By makin' old things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin.

'Is it a tinker you are?' says the King.

'No,' says the saint; 'I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole. I've a
better thrade than a tinker,' says he. 'What would you say,' says he,
'if I made your old goose as good as new?'

'My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think
the poor old King's eyes was ready to jump out of his head.' 'And,' says
he--'truth, then, I'd give you more money nor you could count,' says
he, 'if you did the like, and I'd be beholden to you in the bargain.'

'I scorn your dirty money,' says Saint Kavin.

'Faith, then, I'm thinkin' a trifle o' change would do you no harm,'
says the King, lookin' up sly at the old hat that Saint Kavin had
on him.

'I have a vow agin it,' says the saint. 'I am book sworn,' says he,
'never to have gold, silver, or brass in my company.'

'Barrin' the trifle you can't help,' says the King, mighty cute, and
looking him straight in the face.

'You just hot it,' says Saint Kavin. 'But though I can't take money,'
says he, 'I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me.'

'With all the veins o' my heart,' says the King, 'if you can do what
you say.'

'Try me!' says Saint Kavin. 'Call down your goose here,' says he, 'and
I'll see what I can do for her.'"
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,5,"With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, all as one as
a hound, waddlin' up to the poor old cripple, her master, and as like
him as two pays. The minute the saint set his eyes on the goose, 'I'll
do the job for you,' says he, 'King O'Toole!'

'By Jaminee,' says King O'Toole, 'if you do, but I'll say you're the
cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.'

'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must say more nor that--my horn's
not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your old goose for
nothin'. 'What'll you give me if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,'
says Saint Kavin.

'I'll give you whatever you ask,' says the King. 'isn't that fair?'

'Devil a fairer,' says the saint. 'That's the way to do business. Now,'
says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you
give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I
make her as good as new?'

'I will,' says the King.

'You won't go back o' your word?' says Saint Kavin.

'Honor bright!' says King O'Toole, holdin' out his fist.

'Honor bright,' says Saint Kavin back again, 'it's a bargain,' says he.
'Come here!' says he to the poor old goose--'come here, you
unfortunate old cripple,' says he, 'and it's I that'll make you the
sportin' bird.'"
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,6,"'With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings--criss o' my
cross an you,' says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at
the same minute. And throwin' her up in the air, 'whew!' says he, just
givin' her a blast to help her. With that, my jewel, she took to her
heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cuttin' as many
capers as a swallow before a shower of rain. Away she went down there,
right in front of you, along the side o' the cliff, and flew over Saint
Kavin's bed (that is, where Saint Kavin's bed is now, but was not
then, by reason as it wasn't made, but was contrived after by Saint
Kavin himself, that the women might leave him alone). And on with her
under Lugduff, and round the end of the lake there, far beyond where
you see the waterfall. And on with her then right over the lead mines
o' Luganure (that is, where the lead mines is now, but was not then,
by reason they weren't discovered, but was all gold in Saint Kavin's
time). Well, over the end o' Luganure she flew, stout and studdy, and
round the other end of the little lake, by the Churches (that is, of course, where the Churches is now, but was not then, by reason they
were not built, but afterwards by Saint Kavin), and over the big hill
here over your head, where you see the big cliff--(and that cliff in the
mountain was made by Finn Ma Cool, where he cut it across with a big
sword that he got made a purpose by a blacksmith out o' Rathdrum, a
cousin of his own, for to fight a giant that dared him an' the
Curragh o' Kildare. He tried the sword first an the mountain, and
cut it down into a gap, as is plain to this day. Faith, sure enough,
it's the same sauce he served the giant, soon and sudden, and chopped
him in two like a potato, for the glory of his soul and old
Ireland)--well, down she flew over the cliff, and flutterin' over the
wood there at Poulanass."
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,7,"'Well--as I said--afther flutterin' over the
wood a little bit, to plaze herself, the goose flew down, and bit at
the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his
dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch.'

'Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with
his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a
lark, and better nor ever she was. When she let at his foot he
patted her an the head, and ma vourneen,' says he, 'but you are the
darling o' the world.'

'And what do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin, 'for makin' her the
like?'

'By gor,' says the King, ""I say nothin' about the art o' men, barrin'
the bees.""

'And do you say no more nor that?' says Saint Kavin.

'And that I'm beholden to you,' says the King.

'But will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?' says Saint
Kavin.

'I will,' says King O'Toole, 'and you're welcome to it,' says he,
'though it's the last acre I have to give.'

'But you'll keep your word true?' says the saint.

'As true as the sun,' says the King."
king-o-toole-and-st-kevin,8,"'It's well for you,' says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp--'it's well for
you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he. 'For if you didn't
say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly
again,' says Saint Kavin.

'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling
you.'

Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased
with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King.

""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into
the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual
acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret
by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old
King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him.
He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the
poor old King was doatin' , you see), and the King had his goose as
good as new to distract him as long as he lived. The saint supported
him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of
his death--and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was
catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he
made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! and, by gor,
instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the
eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him. But he didn't ate
her, because he doesn't eat what Saint Kavin laid his blessed hands on."""
kings-hares,1,"Once upon a time there was a man who lived in the little back room. He
had given up his estate to the heir. But in addition he had three sons,
who were named Peter, Paul and Esben, who was the youngest. All three
hung around at home and would not work, for they had it too easy.
They thought themselves too good for anything like work, and nothing was good enough for them. Finally Peter once heard that the king wanted a shepherd for his hares, and he told his father he would apply for the
position, as it would just suit him, seeing that he wished to serve no
one lower in rank than the king. His father, it is true, was of the
opinion that there might be other work that would suit him better, for
whoever was to herd hares would have to be quick and spry, and not a
sleepy-head. When the hares took to their heels in all directions,
it was a dance of another kind than when one skipped about a room. But
it was of no use. Peter insisted, and would have his own way, took his
knapsack, and shambled down hill. After he had gone a while, he saw an
old woman who had got her nose wedged in a tree-stump while chopping
wood, and when Peter saw her jerking and pulling away, trying to get
out, he burst into loud laughter."
kings-hares,2,"""Don't stand there and laugh in such a stupid way,"" said the woman,
""but come and help a poor, feeble old woman. I wanted to split up some
fire-wood, and caught my nose here. Here I have been standing for
more than a hundred years, pulling and jerking, without a bit of bread
to chew in all that time,"" said she.

Then Peter had to laugh all the harder. He found it all very amusing,
and said that if she had already been standing there a hundred years,
then she could probably hold out for another hundred years or more."
kings-hares,3,"When he came to court they at once took him on as a herdsman. The place was not bad, there was good food, and good wages, and the chance of winning the princess besides. Yet if no more than a single one of the
king's hares were to be lost, they would cut three red strips from his
back, and throw him into the snake-pit.

As long as Peter was on the common or in the enclosure, he kept his
hares together nicely, but later, when they reached the forest, they ran
away from him across the hills. Peter ran after them with tremendous
leaps, as long as he thought he could catch even a single hare, but when
the very last one had vanished, his breath was gone, and he saw no more
of them. Toward noon he went home, taking his time about it, and when he
reached the enclosure, he looked around for them on all sides, but no
hares came. And then, when he came to the castle, there stood the king
with the knife in his hand. He cut three red strips from his back, and
cast him into the snake-pit."
kings-hares,4,"After a while Paul decided to go to the castle and herd the king's
hares. His father told him what he had told Peter, and more besides. But
he insisted on going, and would not listen, and he fared neither better
nor worse than Peter had. The old woman stood and pulled and jerked at
her nose in the tree-trunk, and he laughed, found it very amusing, and
let her stand there and torment herself. He was at once taken into
service, but the hares all ran away across the hills, though he pursued
them, and worked away like a shepherd dog in the sun, and when he came
back to the castle in the evening minus his hares, there stood the king
with the knife in his hand, cut three broad strips from his back, rubbed
in pepper and salt, and flung him into the snake-pit."
kings-hares,5,"Then, after some time had passed, the youngest decided to set out to
herd the king's hares, and told his father of his intention. He thought
that would be just the work for him, to loaf about in forest and field,
look for strawberry patches, herd a flock of hares, and lie down and
sleep in the sun between times. His father thought that there was other
work that would suit him better, and that even if he fared no worse than
his brothers, it was quite certain that he would fare no better. Whoever
herded the king's hares must not drag along as though he had lead in
his soles, or like a fly on a limerod. And that when the hares took to
their heels, it was a horse of another color from catching flees with
gloved hands. Whoever wanted to escape with a whole back, would have to
be more than quick and nimble, and swifter than a bird. But there was
nothing he could do. Esben merely kept on saying that he wanted to go to
court and serve the king, for he would not take service with any lesser
master, said he. And he would see to the hares, they could not be much
worse than a herd of goats or of calves. And with that he took his
knapsack and strolled comfortably down the hill."
kings-hares,6,"After he had wandered a while, and began to feel a proper hunger, he
came to the old woman who was wedged by the nose in the tree-trunk and
who was pulling and jerking away, in order to get loose.

""Good day, mother,"" said Esben, ""and why are you worrying yourself so
with your nose, you poor thing?"" ""No one has called me mother for the
last hundred years,"" said the old woman, ""but come and help me out, and
give me a bite to eat; for I have not had a bit to eat in all that time.
And I will do something for your sake as well,"" said she.

Yes, no doubt she would need something to eat and drink badly, said
Esben.

Then he hewed the tree-trunk apart, so that she got her nose out of the
cleft, sat down to eat, and shared with her. The old woman had a good
appetite, and she received a good half of his provisions."
kings-hares,7,"When they were through she gave Esben a whistle which had the power that if he blew into one end, whatever he wished scattered was scattered to all the winds, and when he blew into the other, all came together again. And if the whistle passed from his possession, it would return as soon as he wished it back.

""That is a wonderful whistle!"" thought Esben."
kings-hares,8,"When he came to the castle, they at once took him on as a shepherd. The
place was not bad, he was to have food and wages, and should he manage
to herd the king's hares without losing one of them, he might possibly
win the princess. But if he lost so much as a single hare, and no matter
how small it might be, then they would cut three red strips from his
back, and the king was so sure of his case that he went right off to
whet his knife. It would be a simple matter to herd the hares, thought
Esben. For when they went off they were as obedient as a herd of sheep,
and so long as they were on the common, and in the enclosure, they
even marched in rank and file. But when they reached the forest, and
noon-time came, and the sun burned down on hill and dale, they all took
to their heels and ran away across the hills."
kings-hares,9,"""Hallo, there! So you want to run away!"" called Esben, and blew into one
end of his whistle, and then they scattered the more quickly to all the
ends of the earth. But when he had reached an old charcoal-pit, he blew
into the other end of his whistle, and before he knew it the hares were
back again, and standing in rank and file so he could review them, just
like a regiment of soldiers on the drill-ground.

""That is a splendid whistle!"" thought Esben; lay down on a sunny
hillock, and fell asleep. The hares were left to their own devices, and
played until evening. Then he once more whistled them together, and took
them along to the castle like a herd of sheep."
kings-hares,10,"The king and queen and the princess, too, stood in the hall-way, and
wondered what sort of a fellow this was, who could herd hares without
losing a single one. The king reckoned and added them up, and counted
with his fingers, and then added them up again; but not even the
teeny-weeniest hare was missing. ""He is quite a chap, he is,"" said the
princess.

The following day he again went to the forest, and herded his hares. But
while he lay in all comfort beside a strawberry patch, they sent out the
chamber-maid from the castle to him, and she was to find out how he
managed to herd the king's hares."
kings-hares,11,"He showed her his whistle, and blew into one end, and all the hares
darted away across the hills in all directions, and then he blew into
the other, and they came trotting up from all sides, and once more stood
in rank and file. ""That is a wonderful whistle,"" said the chamber-maid.
She would gladly give him a hundred dollars, if he cared to sell it.

""Yes, it is a splendid whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I will not sell it for
money. But if you give me a hundred dollars, and a kiss with every
dollar to boot, then I might let you have it.""

Yes, indeed, that would suit her right down to the ground; she would
gladly give him two kisses with every dollar, and feel grateful,
besides."
kings-hares,12,"So she got the whistle, but when she reached the castle, the whistle
disappeared all of a sudden. Esben had wished it back again, and toward
evening he came along, driving his hares like a herd of sheep. The king
reckoned and counted and added, but all to no purpose, for not the least
little hare was missing.

When Esben was herding his hares the third day, they sent the princess
to him to get away his pipe from him. She was tickled to death, and
finally offered him two hundred dollars if he would let her have the
whistle, and would also tell her what she had to do in order to fetch it
safely home with her."
kings-hares,13,"""Yes, it is a very valuable whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I will not sell
it,"" but at last, as a favor to her, he said he would let her have it if
she gave him two hundred dollars, and a kiss for every dollar to boot.
But if she wanted to keep it, why, she must take good care of it, for
that was her affair.

""That is a very high price for a hare-whistle,"" said the princess, and
she really shrank from kissing him, ""but since we are here in the middle
of the forest, where no one can see or hear us, I'll let it pass, for I
positively must have the whistle,"" said she. And when Esben had pocketed
the price agreed upon, she received the whistle, and held it tightly
clutched in her hand all the way home; yet when she reached the castle,
and wanted to show it, it disappeared out of her hands. On the following
day the queen herself set out, and she felt quite sure that she would
succeed in coaxing the whistle away from him."
kings-hares,14,"She was stingier, and only offered fifty dollars; but she had to raise
her bid until she reached three hundred. Esben said it was a magnificent
whistle, and that the price was a beggarly one; but seeing that she
was the queen, he would let it pass. She was to pay him three hundred
dollars, and for every dollar she was to give him a buss to boot, then
she should have the whistle. And he was paid in full as agreed, since as
regards the busses the queen was not so stingy.

When she had the whistle in her hands, she tied it fast, and hid it
well, but she fared not a whit better than either of the others. When
she wanted to show the whistle it was gone, and in the evening Esben
came home, driving his hares as though they were a well-trained flock of
sheep."
kings-hares,15,"""You are stupid women!"" said the king. ""I suppose I will have to go to
him myself if we really are to obtain this trumpery whistle. There seems
to be nothing else left to do!"" And the following day, when Esben was
once more herding his hares, the king followed him, and found him at the
same place where the women had bargained with him.

They soon became good friends, and Esben showed him the whistle, and
blew into one end and the other, and the king thought the whistle very
pretty, and finally insisted on buying it, even though it cost him a
thousand dollars."
kings-hares,16,"""Yes, it is a magnificent whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I would not sell it
for money. But do you see that white mare over yonder?"" said he, and
pointed into the forest.

""Yes, she belongs to me, that is my Snow Witch!"" cried the king, for he
knew her very well.

""Well, if you will give me a thousand dollars, and kiss the white mare
that is grazing on the moor by the big pine, to boot, then you can have
my whistle!"" said Esben.

""Is that the only price at which you will sell?"" asked the king.

""Yes,"" said Esben.

""But at least may I not put a silken handkerchief between?"" asked the
king."
kings-hares,17,"This was conceded him, and thus he obtained the whistle. He put it in
the purse in his pocket, and carefully buttoned up the pocket. Yet when
he reached the castle, and wanted to take it out, he was in the same
case as the women, for he no longer had the whistle. And in the evening
Esben came home with his herd of hares, and not the least little hare
was missing.

The king was angry, and furious because he had made a fool of them all,
and had swindled the king's self out of the whistle into the bargain,
and now he wanted to do away with Esben. The queen was of the same
opinion, and said it was best to behead such a knave when he was caught
in the act."
kings-hares,18,"Esben thought this neither fair nor just; for he had only done what he
had been asked to do, and had defended himself as best he knew how.

But the king said that this made no difference to him; yet if Esben
could manage to fill the big brewing-cauldron till it ran over, he would
spare his life.

The job would be neither long nor hard, said Esben, he thought he could
warrant that, and he began to tell about the old woman with her nose
in the tree-trunk, and in between he said, ""I must make up plenty of
stories, to fill the cauldron,""--and then he told of the whistle, and
the chamber-maid who came to him and wanted to buy the whistle for a
hundred dollars, and about all the kisses that she had had to give him
to boot, up on the hillock by the forest; and then he told about the
princess, how she had come and kissed him so sweetly for the whistle's
sake, because no one could see or hear it in the forest--""I must make up
plenty of stories, in order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben. Then he
told of the queen, and of how stingy she had been with her money, and
how liberal with her busses--""for I must make up plenty of stories in
order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben."
kings-hares,19,"""But I think it must be full now!"" said the queen.

""O, not a sign of it!"" said the king.

Then Esben began to tell how the king had come to him, and about the
white mare who was grazing on the moor, ""and since he insisted on having
the whistle he had to--he had to--well, with all due respect, I have to
make up plenty of stories in order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben.

""Stop, stop! It is full, fellow!"" cried the king. ""Can't you see that it
is running over?""

The king and the queen were of the opinion that it would be best for
Esben to receive the princess and half the kingdom; there did not seem
anything else to do.

""Yes, it was a magnificent whistle!"" said Esben."
laotsze,1,"Laotsze is really older than heaven and earth put together. He is the Yellow Lord or Ancient, who created this world together with the other four. At various times he has appeared on earth, under various names. His most celebrated incarnation, however, is that of Laotsze, ""The Old Child,"" which name he was given because he made his appearance on earth with white hair."
laotsze,2,"He acquired all sorts of magic powers by means of which he extended his life-span. Once he hired a servant to do his bidding. He agreed to give him a hundred pieces of copper daily; yet he did not pay him, and finally he owed him seven million, two hundred thousand pieces of copper. Then he mounted a black steer and rode to the West. He wanted to take his servant along. But when they reached the Han-Gu pass, the servant refused to go further, and insisted on being paid. Yet Laotsze gave him nothing."
laotsze,3,"When they came to the house of the guardian of the pass, red clouds appeared in the sky. The guardian understood this sign and knew that a holy man was drawing near. So he went out to meet him and took him into his house. He questioned him with regard to hidden knowledge, but Laotsze only stuck out his tongue at him and would not say a word. Nevertheless, the guardian of the pass treated him with the greatest respect in his home. Laotsze's servant told the servant of the guardian that his master owed him a great deal of money, and begged the latter to put in a good word for him."
laotsze,4,"When the guardian's servant heard how large a sum it was, he was tempted to win so wealthy a man for a son-in-law, and he married him to his daughter. Finally the guardian heard of the matter and came to Laotsze together with the servant. Then Laotsze said to his servant: ""You rascally servant. You really should have been dead long ago. I hired you, and since I was poor and could give you no money, I gave you a life-giving talisman to eat. That is how you still happen to be alive. I said to you: 'If you will follow me into the West, the land of Blessed Repose, I will pay you your wages in yellow gold. But you did not wish to do this.'"" And with that he patted his servant's neck. There upon the latter opened his mouth, and spat out the life-giving talisman. The magic signs written on it with cinnabar, quite fresh and well-preserved, might still be seen. But the servant suddenly collapsed and turned into a heap of dry bones."
laotsze,5,"Then the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth and pleaded for him. He promised to pay the servant for Laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life. So Laotsze placed the talisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again. The guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him. Then he adored Laotsze as his master, and the latter taught him the art of eternal life, and left him his teachings, in five thousand words, which the guardian wrote down. The book which thus came into being is the Tao Teh King, ""The Book of the Way and Life."" Laotsze then disappeared from the eyes of men. The guardian of the pass however, followed his teachings, and was given a place among the immortals."
lasse-my-thrall,1,"Once upon a time there was a prince or a duke or whatever you choose
to call him, but at any rate a noble tremendously high-born, who did
not want to stay at home. And so he traveled about the world, and
wherever he went he was well received, and hobnobbed with the very
finest people; for he had an unheard of amount of money. He at once
found friends and acquaintances, no matter where he came; for whoever
has a full trough can always find pigs to thrust their snouts into it.
But since he handled his money as he did, it grew less and less, and
at last he was left high and dry, without a red cent. And there was an
end to all his many friends; for they did just as the pigs do. When he
had been well fleeced, they began to snivel and grunt, and soon
scattered, each about his own business. And there he stood, after
having been led about by the nose, abandoned by all. All had been glad
to help him get rid of his money; but none were willing to help him
regain it, so there was nothing left for him to do but to wander back
home again like a journeyman apprentice, and beg his way as he went."
lasse-my-thrall,2,"Late one evening he found himself in a big forest, without any idea as
to where he might spend the night. And as he was looking around, his
glance happened to fall on an old hut, peeping out from among the
bushes. Of course an old hut was no lodging for such a fine gentleman;
but when we cannot have what we want, we must take what we can get,
and since there was no help for it, he went into the hut. There was
not even a cat in it, not even a stool to sit on. But against one wall
there was a great chest. What might there be in the chest? Suppose
there were a few moldy crusts of bread in it? They would taste good to
him, for he had not been given a single thing all day long, and he was
so hungry that his inwards stuck to his ribs. He opened the chest. But
within the chest was another chest, and in that chest still another
chest, and so it went, one always smaller than the other, until they
were nothing but little boxes. And the more there were of them the
more trouble he took to open them; for whatever was hidden away so
carefully must be something exceptionally beautiful, thought he."
lasse-my-thrall,3,"At last he came to a tiny box, and in the tiny box was a slip of
paper--and that was all he had for his pains! At first he was much
depressed. But all at once, he saw that something was written on the
piece of paper, and on closer examination he was even able to spell
out the words, though they had a strange appearance. And he read:

""Lasse, my thrall!"""
lasse-my-thrall,4,"No sooner had he spoken these words than something answered, close to
his ear:

""What does my master command?""

He looked around, but saw no one. That's strange, thought he, and once
more read aloud:

""Lasse, my thrall!""

And just as before came the answer:

""What does my master command?""

""If there be some one about who hears what I say, he might be kind
enough to get me a little something to eat,"" said he; and at that very
moment a table, covered with all the good things to eat that one could
imagine, was standing in the hut. He at once began to eat and drink
and did well by himself. I have never had a better meal in my life,
thought he. And when his hunger was completely satisfied, he grew
sleepy and took up his scrap of paper again."
lasse-my-thrall,5,"""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""Now that you have brought me food and drink, you must also bring me a
bed in which to sleep. But it must be a very fine bed,"" said he; for
as you may well imagine, his ideas were more top-lofty now that he had
eaten well. His command was at once obeyed; and a bed so fine and
handsome stood in the hut, that a king might have been glad to have
found such sleeping accommodations. Now this was all very well and
good; but the good can always be bettered, and when he had lain down,
he decided that, after all, the hut was far too wretched for such a
fine bed. He took up the scrap of paper:

""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""If you can produce such a meal, and such a bed here in the wild wood,
you must surely be able to give me a better room; for you know I am
one of those who are used to sleeping in a castle, with golden mirrors
and rugs of gold brocade and luxuries and conveniences of every kind,""
said he. And no sooner had he spoken the words, than he was lying in
the most magnificent room he had ever seen."
lasse-my-thrall,6,"Now matters were arranged to suit him, and he was quite content as he
turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes.

But the room he had slept in was not the end of his magnificence. When
he woke the following morning and looked around, he saw that he had
been sleeping in a great castle. There was one room after another, and
wherever he went walls and ceilings were covered with ornaments and
decorations of every kind, all glittering so splendidly when the rays
of the sun fell on them that he had to put his hand to his eyes; for
wherever he looked everything sparkled with gold and silver. Then he
glanced out of the window and first began to realize how really
beautiful everything was. Gone were the fir-trees and juniper bushes,
and in their place showed the loveliest garden one might wish to see,
filled with beautiful trees and roses of every variety, in bush and
tree form. But there was not a human being in sight, not even a cat.
Yet he found it quite natural that everything should be so fine, and
that he should once more have become a great lord."
lasse-my-thrall,7,"He took up the scrap of paper:

""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""Now that you have provided me with food and a castle in which to
dwell, I am going to stay here, because it suits me,"" said he, ""but I
cannot live here all alone in this fashion. I must have serving-men
and serving-maids, at my command."" And so it was. Servants and lackeys
and maids and serving-women of every description arrived, and some of
them bowed and others courtseyed, and now the duke really began to
feel content."
lasse-my-thrall,8,"Now it happened that another great castle lay on the opposite side of
the forest, in which dwelt a king who owned the forest, and many broad
acres of field and meadow round about. And when the king came and
happened to look out of his window, he saw the new castle, on whose
roof the golden weathercocks were swinging to and fro, from time to
time, shining in his eyes.

""This is very strange,"" thought he, and sent for his courtiers. They
came without delay, bowing and scraping."
lasse-my-thrall,9,"""Do you see the castle yonder?"" said the king.

Their eyes grew as large as saucers and they looked.

Yes, indeed, they saw the castle.

""Who has dared to build such a castle on my ground?""

The courtiers bowed and scraped, but did not know. So the king sent
for his soldiers. They came tramping in and presented arms.

""Send out all my soldiers and horsemen,"" said the king, ""tear down the
castle instantly, hang whoever built it, and see to this at once."""
lasse-my-thrall,10,"The soldiers assembled in the greatest haste and set forth. The
drummers beat their drums and the trumpeters blew their trumpets, and
the other musicians practiced their art, each in his own way; so that
the duke heard them long before they came in sight. But this was not
the first time he had heard music of this sort, and he knew what it
meant, so once more he took up the scrap of paper:

""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""There are soldiers coming,"" said he, ""and now you must provide me
with soldiers and horsemen until I have twice as many as the folk on
the other side of the forest. And sabers and pistols and muskets and
cannon, and all that goes with them--but you must be quick about it!"""
lasse-my-thrall,11,"Quick it was, and when the duke looked out there was a countless host
of soldiers drawn up around the castle.

When the king's people arrived, they stopped and did not dare advance.
But the duke was by no means shy. He went at once to the king's
captain and asked him what he wanted."
lasse-my-thrall,12,"The captain repeated his instructions.

""They will not gain you anything,"" said the duke. ""You can see how
many soldiers I have, and if the king chooses to listen to me, we can
agree to become friends, I will aid him against all his enemies, and
what we undertake will succeed."" The captain was pleased with this
proposal, so the duke invited him to the castle, together with all his
officers, and his soldiers were given a swallow or two of something
wet and plenty to eat along with it. But while the duke and the
officers were eating and drinking, there was more or less talk, and
the duke learned that the king had a daughter, as yet unmarried and so
lovely that her like had never been seen. And the more they brought
the king's officers to eat, the stronger they inclined to the opinion
that the king's daughter would make a good wife for the duke. And as
they talked about it, the duke himself began to think it over. The
worst of it was, said the officers, that she was very haughty, and
never even deigned to look at a man. But the duke only laughed. ""If it
be no worse than that,"" he said, ""it is a trouble that may be cured."""
lasse-my-thrall,13,"When at last the soldiers had stowed away as much as they could hold,
they shouted hurrah until they woke the echoes in the hills, and
marched away. One may imagine what a fine parade march it was, for
some of them had grown a little loose-jointed in the knees. The duke
charged them to carry his greetings to the king, and say that he would
soon pay him a visit."
lasse-my-thrall,14,"When the duke was alone once more, he began to think of the princess
again, and whether she were really as beautiful as the soldiers had
said. He decided he would like to find out for himself. Since so many
strange things had happened that day, it was quite possible, thought
he."
lasse-my-thrall,15,"""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""Only that you bring the king's daughter here, as soon as she has
fallen asleep,"" said he. ""But mind that she does not wake up, either
on her way here, or on her way back."" And before long there lay the
princess on the bed. She was sleeping soundly, and looked charming as
she lay there asleep. One had to admit that she was as sweet as sugar.
The duke walked all around her; but she appeared just as beautiful
from one side as from the other, and the more the duke looked at her,
the better she pleased him.

""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""Now you must take the princess home again,"" said he, ""because now I
know what she looks like and to-morrow I shall sue for her hand."""
lasse-my-thrall,16,"The following morning the king stepped to the window. ""Now I shall not
have to see that castle across the way,"" he thought to himself. But
the evil one must have had a hand in the matter--there stood the
castle just as before, and the sun was shining brightly on its roof,
and the weather-vanes were sending beams into his eyes."
lasse-my-thrall,17,"The king once more fell into a rage, and shouted for all his people,
who hurried to him with more than usual rapidity. The courtiers bowed
and scraped and the soldiers marched in parade step and presented
arms.

""Do you see that castle there?"" roared the king.

They stretched their necks, their eyes grew large as saucers and they
looked."
lasse-my-thrall,18,"Yes, indeed, they saw it.

""Did I not order you to tear down that castle and hang its builder?""
he said.

This they could not deny; but now the captain himself stepped forward
and told what had occurred, and what an alarming number of soldiers
the duke had, and how magnificent his castle was.

Then he also repeated what the duke had said, and that he had sent his
greetings to the king."
lasse-my-thrall,19,"All this made the king somewhat dizzy, and he had to set his crown on
the table and scratch his head. It was beyond his comprehension--for
all that he was a king; since he could have sworn that it had all come
to pass in the course of a single night, and if the duke were not the
devil himself, he was at least a magician.

And as he sat there and thought, the princess came in."
lasse-my-thrall,20,"""God greet you, father,"" she said, ""I had a most strange and lovely
dream last night.""

""And what did you dream, my girl?"" said the king.

""O, I dreamt that I was in the new castle over yonder, and there was a
duke, handsome and so splendid beyond anything I could have imagined,
and now I want a husband.""

""What, you want a husband, and you have never even deigned to look at
a man; that is very strange!"" said the king.

""Be that as it may,"" said the princess, ""but that is how I feel now;
and I want a husband, and the duke is the husband I want,"" she
concluded."
lasse-my-thrall,21,"The king simply could not get over the astonishment the duke had
caused him.

Suddenly he heard an extraordinary beating of drums, and sounding of
trumpets and other instruments of every kind. And a message came that
the duke had arrived with a great retinue, all so magnificently
attired that every seam of their dresses was sparkling with gold and
silver. The king, in his crown and finest robe of state, stood looking
down the stairway, and the princess was all the more in favor of
carrying out her idea as quickly as possible."
lasse-my-thrall,22,"The duke greeted the king pleasantly, and the king returned his
greeting in the same way, and discussing their affairs together they
became good friends. There was a great banquet, and the duke sat
beside the princess at the table. What they said to each other I do
not know, but the duke knew so well how to talk that, no matter what
he said, the princess could not say no, and so he went to the king and
begged for her hand. The king could not exactly refuse it, for the
duke was the kind of a man whom it was better to have for a friend
than for an enemy; but he could not give his answer out of hand,
either. First he wished to see the duke's castle, and know how matters
stood with regard to this, that and the other--which was natural."
lasse-my-thrall,23,"So it was agreed that they should pay the duke a visit and bring the
princess with them, in order that she might examine his possessions,
and with that they parted.

When the duke reached home, Lasse had a lively time of it, for he was
given any number of commissions. But he rushed about, carrying them
out, and everything was arranged so satisfactorily that when the king
arrived with his daughter, a thousand pens could not have described
it. They went through all the rooms and looked around, and everything
was as it should be, and even better thought the king, who was very
happy. Then the wedding was celebrated and when it was over, and the
duke returned home with his young wife, he, too, gave a splendid
banquet, and that is how it went."
lasse-my-thrall,24,"After some time had passed, the duke one evening heard the words:

""Is my master content now?"" It was Lasse, though the duke could not
see him.

""I am well content,"" answered the duke, ""for you have brought me all
that I have.""

""But what did I get for it?"" said Lasse.

""Nothing,"" replied the duke, ""but, heaven above, what was I to give
you, who are not flesh and blood, and whom I cannot even see,"" said
he. ""Yet if there be anything I can do for you, why let me know what
it is, and I will do it.""

""I would very much like to have the little scrap of paper that you
keep in the box,"" said Lasse."
lasse-my-thrall,25,"""If that is all you want, and if such a trifle is of any service to
you, your wish shall be granted, for I believe I know the words by
heart now,"" said the duke.

Lasse thanked him, and said all the duke need do, would be to lay the
paper on the chair beside his bed, when he went to sleep, and that he
would fetch it during the night.

This the duke did, and then he went to bed and fell asleep."
lasse-my-thrall,26,"But toward morning the duke woke up, freezing so that his teeth
chattered, and when he had fully opened his eyes, he saw that he had
been stripped of everything, and had scarcely a shirt to his name. And
instead of lying in the handsome bed in the handsome bed-room in the
magnificent castle, he lay on the big chest in the old hut. He at once
called out:

""Lasse, my thrall!"" But there was no answer.

Then he cried again:

""Lasse, my thrall!"" Again there was no answer. So he called out as
loudly as he could:

""Lasse, my thrall!"" But this third call was also in vain."
lasse-my-thrall,27,"Now he began to realize what had happened, and that Lasse, when he
obtained the scrap of paper, no longer had to serve him, and that he
himself had made this possible. But now things were as they were, and
there stood the duke in the old hut, with scarcely a shirt to his
name. The princess herself was not much better off, though she had
kept her clothes; for they had been given her by her father, and Lasse
had no power over them."
lasse-my-thrall,28,"Now the duke had to explain everything to the princess, and beg her to
leave him, since it would be best if he tried to get along as well as
he could himself, said he. But this the princess would not do. She had
a better memory for what the pastor had said when he married them, she
told him, and that she was never, never to leave him."
lasse-my-thrall,29,"At length the king awoke in his castle, and when he looked out of the
window, he saw not a single stone of the other castle in which his
son-in-law and his daughter lived. He grew uneasy and sent for his
courtiers.

They came in, bowing and scraping."
lasse-my-thrall,30,"""Do you see the castle there, on the other side of the forest?"" he
asked. They stretched their necks and opened their eyes. But they
could see nothing.

""What has become of it?"" said the king. But this question they were
unable to answer."
lasse-my-thrall,31,"In a short time the king and his entire court set out, passed through
the forest, and when they came to the place where the castle, with its
great gardens, should have been standing, they saw nothing but
juniper-bushes and scrub-pines. And then they happened to see the
little hut amid the brush. He went in and--O the poor king!--what did
he see?"
lasse-my-thrall,32,"There stood his son-in-law, with scarcely a shirt to his name, and his
daughter, and she had none too much to wear, and was crying and
sniveling at a fearful rate. ""For heaven's sake, what is the trouble
here?"" said the king. But he received no answer; for the duke would
rather have died than have told him the whole story."
lasse-my-thrall,33,"The king urged and pressed him, first amiably, then in anger; but the
duke remained obstinate and would have nothing to say. Then the king
fell into a rage, which is not very surprising, for now he realized
that this fine duke was not what he purported to be, and he therefore
ordered him to be hung, and hung on the spot. It is true that the
princess pleaded earnestly for him, but tears and prayers were useless
now, for he was a rascal and should die a rascal's death--thus spake
the king."
lasse-my-thrall,34,"And so it was. The king's people set up a gallows and put a rope
around the duke's neck. But as they were leading him to the gallows,
the princess got hold of the hangman and gave him a gratuity, for
which they were to arrange matters in such wise that the duke need not
die. And toward evening they were to cut him down, and he and the
princess would disappear. So the bargain was made. In the meantime
they strung him up and then the king, together with his court and all
the people, went away."
lasse-my-thrall,35,"Now the duke was at the end of his rope. Yet he had time enough to
reflect about his mistake in not contenting himself with an inch
instead of reaching out at once for an ell; and that he had so
foolishly given back the scrap of paper to Lasse annoyed him most of
all. If I only had it again, I would show every one that adversity has
made me wise, he thought to himself. But when the horse is stolen we
close the stable door. And that is the way of the world."
lasse-my-thrall,36,"And then he dangled his legs, since for the time being there was
nothing else for him to do.

It had been a long, hard day for him, and he was not sorry when he saw
the sun sinking behind the forest. But just as the sun was setting he
suddenly heard a most tremendous Yo ho! and when he looked down there
were seven carts of worn-out shoes coming along the road, and a-top
the last cart was a little old man in gray, with a night-cap on his
head. He had the face of some horrible specter, and was not much
better to look at in other respects."
lasse-my-thrall,37,"He drove straight up to the gallows, and stopped when he was directly
beneath them, looked up at the duke and laughed--the horrible old
creature!
""And is this the measure of your stupidity?"" he said, ""but then what
is a fellow of your sort to do with his stupidity, if he does not put
it to some use?""--and then he laughed again. ""Yes, there you hang, and
here I am carting off all the shoes I wore out going about on your
silly errands. I wonder, sometimes, whether you can actually read what
is written on that scrap of paper, and whether you recognize it,"" said
he, laughing again, indulging in all sorts of horse-play, and waving
the scrap of paper under the duke's nose."
lasse-my-thrall,38,"But all who are hanging on the gallows are not dead, and this time
Lasse was the greater fool of the two.

The duke snatched--and tore the scrap of paper from his hand!

""Lasse, my thrall!""

""What does my master command?""

""Cut me down from the gallows at once, and restore the castle and
everything else just as it was before, then when it is dark, bring the
princess back to it.""

Everything was attended to with alarming rapidity, and soon all was
exactly as it had been before Lasse had decamped."
lasse-my-thrall,39,"When the king awoke the following morning, he looked out of the window
as usual, and there the castle was standing as before, with its
weathercocks gleaming handsomely in the sunlight. He sent for his
courtiers, and they came in bowing and scraping.

""Do you see the castle over yonder?"" asked the king.

They stretched their necks, and gazed and stared. Yes, indeed, they
could see the castle.

Then the king sent for the princess; but she was not there. Thereupon
the king set off to see whether his son-in-law was hanging in the
appointed spot; but no, there was not a sign of either son-in-law or
gallows.

Then he had to take off his crown and scratch his head. Yet that did
not change matters, and he could not for the life of him understand
why things should be as they were. Finally he set out with his entire
court, and when they reached the spot where the castle should have
been standing, there it stood."
lasse-my-thrall,40,"The gardens and the roses were just as they had been, and the duke's
servitors were to be seen in swarms beneath the trees. His son-in-law
in person, together with his daughter, dressed in the finest clothes,
came down the stairs to meet him."
lasse-my-thrall,41,"The devil has a hand in it, thought the king; and so strange did all
seem to him that he did not trust the evidence of his own eyes.

""God greet you and welcome, father!"" said the duke. The king could
only stare at him. ""Are you, are you my son-in-law?"" he asked.

""Why, of course,"" said the duke, ""who else am I supposed to be?""

""Did I not have you strung up yesterday as a thief and a vagabond?""
inquired the king.

""I really believe father has gone out of his mind on the way over to
us,"" said the duke and laughed.

""Does father think that I would allow myself to be hanged so easily?
Or is there any one present who dare suppose such a thing?"" he said,
and looked them straight in the eye, so that they knew he was looking
at them. They bent their backs and bowed and scraped.

""And who can imagine any such thing? How could it be possible? Or
should there be any one present who dare say that the king wishes me
ill, let him speak out,"" said the duke, and gazed at them with even
greater keenness than before. All bent their backs and bowed and
scraped."
lasse-my-thrall,42,"How should any of them come to any such conclusion? No, none of them
were foolish to such a degree, they said.

Now the king was really at a loss to know what to think. When he
looked at the duke he felt sure that he could never have wished to
harm him, and yet--he was not quite sure.

""Was I not here yesterday, and was not the whole castle gone, and had
not an old hut taken its place, and did I not enter the hut and see
you standing there with scarcely a shirt to your name?"" he asked."
lasse-my-thrall,43,"""How father talks,"" said the duke. ""I am afraid, very much afraid,
that trolls have blinded you, and led you astray in the forest. What
do you think?"" he said and turned to the courtiers.

They at once bowed and cringed fifty times in succession, and took the
duke's side, as stands to reason.

The king rubbed his eyes and looked around."
lasse-my-thrall,44,"""It must be as you say,"" he told the duke, ""and I believe that I have
recovered my reason, and have found my eyes again. And it would have
been a sin and shame had I had you hung,"" said he. Then he grew joyful
and no one gave the matter further thought."
lasse-my-thrall,45,"But adversity teaches one to be wise, so people say, and the duke now
began to attend to most things himself, and to see to it that Lasse
did not have to wear out so many pairs of shoes. The king at once
bestowed half the kingdom upon him, which gave him plenty to do, and
people said that one would have to look far in order to find a better
ruler."
lasse-my-thrall,46,"Then Lasse came to the duke one day, and though he did not look much
better than before, he was more civil and did not venture to grin and
carry on.

""You no longer need my help,"" said he, ""for though formerly I used to
wear out all my shoes, I now cannot even wear out a single pair, and I
almost believe my legs are moss-grown. Will you not discharge me?"""
lasse-my-thrall,47,"The duke thought he could. ""I have taken great pains to spare you, and
I really believe that I can get along without you,"" he replied. ""But
the castle here and all the other things I could not well dispense
with, since I never again could find an architect like yourself, and
you may take for granted that I have no wish to ornament the
gallows-tree a second time. Therefore I will not, of my own free will,
give you back the scrap of paper,"" said he."
lasse-my-thrall,48,"""While it is in your possession I have nothing to fear,"" answered
Lasse.

""But should the paper fall into other hands, then I should have to
begin to run and work all over again and that, just that, is what I
would like to prevent. When a fellow has been working a thousand
years, as I have, he is bound to grow weary at last."""
lasse-my-thrall,49,"So they came to the conclusion that the duke should put the scrap of
paper in its little box and bury it seven ells underground, beneath a
stone that had grown there and would remain there as well. Then they
thanked each other for pleasant comradeship and separated. The duke
did as he had agreed to do, and no one saw him hide the box. He lived
happily with his princess, and was blessed with sons and daughters.
When the king died, he inherited the whole kingdom and, as you may
imagine, he was none the worse off thereby, and no doubt he is still
living and ruling there, unless he has died.

As to the little box containing the scrap of paper, many are still
digging and searching for it."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,1,"Leelinau was the favorite daughter of a hunter, who lived on the lake
shore near the base of the lofty highlands, called Kaug Wudjoo.

From her earliest youth she was observed to be thoughtful and retiring.
She passed much of her time in solitude, and seemed ever to prefer the
companionship of her own shadow to the society of the lodge-circle.

Whenever she could leave her father's lodge she would fly to remote
haunts and recesses in the woods, or sit in lonely reverie upon some
high promontory of rock overlooking the lake. In such places she would
often, with her face turned upward, linger long in contemplation of the
air, as if she were invoking her guardian spirit, and beseeching him to
lighten her sadness."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,2,"But amid all the leafy haunts, none drew her steps toward it so often as
a forest of pines, on the open shore, called Manitowok, or the Sacred
Wood. It was one of those hallowed places which is the resort of the
little wild men of the woods, and of the turtle spirits or fairies which
delight in romantic scenes. Owing to this circumstance, its green
retirement was seldom visited by Indians, who feared to fall under the
influence of its mischievous inhabitants.

And whenever they were compelled by stress of weather to make a landing
on this part of the coast, they never failed to leave an offering of
tobacco, or some other token, to show that they desired to stand well
with the proprietors of the fairy ground."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,3,"To this sacred spot Leelinau had made her way at an early age, gathering
strange flowers and plants, which she would bring home to her parents,
and relate to them all the haps and mishaps that had occurred in her
rambles.

Although they discountenanced her frequent visits to the place, they
were not able to restrain them, for she was of so gentle and delicate a
temper that they feared to thwart her.

Her attachment to the fairy wood, therefore, grew with her years. If she
wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams, or any other
maiden favor, Leelinau repaired to the Manitowok. If her father remained
abroad in the hunt later than usual, and it was feared that he had been
overwhelmed by the tempest, or had met with some other mischance,
Leelinau offered up her prayers for safety at the Manitowok. It was
there that she fasted, mused, and strolled."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,4,"She at length became so engrossed by the fairy pines that her parents
began to suspect that some evil spirit had enticed her to its haunts,
and had cast upon her a charm which she had not the power to resist.

This belief was confirmed when, one day, her mother, who had secretly
followed her, overheard her murmuring to some unknown and invisible
companion, appeals like these:

""Spirit of the dancing leaves!"" whispered Leelinau, ""hear a throbbing
heart in its sadness. Spirit of the foaming stream! visit thou my
nightly pillow, shedding over it silver dreams of mountain brook and
pebbly rivulet. Spirit of the starry night! lead my foot-prints to the
blushing mis-kodeed, or where the burning passion-flower shines with
carmine hue. Spirit of the greenwood plume!"" she concluded, turning with
passionate gaze to the beautiful young pines which stood waving their
green beauty over her head, ""shed on me, on Leelinau the sad, thy leafy
fragrance, such as spring unfolds from sweetest flowers, or hearts that
to each other show their inmost grief. Spirits! hear, O hear a maiden's
prayer!"""
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,5,"Day by day, these strange communings with unseen beings drew away the
heart of Leelinau more and more from the simple duties of the lodge,
and she walked among her people, melancholy and silent, like a spirit
who had visited them from another land.

The pastimes which engaged the frolic moments of her young companions,
passed by her as little trivial pageants in which she had no concern.

When the girls of the neighboring lodges assembled to play at the
favorite female game of pappus-e-ko-waun, or the block and string,
before the lodge-door, Leelinau would sit vacantly by, or enter so
feebly into the spirit of the play as to show that it was irksome to
her."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,6,"Again, in the evening, when the young people formed a ring around the
lodge, and the piepeend-jigun, or leather and bone, passed rapidly from
one to the other, she either handed it along without attempting to play,
or if she took a part, it was with no effort to succeed.

The time of the corn-gathering had come, and the young people of the
tribe were assembled in the field, busy in plucking the ripened maize.
One of the girls, noted for her beauty, had found a red ear, and every
one congratulated her that a brave admirer was on his way to her
father's lodge. She blushed, and hiding the trophy in her bosom, she
thanked the Good Spirit that it was a red ear, and not a crooked, that
she had found."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,7,"Presently it chanced that one who was there among the young men, espied
in the hands of Leelinau, who had plucked it indifferently, one of the
crooked kind, and at once the word ""Wa-ge-min!"" was shouted aloud
through the field, and the whole circle was set in a roar.

""The thief is in the corn-field!"" exclaimed the young man, Iagoo by
name, and famous in the tribe for his mirthful powers of story-telling;
""see you not the old man stooping as he enters the field? See you not
signs that he crouched as he crept in the dark? Is it not plain by this
mark on the stalk that he was heavily bent in his back? Old man! be
nimble, or some one will take thee while thou art taking the ear.""

These questions Iagoo accompanied with the action of one bowed with age
stealthily entering the corn-field. He went on:"
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,8,"""See how he stoops as he breaks off the ear. Nushka! He seems for a
moment to tremble. Walker, be nimble! Hooh! It is plain the old man is
the thief.""

He turned suddenly where she sat in the circle, pensively regarding the
crooked ear which she held in her hand, and exclaimed:

""Leelinau, the old man is thine!""

Laughter rung merrily through the corn-field, but Leelinau, casting down
upon the ground the crooked ear of maize, walked pensively away.

The next morning the eldest son of a neighboring chief called at her
father's lodge. He was quite advanced in years; but he enjoyed such
renown in battle, and his name was so famous in the hunt, that the
parents accepted him as a suitor for their daughter."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,9,"They hoped that his
shining qualities would draw back the thoughts of Leelinau from that
spirit-land whither she seemed to have wholly directed her affections.

It was this chief's son whom Iagoo had pictured as the corn-taker, but,
without objecting to his age, or giving any other reason, Leelinau
firmly declined his proposals. The parents ascribed the young daughter's
hesitancy to maiden fear, and paying no further heed to her refusal, a
day was fixed for the marriage-visit to the lodge.

The young warrior came to the lodge-door, and Leelinau refused to see
him; informing her parents, at the same time, that she would never
consent to the match."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,10,"It had been her custom to pass many of her hours in her favorite place
of retirement, under a broad-topped young pine, whose leaves whispered
in every wind that blew; but most of all in that gentle murmur of the
air at the evening hour, dear to lovers, when the twilight steals on.

Thither she now repaired, and, while reclining pensively against the
young pine-tree, she fancied that she heard a voice addressing her. At
first it was scarcely more than a sigh; presently it grew more clear,
and she heard it distinctly whisper--

""Maiden! think me not a tree; but thine own dear lover; fond to be with
thee in my tall and blooming strength, with the bright green nodding
plume that waves above thee. Thou art leaning on my breast, Leelinau;
lean forever there and be at peace. Fly from men who are false and
cruel, and quit the tumult of their dusty strife, for this quiet, lonely
shade."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,11,"Over thee I my arms will fling, fairer than the lodge's roof. I
will breathe a perfume like that of flowers over thy happy evening rest.
In my bark canoe I'll waft thee o'er the waters of the sky-blue lake. I
will deck the folds of thy mantle with the sun's last rays. Come, and on
the mountain free rove a fairy bright with me!""

Leelinau drunk in with eager ear these magical words. Her heart was
fixed. No warrior's son should clasp her hand. She listened in the hope
to hear the airy voice speak more; but it only repeated, ""Again! again!""
and entirely ceased."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,12,"On the eve of the day fixed for her marriage, Leelinau decked herself in
her best garments. She arranged her hair according to the fashion of her
tribe, and put on all of her maiden ornaments in beautiful array. With a
smile, she presented herself before her parents.

""I am going,"" she said, ""to meet my little lover, the chieftain of the
Green Plume, who is waiting for me at the Spirit Grove.""

Her face was radiant with joy, and the parents, taking what she had said
as her own fanciful way of expressing acquiescence in their plans,
wished her good fortune in the happy meeting."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,13,"""I am going,"" she continued, addressing her mother as they left the
lodge, ""I am going from one who has watched my infancy and guarded my
youth; who has given me medicine when I was sick, and prepared my food
when I was well. I am going from a father who has ranged the forest to
procure the choicest skins for my dress, and kept his lodge supplied
with the best spoil of the chase. I am going from a lodge which has been
my shelter from the storms of winter, and my shield from the heats of
summer. Farewell, my parents, farewell!""

So saying, she sped faster than any could follow her to the margin of
the fairy wood, and in a moment was lost to sight.

As she had often thus withdrawn herself from the lodge, the parents were
not in fear, but confidently awaited her return. Hour chased hour, as
the clouds of evening rolled up in the west; darkness came on, but no
daughter returned."
leelinau-the-lost-daughter,14,"With torches they hastened to the wood, and although
they lit up every dark recess and leafy gloom, their search was in vain.
Leelinau was nowhere to be seen. They called aloud, in lament, upon her
name, but she answered not.

Suns rose and set, but nevermore in their light did the bereaved parents
eyes behold the lost form of their beloved child. Their daughter was
lost indeed. Whither she had vanished no mortal tongue could tell;
although it chanced that a company of fishermen, who were spearing fish
near the Spirit Grove, descried something that seemed to resemble a
female figure standing on the shore. As the evening was mild and the
waters calm, they cautiously pulled their canoe toward land, but the
slight ripple of their oars excited alarm. The figure fled in haste, but
they could recognize in the shape and dress as she ascended the bank,
the lost daughter, and they saw the green plumes of her fairy-lover
waving over his forehead as he glided lightly through the forest of
young pines."
little-lasse,1,"There was once a little boy whose name was Lars, and because he was so
little he was called Little Lasse; he was a brave little man, for he
sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat.

It was summer time, when the pea shells grew long and green in the
garden. Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose
high above his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest
and straightest he could find.

Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; but that was
foolish, for God sees everywhere.

Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard
something rustling in the pea bed.

'I think that must be a sparrow,' he said. 'Ras! Ras!' but no sparrows
flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs. 'Wait! I
will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,' said the gardener.

Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path.

'Forgive me, dear gardener!' he said. 'I wanted to get some fine boats.'

'Well, I will this time,' said the gardener. 'But another time Little
Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed.'"
little-lasse,2,"'I will,' answered Lasse; and he went off to the shore. Then he opened
the shells with a pin, split them carefully in two, and broke small
little bits of sticks for the rowers' seats. Then he took the peas which
were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. Some of the
shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse
had twelve boats. But they should not be boats, they should be large
warships. He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three
schooners. The largest liner was called Hercules, and the smallest
schooner The Flea. Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and
they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the
waves of the ocean.

And now the ships must sail round the world. The great island over there
was Asia; that large stone Africa; the little island America; the small
stones were Polynesia; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was
Europe. The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of
the world. The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the
frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to
Polynesia. But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones
out into the great sea.

Now, there was on the shore of Europe a real boat, father's own, a
beautiful white-painted boat, and Little Lasse got into it. Father and
mother had forbidden this, but Little Lasse forgot. He thought he should
very much like to travel to some other part of the world."
little-lasse,3,"'I shall row out a little way--only a very little way,' he thought. The
pea-shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little
specks on the ocean. 'I shall seize Hercules on the coast of Asia,' said
Lasse, 'and then row home again to Europe.'

He shook the rope that held the boat, and, strange to say, the rope
became loose. Ditsch, ratsch, a man is a man, and so Little Lasse manned
the boat.

Now he would row--and he could row, for he had rowed so often on the
step sat home, when the steps pretended to be a boat and father's big
stick an oar. But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars
to be found in the boat. The oars were locked up in the boat-house, and
Little Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty. It is not so easy
as one thinks to row to Asia without oars.

What could Little Lasse do now? The boat was already some distance out
on the sea, and the wind, which blew from land, was driving it still
further out. Lasse was frightened and began to cry. But there was no
one on the shore to hear him. Only a big crow perched alone in the birch
tree; and the gardener's black cat sat under the birch tree, waiting to
catch the crow. Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about
Little Lasse, who was drifting out to sea."
little-lasse,4,"Ah! how sorry Little Lasse was now that he had been disobedient and got
into the boat, when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do
so! Now it was too late, he could not get back to land. Perhaps he would
be lost out on the great sea. What should he do?

When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him, he put
his two little hands together and said, 'Good God, do not be angry with
Little Lasse.' And then he went to sleep. For although it was daylight,
old Nukku Matti was sitting on the shores of the 'Land of Nod,' and was
fishing for little children with his long fishing rod. He heard the low
words which Little Lasse said to God, and he immediately drew the boat
to himself and laid Little Lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves.

Then Nukku Matti said to one of the Dreams, 'Play with Little Lasse, so
that he does not feel lonesome.'

It was a little dream-boy, so little, so little, that he was less than
Lasse himself; he had blue eyes and fair hair, a red cap with a silver
band, and white coat with pearls on the collar. He came to Little Lasse
and said, 'Would you like to sail round the world?'

'Yes,' said Lasse in his sleep, 'I should like to.'

'Come, then,' said the dream-boy, 'and let us sail in your pea-shell
boats. You shall sail in Hercules and I shall sail in The Flea.'"
little-lasse,5,"So they sailed away from the 'Land of Nod,' and in a little while
Hercules and The Flea were on the shores of Asia away at the other end
of the world, where the Ice Sea flows through Behring Straits into the
Pacific Ocean. A long way off in the winter mist they could see the
explorer Nordenskiold with his ship Vega trying to find an opening
between the ice. It was so cold, so cold; the great icebergs glittered
strangely, and the huge whales now lived under the ice, for they could
not make a hole through with their awkward heads. All around on the
dreary shore there was snow and snow as far as the eye could see; little
grey men in shaggy skins moved about, and drove in small sledges through
the snow drifts, but the sledges were drawn by dogs."
little-lasse,6,"'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy.

'No,' said Little Lasse. 'I am so afraid that the whales would swallow
us up, and the big dogs bite us. Let us sail instead to another part of
the world.'

'Very well,' said the dream-boy with the red cap and the silver band;
'it is not far to America'--and at the same moment they were there.

The sun was shining and it was very warm. Tall palm trees grew in long
rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches. Men red as
copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows
at the buffaloes, who turned against them with their sharp horns. An
enormous cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw
itself on to a little llama that was grazing at the foot. Knaps! it was
all over the little llama."
little-lasse,7,"'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy.

'No,' said Little Lasse. 'I am so afraid that the buffaloes will butt
us, and the great serpent eat us up. Let us travel to another part of
the world.'

'Very well,' said the dream-boy with the white coat, 'it is only a
little way to Polynesia'--and then they were there.

It was very warm there, as warm as in a hot bath in Finland. Costly
spices grew on the shores: the pepper plant, the cinnamon tree, ginger,
saffron; the coffee plant and the tea plant. Brown people with long ears
and thick lips, and hideously painted faces, hunted a yellow-spotted
tiger among the high bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned on them
and stuck its claws into one of the brown men. Then all the others took
to flight."
little-lasse,8,"'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy.

'No,' said Little Lasse. 'Don't you see the tiger away there by the
pepper plant? Let us travel to another part of the world.'

'We can do so,' said the dream-boy with the blue eyes. 'We are not far
from Africa'--and as he said that they were there.

They anchored at the mouth of a great river where the shores were
as green as the greenest velvet. A little distance from the river an
immense desert stretched away. The air was yellow; the sun shone so hot,
so hot as if it would burn the earth to ashes, and the people were as
black as the blackest jet. They rode across the desert on tall camels;
the lions roared with thirst, and the great crocodiles with their grey
lizard heads and sharp white teeth gaped up out of the river."
little-lasse,9,"'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy.

'No,' said Little Lasse. 'The sun would burn us, and the lions and the
crocodiles would eat us up. Let us travel to another part of the world.'

'We can travel back to Europe,' said the dream-boy with the fair hair.
And with that they were there.

They came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly.
There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; at the top sat
the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener's black cat. Not far
away was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; near the house
there was a garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells.
An old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the
cucumbers were ripe. Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw
Little Lasse he wagged his tail. Old Stina was milking the cows in the
farmyard, and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl
on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached.
There was, too, a well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a
long pipe in his mouth; he was going to see if the reapers had cut the
rye. A boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out, 'Little
Lasse! Come home for bread-and-butter!'

'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes
roguishly.

'Come with me, and I shall ask mother to give you some bread-and-butter
and a glass of milk,' said Little Lasse."
little-lasse,10,"'Wait a little,' said the dream-boy. And now Little Lasse saw that the
kitchen door was open, and from within there was heard a low, pleasant
frizzling, like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a
wooden ladle into a hot frying-pan.

'Perhaps we should sail back to Polynesia now?' said the happy
dream-boy.

'No; they are frying pancakes in Europe just now,' said Little Lasse;
and he wanted to jump ashore, but he could not. The dream-boy had tied
him with a chain of flowers, so that he could not move. And now all
the little dreams came about him, thousands and thousands of little
children, and they made a ring around him and sang a little song:

          The world is very, very wide,
               Little Lasse, Lasse,
          And though you've sailed beyond the tide,
          You can never tell how wide
          It is on the other side,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          You have found it cold and hot,
               Little Lasse, Lasse;
          But in no land is God not,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          Many men live there as here,
          But they all to God are dear,
               Little Lasse, Lasse.
          When His angel is your guide,
               Little Lasse, Lasse,
          Then no harm can e'er betide,
          Even on the other side
               Where the wild beasts wander.
          But tell us now,
               Whene'er you roam,
               Do you not find the best is home
          Of all the lands you've looked upon,
               Lasse, Little Lasse?"
little-lasse,11,"When the dreams had sung their song they skipped away, and Nukku Matti
carried Lasse back to the boat. He lay there for a long time quite
still, and he still heard the frying-pan frizzling at home of the fire,
the frizzling was very plain, Little Lasse heard it quite near him; and
so he woke up and rubbed his eyes.

There he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep. The wind had
turned, and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with
another while Little Lasse slept, and what Lasse thought was frizzling
in a frying-pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against
the stones on the shore. But he was not altogether wrong, for the clear
blue sea is like a great pan in which God's sun all day makes cakes for
good children.

Little Lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him.
Everything was the same as before; the crow in the birch tree, the cat
on the grass, and the pea-shell fleet on the shore. Some of the ships
had foundered, and some had drifted back to land. Hercules had come back
with its cargo from Asia, The Flea had arrived from Polynesia, and the
other parts of the world were just where they were before.

Little Lasse did not know what to think. He had so often been in that
grotto in the 'Land of Nod' and did not know what tricks dreams can
play. But Little Lasse did not trouble his head with such things; he
gathered together his boats and walked up the shore back to the house."
little-lasse,12,"His brother and sister ran to meet him, and called out from the
distance, 'Where have you been so long, Lasse? Come home and get some
bread-and-butter.' The kitchen door stood open, and inside was heard a
strange frizzling.

The gardener was near the gate, watering the dill and parsley, the
carrots and parsnips.

'Well,' he said, 'where has Little Lasse been so long?'

Little Lasse straightened himself up stiff, and answered: 'I have sailed
round the world in a pea-shell boat.'

'Oh!' said the gardener.

He has forgotten Dreamland. But you have not forgotten it; you know that
it exists. You know the beautiful grotto and the bright silver walls
whose lustre never fades, the sparkling diamonds which never grow dim,
the music which never ceases its low, soft murmur through the sweet
evening twilight. The airy fairy fancies of happy Dreamland never grow
old; they, like the glorious stars above us, are always young. Perhaps
you have caught a glimpse of their ethereal wings as they flew around
your pillow. Perhaps you have met the same dream-boy with the blue eyes
and the fair hair, the one who wore the red cap with the silver band and
the white coat with pearls on the collar. Perhaps he has taken you to
see all the countries of the world and the peoples, the cold waste lands
and the burning deserts, the many coloured men and the wild creatures
in the sea and in the woods, so that you may earn many things, but come
gladly home again. Yes, who knows? Perhaps you also have sailed round
the wide world once in a pea-shell boat."
little-miss-muffet,1,"Little Miss Muffet's father was a big banker in a big city, and he had so much money that the house he lived in was almost as beautiful as a king's palace. It was built of granite and marble, and richly furnished with every luxury that money can buy. There was an army of servants about the house, and many of them had no other duties than to wait upon Miss Muffet, for the little girl was an only child and therefore a personage of great importance. She had a maid to dress her hair and a maid to bathe her, a maid to serve her at table and a maid to tie her shoestrings, and several maids beside. And then there was Nurse Holloweg to look after all the maids and see they did their tasks properly."
little-miss-muffet,2,"The child's father spent his days at his office and his evenings at his club; her mother was a leader in society, and therefore fully engaged from morning till night and from night till morn; so that Little Miss Muffet seldom saw her parents and scarce knew them when she did see them."
little-miss-muffet,3,"I have never known by what name she was christened. Perhaps she did not know herself, for everyone had called her ""Miss Muffet"" since she could remember. The servants spoke of her respectfully as Miss Muffet. Mrs. Muffet would say, at times, ""By the way, Nurse, how is Miss Muffet getting along?"" And Mr. Muffet, when he met his little daughter by chance on the walk or in the hallway, would stop and look at her gravely and say, ""So this is Miss Muffet. Well, how are you feeling, little one?"" And then, without heeding her answer, he would walk away."
little-miss-muffet,4,"Perhaps you think that Miss Muffet, surrounded by every luxury and with a dozen servants to wait upon her, was happy and contented; but such was not the case. She wanted to run and romp, but they told her it was unladylike; she wished to play with other children, but none were rich enough to be proper associates for her; she longed to dig in the dirt in the garden, but Nurse Holloweg was shocked at the very thought. So Miss Muffet became sullen and irritable, and scolded everyone about her, and lived a very unhappy life. And her food was too rich and gave her dyspepsia, so that she grew thin and pale and did not sleep well at night."
little-miss-muffet,5,"One afternoon her mother, who happened to be at home for an hour, suddenly thought of her little daughter; so she rang the bell and asked for Nurse Holloweg.

""How is Miss Muffet, Nurse?"" enquired the lady.

""Very badly, ma'am,"" was the reply.

""Badly! What do you mean? Is she ill?""

""She's far from well, ma'am,"" answered the Nurse, ""and seems to be getting worse every day.""

""Well,"" replied the lady; ""you must have the doctor to see her; and don't forget to let me know what he says. That is all, Nurse.""

She turned to her novel again, and the Nurse walked away and sent a servant for the doctor. That great man, when he came, shook his head solemnly and said,

""She must have a change. Take her away into the country as soon as possible.""

""And very good advice it was, too,"" remarked the Nurse to one of the maids; ""for I feel as if I needed a change myself.""

When she reported the matter to Mrs. Muffet the mother answered,

""Very well; I will see Mr. Muffet and have him write out a cheque."""
little-miss-muffet,6,"And so it was that a week later Little Miss Muffet went to the country, or rather to a small town where there was a summer hotel that had been highly recommended to Nurse Holloweg; and with her went the string of maids and a wagon-load of boxes and trunks.


The morning after their arrival the little girl asked to go out upon the lawn.

""Well,"" replied Nurse Holloweg, ""Sarah can take you out for half an hour. But remember you are not to run and get heated, for that will ruin your complexion; and you must not speak to any of the common children you meet, for your mother would object; and you must not get your shoes dusty nor your dress soiled, nor disobey Sarah in any way."""
little-miss-muffet,7,"Little Miss Muffet went out in a very angry and sulky mood.

""What's the use of being in the country,"" she thought, ""if I must act just as I did in the city? I hate Nurse Holloweg, and Sarah, and all the rest of them! and if I dared I'd just-just run away.""

Indeed, a few minutes later, when Sarah had fallen asleep upon a bench under a big shade tree, Miss Muffet decided she would really run away for once in her life, and see how it seemed.

There was a pretty lane near by, running between shady trees far out into the country, and, stealing softly away from Sarah's side, the little girl ran as fast as she could go, and never stopped until she was all out of breath.

While she rested and wondered what she could do next, a farmer came along, driving an empty cart."
little-miss-muffet,8,"""I'll catch on behind,"" said Miss Muffet, gleefully, ""just as I've seen the boys do in the city. Won't it be fun!""

So she ran and caught on the end of the cart, and actually climbed into it, falling all in a heap upon the straw that lay upon the bottom. But it didn't hurt her at all, and the next minute the farmer whipped up his horses, and they went trotting along the lane, carrying Miss Muffet farther and farther away from hated Nurse Holloweg and the dreadful maids.

She looked around upon the green fields and the waving grain, and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air, and was happy for almost the first time in her little life. By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farm-house, and jumped to the ground."
little-miss-muffet,9,"A woman came to the door to greet him, and he said to her,

""Well, mother, we're home again, you see.""

""So I see,"" she answered; ""but did you bring my groceries?""

""Yes,"" he replied, as he began to unharness the horses; ""they are in the cart.""

So she came to the cart and looked within, and saw Miss Muffet, who was still asleep.

""Where did you get the little girl?"" asked the farmer's wife, in surprise.

""What little girl?"" asked he.

""The one in the cart.""

He came to the cart and looked in, and was as surprised as his wife."
little-miss-muffet,10,"""She must have climbed into the cart when I left the town,"" he said; ""but waken her, wife, and we will hear what she has to say.""

So the farmer's wife shook the girl by the arm, and Miss Muffet sat up in the cart and rubbed her eyes and wondered where she was.

""How came you in my cart?"" asked the farmer.

""I caught on behind, and climbed in,"" answered the girl.

""What is your name, and where do you live?"" enquired the farmer's wife.

""My name is Miss Muffet, and I live in a big city,-but where, I do not know.""

And that was all she could tell them, so the woman said at last,

""We must keep her till some one comes to claim her, and she can earn her living by helping me make the cheeses.""

""That will be nice,"" said Miss Muffet, with a laugh, ""for Nurse Holloweg never lets me do anything, and I should like to help somebody do something."""
little-miss-muffet,11,"So they led her into the house, where the farmer's wife wondered at the fine texture of her dress and admired the golden chain that hung around her neck.

""Some one will surely come for her,"" the woman said to her husband, ""for she is richly dressed and must belong to a family of some importance.""

Nevertheless, when they had eaten dinner, for which Little Miss Muffet had a wonderful appetite, the woman took her into the dairy and told her how she could assist her in curdling the milk and preparing it for the cheese-press.

""Why, it's really fun to work,"" said the girl, at first, ""and I should like to live here always. I do hope Nurse Holloweg will not find me.""

After a time, however, she grew weary, and wanted to rest; but the woman had not yet finished her cheese-making, so she bade the girl keep at her tasks.

""It's time enough to rest when the work is done,"" she said, ""and if you stay with me you must earn your board. No one is allowed to idle in this house.""

So Little Miss Muffet, though she felt like crying and was very tired, kept at her work until at length all was finished and the last cheese was in the press.

""Now,"" said the farmer's wife, ""since you have worked so well I shall give you a dish of curds and whey for your supper, and you may go out into the orchard and eat it under the shade of the trees."""
little-miss-muffet,12,"Little Miss Muffet had never eaten curds and whey before, and did not know how they tasted; but she was very hungry, so she took the dish and went into the orchard.

She first looked around for a place to sit down, and finally discovered a little grassy mound, which is called a tuffet in the country, and seated herself upon it. Then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good.

But while she was eating she chanced to look down at her feet, and there was a great black spider coming straight towards her. The girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous-looking spider before, and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet, spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so. This frightened her more than ever, and as soon as she could get upon her feet she scampered away to the farm-house as fast as she could go, crying bitterly as she ran."
little-miss-muffet,13,"The farmer's wife tried to comfort her, and Miss Muffet, between her sobs, said she had seen ""the awfulest, biggest, blackest spider in all the world!""

This made the woman laugh, for she was not afraid of spiders.

Soon after they heard a sound of wheels upon the road and a handsome carriage came dashing up to the gate.

""Has anyone seen a little girl who has run away?"" asked Nurse Holloweg, leaning out of the carriage.

""Oh, yes,"" answered Little Miss Muffet; ""here I am, Nurse."" And she ran out and jumped into the carriage, for she was very glad to get back again to those who would care for her and not ask her to work making cheeses."
little-miss-muffet,14,"When they were driving back to the town the Nurse said,

""You must promise me, Miss Muffet, never to run away again. You have frightened me nearly into hysterics, and had you been lost your mother would have been quite disappointed.""

The little girl was silent for a time; then she answered,

""I will promise not to run away if you will let me play as other children do. But if you do not allow me to run and romp and dig in the ground, I shall keep running away, no matter how many horrid spiders come to frighten me!"""
little-miss-muffet,15,"And Nurse Holloweg, who had really been much alarmed at so nearly losing her precious charge, thought it wise to agree to Miss Muffet's terms.

She kept her word, too, and when Little Miss Muffet went back to her home in the city her cheeks were as red as roses and her eyes sparkled with health. And she grew, in time, to be a beautiful young lady, and as healthy and robust as she was beautiful. Seeing which, the doctor put an extra large fee in his bill for advising that the little girl be taken to the country; and Mr. Muffet paid it without a word of protest.

Even after Miss Muffet grew up and was married she never forgot the day that she ran away, nor the curds and whey she ate for her supper, nor the great spider that frightened her away from the tuffet."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,1,"John Blessom once upon a time had gone down to Copenhagen to carry on a
suit at law, for in those days one could not get justice in the land of
Norroway; and if a man wanted his rights, there was nothing left for him
to do but to travel to Copenhagen. This is what Blessom had done, and
what his son did after him, for he, too, carried on a law-suit. Now it
chanced that on Christmas Eve John had had speech with the gentleman in
authority, and had attended to his business, and was going along the
street in a low-spirited manner, for he was homesick. And as he went
along, a man from Vaage, in a white blouse, with a knapsack, and buttons
as big as silver dollars, passed him. He was a large, heavily-built man.
It seemed to Blessom that he must know him; but he was walking very
fast."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,2,"""You are walking very fast,"" said John.

""Yes, but then I'm in a hurry,"" answered the man. ""I have to get back to
Vaage this very evening.""

""I only wish that I could get there!"" sighed John.

""You can stand on the runner of my sledge,"" said the man, ""for I have a
horse that covers a mile in twelve steps.""

So they set out, and Blessom had all that he could do to hold fast to
the runner of the sledge; for they went through weather and wind, and he
could see neither heaven nor earth.

Once they stopped and rested. He could not tell exactly where it was,
but when they began to hurry on again, he thought that he spied a skull
on a pole. After they had gone on a while, John Blessom began to freeze."
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,3,"""Alas, I forgot one of my gloves where we stopped, and now my hand is
freezing!"" said he.

""Well, Blessom, you'll have to make the best of it,"" said the man. ""We
are not far from Vaage now. When we stopped to rest we had covered half
the way.""

When they crossed the Finnebridge, the man stopped and set John down.

""Now you are not far from home,"" said he, ""but you must promise me that
you will not look around, when you hear a roaring and notice a flare of
light."""
lord-of-hill-and-john-blessom,4,"John promised, and thanked him for the quick journey. The man drove off
on his way, and John crossed the hill to his home. As he went he heard
a roaring in the Jutulsberg, and the path before him suddenly grew so
bright that one could have picked a needle from the ground. And he
forgot what he had promised, and turned his head to see what was
happening. There stood the giant gate of the Jutulsberg wide open, and
out of it streamed a light and radiance as of thousands of candles. In
the midst of it all stood the giant, and he was the man with whom he
had driven. But from that time forward John's head was twisted, and so
it remained as long as he lived."
master-girl,1,"Once upon a time there was a king who had several sons. I do not just
know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home.
He insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. And in
the end the king had to give him permission to do so. After he had
wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service
with the giant. In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his
goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the
stable in the meantime. ""And when you are through with that, you need
do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have
come to a kind master,"" said he. ""But you must do what you are told to
do conscientiously and, besides, you must not go into any of the rooms
that lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else your life
will pay the forfeit."""
master-girl,2,"""He surely is a kind master,"" said the king's son to himself, walked up
and down the room, and whistled and sang. He thought there would
be plenty of time to clean the stable. ""But it would be nice to take a
look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is
alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he,
and went into the first room. There hung a kettle, and it was boiling,
but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ""What can there be in
it?"" thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair
grew just like copper. ""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will
burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. There hung
another kettle that bubbled and boiled. But there was no fire beneath
it, either. ""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again
he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ""We have
no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main
thing is, how does it taste?"" and with that he went into the third room.
And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling just like those in the
two other rooms, and the king's son wanted to try this one, too. He
dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly
shimmered."
master-girl,3,"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! But if he cooks gold here,
I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" And he wanted to see, so he went
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen. But a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter. Yet whatever she
might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his
days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden.
""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be
your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the
master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard
work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing
more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you
do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten
fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I'll tell you how to go about it. You
must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything
will fly out by itself."""
master-girl,4,"This he would do, said the king's son. He sat there with her all day
long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's
daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not
weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must
clean out the stable before the giant came. When he got there he
thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he
had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop
quickly. After he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in
which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,
whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have
you cleaned out the stable?"" he asked. ""Yes, indeed, master, it is
spick and span,"" said the king's son. ""I'll have to see that,"" said the
giant, and went into the stable. It was just as the king's son had
said. ""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could
not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Master Girl? What is a
Master Girl?"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ""I'd
like to see her, too."" ""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the
giant."
master-girl,5,"The next morning the giant went off again with his goats. And he told
the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he
had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said
he. ""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering
yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his
herd. ""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in
spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl,
for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her.
She asked him what work he had to do that day. ""O, it is not so bad
to-day,"" said the king's son. ""I am only to fetch his horse from the
pasture."" ""And how are you going to manage that?"" asked the Master Girl.
""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the
king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ""Yet it is not an
easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will
tell you how to set about it. When you see the horse, he will come
running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning
pine-torch. Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door,
and throw it into his mouth. Then he will grow so tame that you can
do what you will with him."" He would take good note of it, said the
king's son. He sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long. They chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how
delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if
they could only marry and get away from the giant. And the king's son
would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the
Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. He took the bit that
hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once
ran up, breathing fire and flame. He seized the moment when he came
running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his
mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no
trouble bringing him to the stable. Then he went to his room again, and
began to whistle and sing."
master-girl,6,"In the evening the giant came home with his goats. ""Did you fetch the horse?"" he asked. ""Yes, master,"" said the king's son. ""It would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it straight to the stable."" ""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and
went into the stable. But there stood the horse, just as the king's son
had said. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you
could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Yesterday the master
chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her
again. I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like
to see her,"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very simple and
stupid. ""You will get to see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant."
master-girl,7,"On the third morning the giant went off again with his goats. ""To-day
you must go to the devil, and fetch me his tribute,"" said he to the
king's son. ""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of
the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know
it,"" and with that he went off. ""You may be a kind master,"" said the
king's son. ""Yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of
it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. You claim that
she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to
do,"" and with that he went in to her. And when the Master Girl asked him
what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to
the devil and fetch a tribute. ""But how will you go about it?"" asked the
Master Girl. ""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for
I have never been to the devil's place. Even though I knew the way
there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you
what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind
the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock
with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell
him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him
as much as you can carry."""
master-girl,8,"He would take good note of it, said the king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until evening. He might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before
the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl
had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it.
Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room, whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's
son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is
talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about
her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!""
said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I
will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said
the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" The following day the
giant took him to the Master Girl."
master-girl,9,"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know which one I mean. And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the giant. He lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench.
Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she
could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a
chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung
over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens. She left the
giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible.
After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across. Though where they got the ship, I do not exactly know."
master-girl,10,"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch himself on his bench. ""Is dinner ready yet?"" he asked. ""Just begun!""said the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant turned
around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time.
Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he
said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for
he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop
of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood. The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered him. ""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant, and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner. But there was nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and he did not know whether it were mush or porridge. When he noticed this he began to see a light, and realize how matters had come to pass. He grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do, and made after the king's son and the Master Girl in flying haste."
master-girl,11,"In a short time he came to the sea, and could not cross. ""But I know how to help myself,"" said ahe. ""I will fetch my sea-sucker."" So the sea-sucker came, and lay down and took two or three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that the giant could see the king's son and the Master Girl out on the ship. ""Now you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the king's son did so. It turned into a tremendous large rock square across the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could drink up no more of the sea. ""I know quite well what I must do,"" said the giant. ""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" So the hill-borer came, and bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and keep on sucking. But no sooner were they thus far than the Master Girl told the king's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker could so much as take a single swallow."
master-girl,12,"Now they wanted to go home to the father of the king's son; but he would
not hear of the Master Girl's going afoot, since he did not think this
fitting for either of them. ""Wait here a little while, until I fetch the
seven horses that stand in my father's stable,"" said the king's son. ""It
is not far, and I will soon be back; for I will not have my bride come
marching home afoot."" ""No, do not do so, for when you get home to the
castle you will forget me, I know that positively,"" said the Master
Girl. ""How could I forget you?"" said the king's son. ""We have passed
through so many hardships together, and we love each other so dearly,""
said he. He wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and
she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the Master Girl had to give
in.

""But when you get there, you must not take time to greet a single
person. You must at once go to the stable, harness the horses, and drive
back as swiftly as you can. They will all come to meet you, but you
must act as though you did not see them, and must not take a single bite
to eat. If you do not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,"" said
she. And he promised to do as she had said."
master-girl,13,"But when he got home to the castle, one of his brothers was just getting
married, and the bride and all the guests were already there. They all
crowded around him and asked him this, and asked him that, and wanted to
lead him in. But he acted as though he saw none of them, led out the
horses, and began to put them to the coach. And since they could by no
manner of means induce him to come into the castle, they came out with
food and drink, and offered him the best of all that had been prepared
for the wedding feast.

But the king's son would taste nothing, and only made haste in order to
get away. Yet, finally, the bride's sister rolled an apple over to him
across the court-yard: ""And if you will touch nothing else, then at
least you might take a bite of the apple, for you must be hungry and
thirsty after your long journey,"" said she, and he took the apple and
bit into it. But no sooner did he have the bit of apple in his mouth
than he had forgotten the Master Girl, and that he was to fetch her.
""I think I must be going mad! What am I doing with the horses and the
coach?"" he said, and he led back the horses into the stable, and went
back to the castle, and wanted to marry the bride's sister, the one who
had thrown him the apple."
master-girl,14,"In the meantime the Master Girl sat by the seashore, and waited and
waited; but no king's son came. Then she went on, and after she had gone
a while, she came to a little hut that lay all by itself in the forest,
near the king's castle. She went in and asked whether she might not
stay there. Now the little hut belonged to an old woman, and she was an
arrant and evil witch; at first she did not want to take in the Master
Girl at all; but at last she agreed to do so for love of money. But the
whole hut was as dark and dirty as a pig-sty; therefore the Master Girl
said she would clean up a bit, so that things would look as they did in
other, decent people's houses. The old woman would have none of it, and
was very disagreeable and angry; but the Master Girl paid no attention
to her. She took the chest of gold dust, and threw a handful into the
fire, so that a ray of gold shone over the whole hut, and it was gilded
outside and in. But when the gold flamed up, the old woman was so
terribly frightened that she ran out as though the evil one were after
her, and from pure rage she forgot to duck at the threshold, and ran her
head against the door-post. And that was the end of her."
master-girl,15,"The following morning the bailiff came by. He was much surprised to see
the little golden hut, glittering and sparkling there in the forest, and
was still more surprised at the girl within the hut. He fell in love
with her at once, and asked her whether she would not become the
bailiff's lady. ""Yes, but have you plenty of money?"" said the Master
Girl. Yes, he had quite a little, said the bailiff. Then he went home
to fetch his money, and came back again at evening dragging along an
enormous sack of it, which he stood on a bench before the door. The
Master Girl said that, seeing he had so much money, she would accept
him. And then she asked him to rake the fire, which she said she had
forgotten to do. But as soon as he had the poker in his hand, the Master
Girl cried: ""May God grant that you hold the poker, and the poker hold
you, and that sparks and ashes fly around you until morning!"" And there
the bailiff stood the whole night through, and sparks and ashes flew
about him, nor were the sparks the less hot for all his complaining and
begging. And when morning came, and he could let go the poker, he did
not stay long; but ran off as though the evil one were at his heels. And
those who saw him stared and laughed, for he ran like a madman, and
looked as though he had been thrashed and tanned. And all would have
liked to have known where he had come from, but he said not a word, for
he was ashamed."
master-girl,16,"On the following day the clerk passed by the Master Girl's little house.
He saw it glistening and shining in the woods, and went in to find out
who lived there. When he saw the beautiful girl he fell even more deeply
in love with her than the bailiff had, and lost no time in suing for her
hand. The Master Girl asked him, as she had asked the bailiff, whether
he had plenty of money. Money he had to spare, answered the clerk, and
ran right home to fetch it. By evening he was back again with a great
sack--it must have been as much again as the bailiff had brought--and
stood it on the bench. And so she promised to take him. Then she asked
him to shut the house-door, which she said she had forgotten to do. But
when he had the door-knob in his hand, she cried: ""May God grant that
you hold the door-knob and that the door-knob hold you, and that you
move back and forth with it all night long until morning!"" And the clerk
had to dance the whole night through, such a waltz as he had never
tripped before, and he had no wish to repeat the experience. Sometimes
he was ahead, and sometimes the door was, and so they went back and
forth all night, from wall to post and post to wall, and he was nearly
bruised to death. First he cursed, then he wailed and pleaded; but the
door paid no attention to him, and flung open and shut until it dawned.
When it at last released him, he hurried away as quickly as though he
had stolen something, forgot his sackful of money, and his wish to
marry, and was glad that the door did not come threshing along after
him. All grinned and stared at the clerk, for he ran like a madman, and
looked worse than if a ram had been butting him all night long."
master-girl,17,"On the third day the magistrate came by, and also saw the little golden
house in the forest. And he, too, went in to see who lived in it. And
when he saw the Master Girl, he fell so deeply in love with her that he
sued for her hand as soon as he bade her good-day. But she told him just
what she had told the others, that if he had plenty of money she would
take him. He had money enough, said the magistrate, and he went straight
home to fetch it. When he came back in the evening, he had a much bigger
sack of money with him than the clerk had had, and he stood it on the
bench. Then the Master Girl said she would take him. But first she
asked him to go fetch the calf, which she had forgotten to bring to the
stable. And when he had the calf by the tail she cried: ""May God grant
that you hold the calf's tail, and the calf's tail hold you, and that
you fly about the world together until morning!"" And with that the
race began, over stick and stone, over hill and dale, and the more the
magistrate cursed and yelled, the more madly the calf ran away. When it
dawned there was hardly a whole bone in the magistrate's body, and he
was so happy to be able to let go the calf's tail that he forgot his bag
of money, and the whole occurrence. It is true that he went home more
slowly than the bailiff and the clerk; but the slower he went the more
time the people had to stare and grin at him, so ragged and badly beaten
did he appear after his dance with the calf."
master-girl,18,"On the following day there was to be a wedding at the castle, and not
only was the older prince to marry, but the one who had stayed with the
giant as well, and he was to get the other bride's sister.

But when they entered the coach and were about to drive to church, one
of the axles broke. They took another, and then a third, but all of them
broke, no matter what kind of wood they used. It took a great deal of
time, and they did not move from the spot, and got all out of sorts.
Then the bailiff said, for he had also been invited to the wedding at
the castle, that a maiden lived out in the forest, and ""if they could
only get the loan of her poker, it would be sure to hold."" So they sent
to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the
maiden would not loan them the poker of which the bailiff had spoken.
And they got it, too, and then they had an axle that would not break."
master-girl,19,"But when they wanted to drive on, the bottom of the coach broke. They made a new bottom as well as they were able, but no matter how they put it together, nor what kind of wood they used, it kept on breaking again as soon as they had left the court-yard. And they were worse off than they had been with the axle. Then the clerk said--for if the bailiff was one of the company, you may be sure they had not forgotten to invite the clerk--""Out in the forest lives a maiden, and if you will get the loan of her house-door, I am sure it would not break."" So they sent to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the maiden would not loan them the golden house-door, of which the clerk had told them. And they got it, too, and were about to drive on, when suddenly the horses could not draw the coach. There were six, so they put to eight, and then ten and twelve, but though they put as many as they liked to the coach and helped along with the whip, still the coach would not budge. The day was already far advanced, and they simply had to get to church, and actually began to despair. But then the magistrate said that out in the golden house in the forest lived a maiden, ""and if one could only get the loan of her calf, it would be sure to pull the coach, and though it were as heavy as a bowlder."" They did not think it quite the thing to drive to church with a calf; but still there was nothing to do but to send to the maiden, and to ask her most politely, with a kind greeting from the king, if she would loan them the calf of which the magistrate had spoken. Nor did the Master Girl refuse them this time.
And then, when they had put the calf to the coach, it moved from the
spot quickly enough. It flew over stick and stone, hill and dale, so
that the people inside could hardly catch their breath. First it was
on the ground, and next it was in the air, and when they reached
the church, it spun around it like a top, and they had the greatest
difficulty in getting out and into the church. And going home they went
still faster, and were nearly out of their wits by the time they reached
the castle."
master-girl,20,"When they sat down to the table the king's son--the same who had been at the giant's--said it would be no more than right to invite the maiden, too, who had lent them the poker, and the door and the calf: ""for if we had not had these things, we should not have moved from the spot."" This seemed right to the king, so he sent five of his most distinguished courtiers to the little golden house. They were to carry the king's kindest greetings, and ask that the maiden come up to the castle and take dinner with them. ""A kind greeting to the king, and if he is too good to come to me, then I am too good to go to him,"" said the Master Girl. So the king had to go to her himself, and then she went along with him at once, and the king saw very well that she was more than she appeared to be, and gave her a place at the head of the table, next to the young bridegroom. After they had been at dinner for a while, the Master Girl produced the rooster and the hen and the golden apple--they were the three things she had taken along from the giant's castle--and placed them on the table before her. At once the rooster and the hen began to fight for the golden apple. ""Why, just see how the two fight for the golden apple!"" said the king's son. ""Yes, that is how we had to fight the time we wanted to get out of the rock!"" said the Master Girl. And then the king's son recognized her, and was very happy. The witch who had rolled the apple over to him was duly punished. Then the wedding really began, and the bailiff, and the clerk and the magistrate held out to the very end, for all that their wings had been so
thoroughly singed."
mirror-of-matsuyama,1,"Long years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo, a very remote part of Japan even in these days, a man and his wife. When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter. She was the joy and pride of both their lives. In her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.

What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood. The visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god. Then her first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls and their miniature belongings, to be added to as year succeeded year. Then perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist. It a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind. Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed full. There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family."
mirror-of-matsuyama,2,"One day there was much excitement in the home, for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business. In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of traveling, it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant. The roads were rough and bad, and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way, whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles. Indeed, in those days it was as great an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now."
mirror-of-matsuyama,3,"So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey, knowing what an arduous task lay before him. Vainly she wished that she could accompany him, but the distance was too great for the mother and child to go, and besides that, it was the wife's duty to take care of the home.

All was ready at last, and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.

""Do not be anxious, I will come back soon,"" said the man. ""While I am away take care of everything, and especially of our little daughter.""

""Yes, we shall be all right-but you-you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us,"" said the wife, while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.

The little girl was the only one to smile, for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting. She did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village, which her father did very often. She ran to his side, and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment."
mirror-of-matsuyama,4,"""Father, I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back, so please bring me a present.""

As the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling, eager child, he felt as if some one were pulling him back by the hair, so hard was it for him to leave them behind, for they had never been separated before. But he knew that he must go, for the call was imperative. With a great effort he ceased to think, and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate. His wife, catching up the child in her arms, ran as far as the gate, and watched him as he went down the road between the pines till he was lost in the haze of the distance and all she could see was his quaint peaked hat, and at last that vanished too."
mirror-of-matsuyama,5,"""Now father has gone, you and I must take care of everything till he comes back,"" said the mother, as she made her way back to the house.

""Yes, I will be very good,"" said the child, nodding her head, ""and when father comes home please tell him how good I have been. Then perhaps he will give me a present.""

""Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much. I know, for I asked him to bring you a doll. You must think of father every day, and pray for a safe journey till he comes back.""

""O, yes, when he comes home again how happy I shall be,"" said the child, clapping her hands, and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought. It seemed to the mother as she looked at the child's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper."
mirror-of-matsuyama,6,"Then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them. She set up her simple wooden spinning-wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs. In the intervals of her work she directed the little girl's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country. Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband's absence. While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home, the husband finished his business and returned.

It would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him. He had traveled day after day, exposed to all weathers, for about a month altogether, and was sunburnt to bronze. But his fond wife and child knew him at a glance, and flew to meet him from either side, each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting. Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well. It seemed a very long time to all till-the mother and child helping-his straw sandals were untied, his large umbrella hat taken off, and he was again in their midst in the old familiar sitting-room that had been so empty while he was away."
mirror-of-matsuyama,7,"As soon as they had sat down on the white mats, the father opened a bamboo basket that he had brought in with him, and took out a beautiful doll and a lacquer box full of cakes.

""Here,"" he said to the little girl, ""is a present for you. It is a prize for taking care of mother and the house so well while I was away.""

""Thank you,"" said the child, as she bowed her head to the ground. She then put out her hand just like a little maple leaf with its eager wide-spread fingers to take the doll and the box, both of which, coming from the capital, were prettier than anything she had ever seen. No words can tell how delighted the little girl was-her face seemed as if it would melt with joy, and she had no eyes and no thought for anything else.

Again the husband dived into the basket, and brought out this time a square wooden box, carefully tied up with red and white string, and handing it to his wife, said:

""And this is for you."""
mirror-of-matsuyama,8,"The wife took the box, and opening it carefully took out a metal disk with a handle attached. One side was bright and shining like a crystal, and the other was covered with raised figures of pine-trees and storks, which had been carved out of its smooth surface in lifelike reality. Never had she seen such a thing in her life, for she had been born and bred in the rural province of Echigo. She gazed into the shining disk, and looking up with surprise and wonder pictured on her face, she said:

""I see somebody looking at me in this round thing! What is it that you have given me?""

The husband laughed and said:

""Why, it is your own face that you see. What I have brought you is called a mirror, and whoever looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there. Although there are none to be found in this out of the way place, yet they have been in use in the capital from the most ancient times. There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess. There is an old proverb that 'As the sword is the soul of a samurai, so is the mirror the soul of a woman,' and according to popular tradition, a woman's mirror is an index to her own heart-if she keeps it bright and clear, so is her heart pure and good. It is also one of the treasures that form the insignia of the Emperor. So you must lay great store by your mirror, and use it carefully."""
mirror-of-matsuyama,9,"The wife listened to all her husband told her, and was pleased at learning so much that was new to her. She was still more pleased at the precious gift-his token of remembrance while he had been away.

""If the mirror represents my soul, I shall certainly treasure it as a valuable possession, and never will I use it carelessly."" Saying so, she lifted it as high as her forehead, in grateful acknowledgment of the gift, and then shut it up in its box and put it away.

The wife saw that her husband was very tired, and set about serving the evening meal and making everything as comfortable as she could for him. It seemed to the little family as if they had not known what true happiness was before, so glad were they to be together again, and this evening the father had much to tell of his journey and of all he had seen at the great capital."
mirror-of-matsuyama,10,"Time passed away in the peaceful home, and the parents saw their fondest hopes realized as their daughter grew from childhood into a beautiful girl of sixteen. As a gem of priceless value is held in its proud owner's hand, so had they reared her with unceasing love and care. Now their pains were more than doubly rewarded. What a comfort she was to her mother as she went about the house taking her part in the housekeeping, and how proud her father was of her, for she daily reminded him of her mother when he had first married her.

But, alas! in this world nothing lasts forever. Even the moon is not always perfect in shape, but loses its roundness with time, and flowers bloom and then fade. So at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow. The good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill."
mirror-of-matsuyama,11,"In the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold, and were not particularly anxious. But the days went by and still the mother did not get better. She only grew worse, and the doctor was puzzled, for in spite of all he did the poor woman grew weaker day by day. The father and daughter were stricken with grief, and day or night the girl never left her mother's side. But in spite of all their efforts the woman's life was not to be saved.

One day as the girl sat near her mother's bed, trying to hide with a cheery smile the gnawing trouble at her heart, the mother roused herself and taking her daughter's hand, gazed earnestly and lovingly into her eyes. Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty:

""My daughter. I am sure that nothing can save me now. When I am dead, promise me to take care of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman.""

""Oh, mother,"" said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes, ""you must not say such things. All you have to do is to make haste and get well-that will bring the greatest happiness to father and myself.""

""Yes, I know, and it is a comfort to me in my last days to know how greatly you long for me to get better, but it is not to be. Do not look so sorrowful, for it was so ordained in my previous state of existence that I should die in this life just at this time. Knowing this, I am quite resigned to my fate. And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me when I am gone."""
mirror-of-matsuyama,12,"Putting her hand out, she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with a silken cord and tassels. Undoing this very carefully, she took out of the box the mirror that her husband had given her years ago.

""When you were still a little child your father went up to the capital and brought me back as a present this treasure; it is called a mirror. This I give you before I die. If, after I have ceased to be in this life, you are lonely and long to see me sometimes, then take out this mirror and in the clear and shining surface you will always see me-so will you be able to meet with me often and tell me all your heart. Though I shall not be able to speak, I shall understand and sympathize with you, whatever may happen to you in the future."" With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.

The mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest, and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day."
mirror-of-matsuyama,13,"The bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief, and they abandoned themselves to their bitter sorrow. They felt it to be impossible to take leave of the loved woman who till now had filled their whole lives and to commit her body to the earth. But this frantic burst of grief passed, and then they took possession of their own hearts again, crushed though they were in resignation. In spite of this the daughter's life seemed to her desolate. Her love for her dead mother did not grow less with time, and so keen was her remembrance, that everything in daily life, even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind, reminded her of her mother's death and of all that they had loved and shared together. One day when her father was out, and she was fulfilling her household duties alone, her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear. She threw herself down in her mother's room and wept as if her heart would break. Poor child, she longed just for one glimpse of the loved face, one sound of the voice calling her pet name, or for one moment's forgetfulness of the aching void in her heart. Suddenly she sat up. Her mother's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.

""Oh! my mother told me when she gave me the mirror as a parting gift, that whenever I looked into it I should be able to meet her-to see her. I had nearly forgotten her last words-how stupid I am. I will get the mirror now and see if it can possibly be true!"""
mirror-of-matsuyama,14,"She dried her eyes quickly, and going to the cupboard took out the box that contained the mirror, her heart beating with expectation as she lifted the mirror out and gazed into its smooth face. Behold, her mother's words were true! In the round mirror before her she saw her mother's face; but, oh, the joyful surprise! It was not her mother thin and wasted by illness, but the young and beautiful woman as she remembered her far back in the days of her own earliest childhood. It seemed to the girl that the face in the mirror must soon speak, almost that she heard the voice of her mother telling her again to grow up a good woman and a dutiful daughter, so earnestly did the eyes in the mirror look back into her own.

""It is certainly my mother's soul that I see. She knows how miserable I am without her and she has come to comfort me. Whenever I long to see her she will meet me here; how grateful I ought to be!"""
mirror-of-matsuyama,15,"And from this time the weight of sorrow was greatly lightened for her young heart. Every morning, to gather strength for the day's duties before her, and every evening, for consolation before she lay down to rest, did the young girl take out the mirror and gaze at the reflection which in the simplicity of her innocent heart she believed to be her mother's soul. Daily she grew in the likeness of her dead mother's character, and was gentle and kind to all, and a dutiful daughter to her father.

A year spent in mourning had thus passed away in the little household, when, by the advice of his relations, the man married again, and the daughter now found herself under the authority of a step-mother. It was a trying position; but her days spent in the recollection of her own beloved mother, and of trying to be what that mother would wish her to be, had made the young girl docile and patient, and she now determined to be filial and dutiful to her father's wife, in all respects. Everything went on apparently smoothly in the family for some time under the new regime; there were no winds or waves of discord to ruffle the surface of every-day life, and the father was content."
mirror-of-matsuyama,16,"But it is a woman's danger to be petty and mean, and step-mothers are proverbial all the world over, and this one's heart was not as her first smiles were. As the days and weeks grew into months, the step-mother began to treat the motherless girl unkindly and to try and come between the father and child.

Sometimes she went to her husband and complained of her step-daughter's behavior, but the father knowing that this was to be expected, took no notice of her ill-natured complaints. Instead of lessening his affection for his daughter, as the woman desired, her grumblings only made him think of her the more. The woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before. This did not please her at all, and she began to turn over in her mind how she could, by some means or other, drive her step-child out of the house. So crooked did the woman's heart become."
mirror-of-matsuyama,17,"She watched the girl carefully, and one day peeping into her room in the early morning, she thought she discovered a grave enough sin of which to accuse the child to her father. The woman herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen.

So she went at once to her husband, and wiping away some false tears she said in a sad voice:

""Please give me permission to leave you today.""

The man was completely taken by surprise at the suddenness of her request, and wondered whatever was the matter.

""Do you find it so disagreeable,"" he asked, ""in my house, that you can stay no longer?""

""No! no! it has nothing to do with you-even in my dreams I have never thought that I wished to leave your side; but if I go on living here I am in danger of losing my life, so I think it best for all concerned that you should allow me to go home!"""
mirror-of-matsuyama,18,"And the woman began to weep afresh. Her husband, distressed to see her so unhappy, and thinking that he could not have heard aright, said:

""Tell me what you mean! How is your life in danger here?""

""I will tell you since you ask me. Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother. For some time past she has shut herself up in her room morning and evening, and looking in as I pass by, I am convinced that she has made an image of me and is trying to kill me by magic art, cursing me daily. It is not safe for me to stay here, such being the case; indeed, indeed, I must go away, we cannot live under the same roof any more."""
mirror-of-matsuyama,19,"The husband listened to the dreadful tale, but he could not believe his gentle daughter guilty of such an evil act. He knew that by popular superstition people believed that one person could cause the gradual death of another by making an image of the hated one and cursing it daily; but where had his young daughter learned such knowledge?-the thing was impossible. Yet he remembered having noticed that his daughter stayed much in her room of late and kept herself away from every one, even when visitors came to the house. Putting this fact together with his wife's alarm, he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story.

His heart was torn between doubting his wife and trusting his child, and he knew not what to do. He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth. Comforting his wife and assuring her that her fears were groundless, he glided quietly to his daughter's room."
mirror-of-matsuyama,20,"The girl had for a long time past been very unhappy. She had tried by amiability and obedience to show her goodwill and to mollify the new wife, and to break down that wall of prejudice and misunderstanding that she knew generally stood between step-parents and their step-children. But she soon found that her efforts were in vain. The step-mother never trusted her, and seemed to misinterpret all her actions, and the poor child knew very well that she often carried unkind and untrue tales to her father. She could not help comparing her present unhappy condition with the time when her own mother was alive only a little more than a year ago-so great a change in this short time! Morning and evening she wept over the remembrance. Whenever she could she went to her room, and sliding the screens to, took out the mirror and gazed, as she thought, at her mother's face. It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.

Her father found her occupied in this way. Pushing aside the fusama, he saw her bending over something or other very intently. Looking over her shoulder, to see who was entering her room, the girl was surprised to see her father, for he generally sent for her when he wished to speak to her. She was also confused at being found looking at the mirror, for she had never told any one of her mother's last promise, but had kept it as the sacred secret of her heart. So before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve. Her father noting her confusion, and her act of hiding something, said in a severe manner:

""Daughter, what are you doing here? And what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve?"""
mirror-of-matsuyama,21,"The girl was frightened by her father's severity. Never had he spoken to her in such a tone. Her confusion changed to apprehension, her color from scarlet to white. She sat dumb and shamefaced, unable to reply.

Appearances were certainly against her; the young girl looked guilty, and the father thinking that perhaps after all what his wife had told him was true, spoke angrily:

""Then, is it really true that you are daily cursing your step-mother and praying for her death? Have you forgotten what I told you, that although she is your step-mother you must be obedient and loyal to her? What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked? You have certainly changed, my daughter! What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?""

And the father's eyes filled with sudden tears to think that he should have to upbraid his daughter in this way."
mirror-of-matsuyama,22,"She on her part did not know what he meant, for she had never heard of the superstition that by praying over an image it is possible to cause the death of a hated person. But she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow. She loved her father dearly, and could not bear the idea of his anger. She put out her hand on his knee deprecatingly:

""Father! father! do not say such dreadful things to me. I am still your obedient child. Indeed, I am. However stupid I may be, I should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you, much less pray for the death of one you love. Surely some one has been telling you lies, and you are dazed, and you know not what you say-or some evil spirit has taken possession of YOUR heart. As for me I do not know-no, not so much as a dew-drop, of the evil thing of which you accuse me.""

But the father remembered that she had hidden something away when he first entered the room, and even this earnest protest did not satisfy him. He wished to clear up his doubts once for all."
mirror-of-matsuyama,23,"""Then why are you always alone in your room these days? And tell me what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve-show it to me at once.""

Then the daughter, though shy of confessing how she had cherished her mother's memory, saw that she must tell her father all in order to clear herself. So she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him.

""This,"" she said, ""is what you saw me looking at just now.""

""Why,"" he said in great surprise, ""this is the mirror that I brought as a gift to your mother when I went up to the capital many years ago! And so you have kept it all this time? Now, why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?""

Then she told him of her mother's last words, and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass. But still the father could not understand the simplicity of his daughter's character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in reality her own face, and not that of her mother.

""What do you mean?"" he asked. ""I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror?""

""It is indeed true,"" said the girl: ""and if you don't believe what I say, look for yourself,"" and she placed the mirror before her. There, looking back from the smooth metal disk, was her own sweet face. She pointed to the reflection seriously:

""Do you doubt me still?"" she asked earnestly, looking up into his face.

With an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together."
mirror-of-matsuyama,24,"""How stupid I am! At last I understand. Your face is as like your mother's as the two sides of a melon-thus you have looked at the reflection of your face all this time, thinking that you were brought face to face with your lost mother! You are truly a faithful child. It seems at first a stupid thing to have done, but it is not really so, It shows how deep has been your filial piety, and how innocent your heart. Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character. How clever it was of her to tell you to do this. I admire and respect you, my daughter, and I am ashamed to think that for one instant I believed your suspicious step-mother's story and suspected you of evil, and came with the intention of scolding you severely, while all this time you have been so true and good. Before you I have no countenance left, and I beg you to forgive me.""

And here the father wept. He thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been, and of all that she must have suffered under her step-mother's treatment. His daughter steadfastly keeping her faith and simplicity in the midst of such adverse circumstances-bearing all her troubles with so much patience and amiability-made him compare her to the lotus which rears its blossom of dazzling beauty out of the slime and mud of the moats and ponds, fitting emblem of a heart which keeps itself unsullied while passing through the world."
mirror-of-matsuyama,25,"The step-mother, anxious to know what would happen, had all this while been standing outside the room. She had grown interested, and had gradually pushed the sliding screen back till she could see all that went on. At this moment she suddenly entered the room, and dropping to the mats, she bowed her head over her outspread hands before her step-daughter.

""I am ashamed! I am ashamed!"" she exclaimed in broken tones. ""I did not know what a filial child you were. Through no fault of yours, but with a step-mother's jealous heart, I have disliked you all the time. Hating you so much myself, it was but natural that I should think you reciprocated the feeling, and thus when I saw you retire so often to your room I followed you, and when I saw you gaze daily into the mirror for long intervals, I concluded that you had found out how I disliked you, and that you were out of revenge trying to take my life by magic art. As long as I live I shall never forget the wrong I have done you in so misjudging you, and in causing your father to suspect you. From this day I throw away my old and wicked heart, and in its place I put a new one, clean and full of repentance. I shall think of you as a child that I have borne myself. I shall love and cherish you with all my heart, and thus try to make up for all the unhappiness I have caused you. Therefore, please throw into the water all that has gone before, and give me, I beg of you, some of the filial love that you have hitherto given to your own lost mother."""
mirror-of-matsuyama,26,"Thus did the unkind step-mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged.

Such was the sweetness of the girl's disposition that she willingly forgave her step-mother, and never bore a moment's resentment or malice towards her afterwards. The father saw by his wife's face that she was truly sorry for the past, and was greatly relieved to see the terrible misunderstanding wiped out of remembrance by both the wrong-doer and the wronged.

From this time on, the three lived together as happily as fish in water. No such trouble ever darkened the home again, and the young girl gradually forgot that year of unhappiness in the tender love and care that her step-mother now bestowed on her. Her patience and goodness were rewarded at last."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,1,"Long, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman; they were
peasants, and had to work hard to earn their daily rice. The old man
used to go and cut grass for the farmers around, and while he was gone
the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their
own little rice field."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,2,"One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old
woman took some clothes to the river to wash.

It was nearly summer, and the country was very beautiful to see in its
fresh greenness as the two old people went on their way to work. The
grass on the banks of the river looked like emerald velvet, and the
pussy willows along the edge of the water were shaking out their soft
tassels."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,3,"The breezes blew and ruffled the smooth surface of the water into
wavelets, and passing on touched the cheeks of the old couple who, for
some reason they could not explain, felt very happy that morning."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,4,"The old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her
basket down. Then she set to work to wash the clothes; she took them
one by one out of the basket and washed them in the river and rubbed
them on the stones. The water was as clear as crystal, and she could
see the tiny fish swimming to and fro, and the pebbles at the bottom."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,5,"As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the
stream. The old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach.
She was sixty years of age, yet in all her life she had never seen such
a big peach as this."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,6,"""How delicious that peach must be!"" she said to herself. ""I must
certainly get it and take it home to my old man.""

She stretched out her arm to try and get it, but it was quite out of
her reach. She looked about for a stick, but there was not one to be
seen, and if she went to look for one she would lose the peach."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,7,"Stopping a moment to think what she would do, she remembered an old
charm-verse. Now she began to clap her hands to keep time to the
rolling of the peach down stream, and while she clapped she sang this
song:

  ""Distant water is bitter,
   The near water is sweet;
   Pass by the distant water
   And come into the sweet."""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,8,"Strange to say, as soon as she began to repeat this little song the
peach began to come nearer and nearer the bank where the old woman was
standing, till at last it stopped just in front of her so that she was
able to take it up in her hands. The old woman was delighted. She could
not go on with her work, so happy and excited was she, so she put all
the clothes back in her bamboo basket, and with the basket on her back
and the peach in her hand she hurried homewards."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,9,"It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned.
The old man at last came back as the sun was setting, with a big bundle
of grass on his back--so big that he was almost hidden and she could
hardly see him. He seemed very tired and used the scythe for a walking
stick, leaning on it as he walked along."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,10,"As soon as the old woman saw him she called out:

""O Fii San! (old man) I have been waiting for you to come home for such
a long time to-day!""

""What is the matter? Why are you so impatient?"" asked the old man,
wondering at her unusual eagerness. ""Has anything happened while I have
been away?""

""Oh, no!"" answered the old woman, ""nothing has happened, only I have
found a nice present for you!""

""That is good,"" said the old man. He then washed his feet in a basin of
water and stepped up to the veranda."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,11,"The old woman now ran into the little room and brought out from the
cupboard the big peach. It felt even heavier than before. She held it
up to him, saying:

""Just look at this! Did you ever see such a large peach in all your
life?""

When the old man looked at the peach he was greatly astonished and said:

""This is indeed the largest peach I have ever seen! Wherever did you
buy it?""

""I did not buy it,"" answered the old woman. ""I found it in the river
where I was washing."" And she told him the whole story."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,12,"""I am very glad that you have found it. Let us eat it now, for I am
hungry,"" said the O Fii San.

He brought out the kitchen knife, and, placing the peach on a board,
was about to cut it when, wonderful to tell, the peach split in two of
itself and a clear voice said:

""Wait a bit, old man!"" and out stepped a beautiful little child.

The old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that
they fell to the ground. The child spoke again:

""Don't be afraid. I am no demon or fairy. I will tell you the truth.
Heaven has had compassion on you. Every day and every night you have
lamented that you had no child. Your cry has been heard and I am sent
to be the son of your old age!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,13,"On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy. They had
cried night and day for sorrow at having no child to help them in their
lonely old age, and now that their prayer was answered they were so
lost with joy that they did not know where to put their hands or their
feet. First the old man took the child up in his arms, and then the old
woman did the same; and they named him MOMOTARO, OR SON OF A PEACH,
because he had come out of a peach."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,14,"The years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of
age. He was taller and far stronger than any other boys of his own age,
he had a handsome face and a heart full of courage, and he was very
wise for his years. The old couple's pleasure was very great when they
looked at him, for he was just what they thought a hero ought to be
like."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,15,"One day Momotaro came to his foster-father and said solemnly:

""Father, by a strange chance we have become father and son. Your
goodness to me has been higher than the mountain grasses which it was
your daily work to cut, and deeper than the river where my mother
washes the clothes. I do not know how to thank you enough."""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,16,"""Why,"" answered the old man, ""it is a matter of course that a father
should bring up his son. When you are older it will be your turn to
take care of us, so after all there will be no profit or loss between
us--all will be equal. Indeed, I am rather surprised that you should
thank me in this way!"" and the old man looked bothered."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,17,"""I hope you will be patient with me,"" said Momotaro; ""but before I
begin to pay back your goodness to me I have a request to make which I
hope you will grant me above everything else.""

""I will let you do whatever you wish, for you are quite different to
all other boys!""

""Then let me go away at once!""

""What do you say? Do you wish to leave your old father and mother and
go away from your old home?""

""I will surely come back again, if you let me go now!""

""Where are you going?"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,18,"""You must think it strange that I want to go away,"" said Momotaro,
""because I have not yet told you my reason. Far away from here to the
northeast of Japan there is an island in the sea. This island is the
stronghold of a band of devils. I have often heard how they invade this
land, kill and rob the people, and carry off all they can find. They
are not only very wicked but they are disloyal to our Emperor and
disobey his laws. They are also cannibals, for they kill and eat some
of the poor people who are so unfortunate as to fall into their hands.
These devils are very hateful beings. I must go and conquer them and
bring back all the plunder of which they have robbed this land. It is
for this reason that I want to go away for a short time!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,19,"The old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of
fifteen. He thought it best to let the boy go. He was strong and
fearless, and besides all this, the old man knew he was no common
child, for he had been sent to them as a gift from Heaven, and he felt
quite sure that the devils would be powerless to harm him."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,20,"""All you say is very interesting, Momotaro,"" said the old man. ""I will
not hinder you in your determination. You may go if you wish. Go to the
island as soon as ever you like and destroy the demons and bring peace
to the land.""

""Thank you, for all your kindness,"" said Momotaro, who began to get
ready to go that very day. He was full of courage and did not know what
fear was."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,21,"The old man and woman at once set to work to pound rice in the kitchen
mortar to make cakes for Momotaro to take with him on his journey.

At last the cakes were made and Momotaro was ready to start on his long
journey."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,22,"Parting is always sad. So it was now. The eyes of the two old people
were filled with tears and their voices trembled as they said:

""Go with all care and speed. We expect you back victorious!""

Momotaro was very sorry to leave his old parents (though he knew he was
coming back as soon as he could), for he thought of how lonely they
would be while he was away. But he said ""Good-by!"" quite bravely."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,23,"""I am going now. Take good care of yourselves while I am away.
Good-by!"" And he stepped quickly out of the house. In silence the eyes
of Momotaro and his parents met in farewell."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,24,"Momotaro now hurried on his way till it was midday. He began to feel
hungry, so he opened his bag and took out one of the rice-cakes and sat
down under a tree by the side of the road to eat it. While he was thus
having his lunch a dog almost as large as a colt came running out from
the high grass. He made straight for Momotaro, and showing his teeth,
said in a fierce way:

""You are a rude man to pass my field without asking permission first.
If you leave me all the cakes you have in your bag you may go;
otherwise I will bite you till I kill you!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,25,"Momotaro only laughed scornfully:

""What is that you are saying? Do you know who I am? I am Momotaro, and
I am on my way to subdue the devils in their island stronghold in the
northeast of Japan. If you try to stop me on my way there I will cut
you in two from the head downwards!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,26,"The dog's manner at once changed. His tail dropped between his legs,
and coming near he bowed so low that his forehead touched the ground.

""What do I hear? The name of Momotaro? Are you indeed Momotaro? I have
often heard of your great strength. Not knowing who you were I have
behaved in a very stupid way. Will you please pardon my rudeness? Are
you indeed on your way to invade the Island of Devils? If you will take
such a rude fellow with you as one of your followers, I shall be very
grateful to you."""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,27,"""I think I can take you with me if you wish to go,"" said Momotaro.

""Thank you!"" said the dog. ""By the way, I am very very hungry. Will you
give me one of the cakes you are carrying?""

""This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan,"" said Momotaro. ""I
cannot spare you a whole one; I will give you half of one.""

""Thank you very much,"" said the dog, taking the piece thrown to him."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,28,"Then Momotaro got up and the dog followed. For a long time they walked
over the hills and through the valleys. As they were going along an
animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them. The creature soon
came up to Momotaro and said:

""Good morning, Momotaro! You are welcome in this part of the country.
Will you allow me to go with you?"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,29,"The dog answered jealously:

""Momotaro already has a dog to accompany him. Of what use is a monkey
like you in battle? We are on our way to fight the devils! Get away!""

The dog and the monkey began to quarrel and bite, for these two animals
always hate each other."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,30,"""Now, don't quarrel!"" said Momotaro, putting himself between them.
""Wait a moment, dog!""

""It is not at all dignified for you to have such a creature as that
following you!"" said the dog.

""What do you know about it?"" asked Momotaro; and pushing aside the dog,
he spoke to the monkey:

""Who are you?""

""I am a monkey living in these hills,"" replied the monkey. ""I heard of
your expedition to the Island of Devils, and I have come to go with
you. Nothing will please me more than to follow you!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,31,"""Do you really wish to go to the Island of Devils and fight with me?""

""Yes, sir,"" replied the monkey.

""I admire your courage,"" said Momotaro. ""Here is a piece of one of my
fine rice-cakes. Come along!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,32,"So the monkey joined Momotaro. The dog and the monkey did not get on
well together. They were always snapping at each other as they went
along, and always wanting to have a fight. This made Momotaro very
cross, and at last he sent the dog on ahead with a flag and put the
monkey behind with a sword, and he placed himself between them with a
war-fan, which is made of iron."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,33,"By and by they came to a large field. Here a bird flew down and
alighted on the ground just in front of the little party. It was the
most beautiful bird Momotaro had ever seen. On its body were five
different robes of feathers and its head was covered with a scarlet cap."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,34,"The dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it. But the
bird struck out its spurs and flew at the dog's tail, and the fight
went hard with both.

Momotaro, as he looked on, could not help admiring the bird; it showed
so much spirit in the fight. It would certainly make a good fighter."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,35,"Momotaro went up to the two combatants, and holding the dog back, said
to the bird:

""You rascal! you are hindering my journey. Surrender at once, and I
will take you with me. If you don't I will set this dog to bite your
head off!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,36,"Then the bird surrendered at once, and begged to be taken into
Momotaro's company.

""I do not know what excuse to offer for quarreling with the dog, your
servant, but I did not see you. I am a miserable bird called a
pheasant. It is very generous of you to pardon my rudeness and to take
me with you. Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the
monkey!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,37,"""I congratulate you on surrendering so soon,"" said Momotaro, smiling.
""Come and join us in our raid on the devils.""

""Are you going to take this bird with you also?"" asked the dog,
interrupting.

""Why do you ask such an unnecessary question? Didn't you hear what I
said? I take the bird with me because I wish to!""

""Humph!"" said the dog."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,38,"Then Momotaro stood and gave this order:

""Now all of you must listen to me. The first thing necessary in an army
is harmony. It is a wise saying which says that 'Advantage on earth is
better than advantage in Heaven!' Union amongst ourselves is better
than any earthly gain. When we are not at peace amongst ourselves it is
no easy thing to subdue an enemy. From now, you three, the dog, the
monkey and the pheasant, must be friends with one mind. The one who
first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,39,"All the three promised not to quarrel. The pheasant was now made a
member of Momotaro's suite, and received half a cake.

Momotaro's influence was so great that the three became good friends,
and hurried onwards with him as their leader."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,40,"Hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the
North-Eastern Sea. There was nothing to be seen as far as the
horizon--not a sign of any island. All that broke the stillness was the
rolling of the waves upon the shore."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,41,"Now, the dog and the monkey and the pheasant had come very bravely all
the way through the long valleys and over the hills, but they had never
seen the sea before, and for the first time since they set out they
were bewildered and gazed at each other in silence. How were they to
cross the water and get to the Island of Devils?"
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,42,"Momotaro soon saw that they were daunted by the sight of the sea, and
to try them he spoke loudly and roughly:

""Why do you hesitate? Are you afraid of the sea? Oh! what cowards you
are! It is impossible to take such weak creatures as you with me to
fight the demons. It will be far better for me to go alone. I discharge
you all at once!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,43,"The three animals were taken aback at this sharp reproof, and clung to
Momotaro's sleeve, begging him not to send them away.

""Please, Momotaro!"" said the dog.

""We have come thus far!"" said the monkey.

""It is inhuman to leave us here!"" said the pheasant.

""We are not at all afraid of the sea,"" said the monkey again.

""Please do take us with you,"" said the pheasant.

""Do please,"" said the dog.

They had now gained a little courage, so Momotaro said:

""Well, then, I will take you with me, but be careful!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,44,"Momotaro now got a small ship, and they all got on board. The wind and
weather were fair, and the ship went like an arrow over the sea. It was
the first time they had ever been on the water, and so at first the
dog, the monkey and the pheasant were frightened at the waves and the
rolling of the vessel, but by degrees they grew accustomed to the water
and were quite happy again. Every day they paced the deck of their
little ship, eagerly looking out for the demons' island."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,45,"When they grew tired of this, they told each other stories of all their
exploits of which they were proud, and then played games together; and
Momotaro found much to amuse him in listening to the three animals and
watching their antics, and in this way he forgot that the way was long
and that he was tired of the voyage and of doing nothing. He longed to
be at work killing the monsters who had done so much harm in his
country."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,46,"As the wind blew in their favor and they met no storms the ship made a
quick voyage, and one day when the sun was shining brightly a sight of
land rewarded the four watchers at the bow."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,47,"Momotaro knew at once that what they saw was the devils' stronghold. On
the top of the precipitous shore, looking out to sea, was a large
castle. Now that his enterprise was close at hand, he was deep in
thought with his head leaning on his hands, wondering how he should
begin the attack. His three followers watched him, waiting for orders.
At last he called to the pheasant:

""It is a great advantage for us to have you with us."" said Momotaro to
the bird, ""for you have good wings. Fly at once to the castle and
engage the demons to fight. We will follow you."""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,48,"The pheasant at once obeyed. He flew off from the ship beating the air
gladly with his wings. The bird soon reached the island and took up his
position on the roof in the middle of the castle, calling out loudly:

""All you devils listen to me! The great Japanese general Momotaro has
come to fight you and to take your stronghold from you. If you wish to
save your lives surrender at once, and in token of your submission you
must break off the horns that grow on your forehead. If you do not
surrender at once, but make up your mind to fight, we, the pheasant,
the dog and the monkey, will kill you all by biting and tearing you to
death!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,49,"The horned demons looking up and only seeing a pheasant, laughed and
said:

""A wild pheasant, indeed! It is ridiculous to hear such words from a
mean thing like you. Wait till you get a blow from one of our iron
bars!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,50,"Very angry, indeed, were the devils. They shook their horns and their
shocks of red hair fiercely, and rushed to put on tiger skin trousers
to make themselves look more terrible. They then brought out great iron
bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads, and tried
to knock him down. The pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow,
and then attacked the head of first one and then another demon. He flew
round and round them, beating the air with his wings so fiercely and
ceaselessly, that the devils began to wonder whether they had to fight
one or many more birds."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,51,"In the meantime, Momotaro had brought his ship to land. As they had
approached, he saw that the shore was like a precipice, and that the
large castle was surrounded by high walls and large iron gates and was
strongly fortified."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,52,"Momotaro landed, and with the hope of finding some way of entrance,
walked up the path towards the top, followed by the monkey and the dog.
They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream.
Momotaro saw that the clothes were blood-stained, and that as the two
maidens washed, the tears were falling fast down their cheeks. He
stopped and spoke to them:

""Who are you, and why do you weep?""

""We are captives of the Demon King. We were carried away from our homes
to this island, and though we are the daughters of Daimios (Lords), we
are obliged to be his servants, and one day he will kill us""--and the
maidens held up the blood-stained clothes--""and eat us, and there is no
one to help us!"""
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,53,"And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought.

""I will rescue you,"" said Momotaro. ""Do not weep any more, only show me
how I may get into the castle.""

Then the two ladies led the way and showed Momotaro a little back door
in the lowest part of the castle wall--so small that Momotaro could
hardly crawl in."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,54,"The pheasant, who was all this time fighting hard, saw Momotaro and his
little band rush in at the back.

Momotaro's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand
against him. At first their foe had been a single bird, the pheasant,
but now that Momotaro and the dog and the monkey had arrived they were
bewildered, for the four enemies fought like a hundred, so strong were
they. Some of the devils fell off the parapet of the castle and were
dashed to pieces on the rocks beneath; others fell into the sea and
were drowned; many were beaten to death by the three animals."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,55,"The chief of the devils at last was the only one left. He made up his
mind to surrender, for he knew that his enemy was stronger than mortal
man.

He came up humbly to Momotaro and threw down his iron bar, and kneeling
down at the victor's feet he broke off the horns on his head in token
of submission, for they were the sign of his strength and power."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,56,"""I am afraid of you,"" he said meekly. ""I cannot stand against you. I
will give you all the treasure hidden in this castle if you will spare
my life!""

Momotaro laughed."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,57,"""It is not like you, big devil, to beg for mercy, is it? I cannot spare
your wicked life, however much you beg, for you have killed and
tortured many people and robbed our country for many years.""

Then Momotaro tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkey's
charge. Having done this, he went into all the rooms of the castle and
set the prisoners free and gathered together all the treasure he found."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,58,"The dog and the pheasant carried home the plunder, and thus Momotaro
returned triumphantly to his home, taking with him the devil chief as a
captive."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,59,"The two poor damsels, daughters of Daimios, and others whom the wicked
demon had carried off to be his slaves, were taken safely to their own
homes and delivered to their parents.

The whole country made a hero of Momotaro on his triumphant return, and
rejoiced that the country was now freed from the robber devils who had
been a terror of the land for a long time."
momotaro-story-of-son-of-peach,60,"The old couple's joy was greater than ever, and the treasure Momotaro
had brought home with him enabled them to live in peace and plenty to
the end of their days."
money-box,1,"In a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through. Indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence. The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain. There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room."
money-box,2,"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about. A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open. She called out to the others, ""Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at."""
money-box,3,"Upon this there was a great uproar. Even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement. They showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. ""Each has its own value,"" said the wagon; ""we cannot all be noblemen. There must be some to do the work."""
money-box,4,"The money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message. But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home. They were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. The rocking-horse spoke of training and races. The wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them. The clock talked politics--""tick, tick;"" he professed to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly."
money-box,5,"The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud. He was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid. When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw. But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married. ""I crack for everybody,"" said the cracker.  ""Yes, and a fine noise you make,"" thought the audience, as the play went on."
money-box,6,"It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side. The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play."
money-box,7,"All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking. His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time--of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. Certainly sooner than he expected--for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces. Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner. The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle. This was the beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story."
morraha,1,"Morraha rose in the morning, and washed his hands and face, and said his
prayers, and ate his food. He asked God to prosper the day for him;
and he went down to the brink of the sea, and he saw a currach, short
and green, coming towards him. In it there was but one youthful
champion, and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach. He had
a hurl of gold and a ball of silver. He stopped not until the
currach was in on the shore. He drew her up on the green grass, and
put fastening on her for a day and a year, whether he should be there
all that time, or should only be on land for an hour by the clock. And
Morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent, intelligible, such
as were spoken at that time. The other saluted him in the same
fashion, and asked him would he play a game of cards with him; and
Morraha said he had not the wherewithal. The other answered that he
was never without a candle or the making of it. He put his hand in
his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards, and
they sat down on the chairs and went to the card-playing. The first game
Morraha won, and the slender red champion bade him make his claim. He said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in
the morning. It was well, and he played no second game, but home he
went.

The next day Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and the young man
came in the currach and asked him would he play cards. They played,
and Morraha won. And the young man bade him make his claim. He said
that the land above should be filled with cattle in the morning. It was
well, and he played no other game, but went home."
morraha,2,"And on the third morning Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and he
saw the young man coming. And he drew up his boat on the shore, and
asked him would he play cards. And they played, and Morraha won the
game. The young man bade him give his claim. And he said he should
have a castle, and of women the finest and fairest; and they were his.
It was well, and the young man went away.

On the fourth day the woman asked him how he had found himself, and he
told her. ""And I am going out,"" said he, ""to play again to-day.""

""I cross (forbid) you go again to him. If you have won so much, you
will lose more. Have no more to do with him.""

But he went against her will, and he saw the currach coming, and the
young man was driving his balls from end to end of the currach. He had
balls of silver and a hurl of gold, and he stopped not till he drew his
boat on the shore, and made her fast for a year and a day. And Morraha
and he saluted each other. He asked Morraha if he would play a game
of cards, and they played and he won. And Morraha said to him, ""Give
your claim, now.""

Said he, ""You will hear it too soon. I lay on you the bonds of the art
of the Druid not to sleep two nights in one house, nor finish a second
meal at the one table, till you bring me the sword of light and news of
the death of Anshgayliacht."""
morraha,3,"He went down to his wife, and sat down in a chair, and gave a groan, and
the chair broke in pieces.

""It is the son of a king under spells you are,"" said his wife, ""And you
had better have taken my counsel than that the spells should be on you.""
He said to her to bring news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword
of light to the slender red champion.

""Go out,"" said she, ""in the morning of the morrow, and take the bridle
in the window and shake it. Whatever beast, handsome or ugly, puts
the head in it, take that one with you. Do not speak a word to her till
she speaks to you. Take with you three pint bottles of ale and three
sixpenny loaves, and do the thing she tells you. When she runs to my
father's land, on a height above the court, she will shake herself, and
the bells will ring, and my father will say Brown Allree is in the land.
And if the son of a king or queen is there, bring him to me on your
shoulders. If it is the son of a poor man, let him come no further.""

He rose in the morning, and took the bridle that was in the window and
went out and shook it, and Brown Allree came and put her head in it. And
he took the three loaves and three bottles of ale, and went riding. When he was riding, she bent her head down to take hold of her feet with
her mouth, in hopes he would speak in ignorance. He spoke not a word
during the time, and the mare at last spoke to him, and said to him to
dismount and give her her dinner. He gave her the sixpenny loaf toasted
and a bottle of ale to drink. ""Sit up, now, riding and take good heed of
yourself: there are three miles of fire I have to clear at a leap."""
morraha,4,"She cleared the three miles of fire at a leap, and asked if he were
riding, and he said he was. They went on then, and she told him to
dismount and give her a meal. He did so, and gave her a sixpenny
loaf and a bottle. She consumed them, and said to him there were
before them three miles of hill covered with steel thistles, and that
she must clear it. And she cleared the hill with a leap, and she asked
him if he were still riding, and he said he was. They went on, and she
went not far before she told him to give her a meal, and he gave her the
bread and the bottleful. And she went over three miles of sea with a
leap, and she came then to the land of the King of France. She went
up on a height above the castle, and she shook herself and neighed, and
the bells rang. The King said that it was Brown Allree was in the
land. ""Go out,"" said he, ""and if it is the son of a king or queen, carry
him in on your shoulders; if it is not, leave him there.""

They went out, and the stars of the son of a king were on his breast;
and they lifted him high on their shoulders and bore him in to the King.
And they passed the night cheerfully with playing and with drinking,
with sport and with diversion, till the whiteness of the day came upon
the morrow morning.

Then the young King told the cause of his journey, and he asked of the
Queen her counsel and consent, and to give him counsel and good luck,
and the woman told him everything she advised him to do. ""Go now,"" said
she, ""and take with you the best mare in the stable, and go to the door
of Rough Niall of the speckled rock, and knock, and call on him to give
you news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword of light; and let
the horse's back be to the door, and apply the spurs, and away with
you!"""
morraha,5,"And in the morning he did so, and he took the best horse from the stable
and rode to the door of Niall, and turned the horse's back to the door,
and demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light. He applied the spurs, and away with him. And Niall followed him, and
as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two. And the mother was
there with a dish of puddings and flesh, and she threw it in his eyes
and blinded him, and said, ""Fool, whatever kind of man it is that's
mocking you, isn't that a fine condition you have got into on your
father's horse?""

On the morning of the next day Morraha rose and took another horse from
the stable, and went again to the door of Niall, and knocked and
demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light, and
applied the spurs to the horse, and away with him. And Niall followed,
and as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two, and took half the
saddle with him, and his mother met him, and threw the flesh in his eyes
and blinded him.

And on the third day Morraha went also to the door of Niall. Niall
followed him, and as he was passing the gate cut away the saddle from
under him and the clothes from his back. Then his mother said to Niall:

""Whatever fool it is that's mocking you, he is out yonder in the little
currach, going home; and take good heed to yourself, and don't sleep one
wink for three days.""

And for three days the little currach was there before him, and then his
mother came to him and said:

""Sleep as much as you want now. He is gone."""
morraha,6,"And he went to sleep, and there was heavy sleep on him, and Morraha went
in and took hold of the sword that was on the bed at his head. And the
sword thought to draw itself out of the hand of Morraha, but it failed.
And then it gave a cry, and it wakened Niall, and Niall said it was a
rude and rough thing to come into his house like that. Morraha said
to him:

""Leave your much talking, or I will cut the head off you. Tell me the
news of the death of Anshgayliacht.""

""Oh, you can have my head.""

""But your head is no good to me. Tell me the story.""

""Oh,"" said Niall's wife, ""you must get the story.""

""Oh,"" said Morraha, ""is the woman your wife?""

""Oh,"" said the man, ""is it not you that have the story?""

""Oh,"" said she, ""you will tell it to us.""

""Well,"" said the man, ""let us sit down together till I tell the story. I
thought no one would ever get it, but now it will be heard by all.""

When I was growing up my mother taught me the language of the birds, and
when I got married I used to be listening to their conversation. I
would be laughing, and my wife would be asking me what was the reason of
my laughing. I did not like to tell her, as women are always asking
questions. We went out walking one fine morning, and the birds were
arguing with one another. One of them said to another:

""Why should you be making comparison with me, when there is not a king
nor knight that does not come to look at my tree?"""
morraha,7,"""Oh, what advantage has your tree over mine, on which there are three
rods of magic and mastery growing?""

When I heard them arguing, and knew that the rods were there, I began to
laugh.

""Oh,"" said my wife, ""why are you always laughing? I believe it is at
myself you are jesting, and I'll walk with you no more.""

""Oh, it is not about you I am laughing. It is because I understand the
language of the birds.""

Then I had to tell her what the birds were saying to one another. She was greatly delighted, and she asked me to go home, and she gave
orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the
morning. I did not know why she was going out early, and breakfast was
ready in the morning at the hour she appointed. She asked me to go out
walking. I went with her. She went to the tree, and asked me to cut a
rod for her.

""Oh, I will not cut it. Are we not better without it?""

""I will not leave this till I get the rod, to see if there is any good
in it.""

I cut the rod, and gave it to her. She turned from me, and struck a blow
on a stone and changed it. She struck a second blow on me, and made
of me a black raven, and she went home, and left me after her. I thought
she would come back. She did not come, and I had to go into a tree till
morning. In the morning, at six o'clock, there was a bellman out,
proclaiming that everyone who killed a raven would get a fourpenny bit.
At last you would not find man or boy without a gun, nor, if you were to
walk three miles, a raven that was not killed. I had to make a nest in
the top of the parlour chimney, and hide myself all day till night came,
and go out to pick up a bit to support me, till I spent a month. Here
she is herself (to say) if it is a lie I am telling.

""It is not,"" said she."
morraha,8,"Then I saw her out walking. I went up to her, and I thought she would
turn me back to my own shape, and she struck me with the rod and made of
me an old white horse. She ordered me to be put to a cart with a man
to draw stones from morning till night. I was worse off then. She
spread abroad a report that I had died suddenly in my bed, and prepared
a coffin, and waked me, and buried me. Then she had no trouble. But when
I got tired, I began to kill everyone who came near me, and I used to go
into the haggard every night and destroy the stacks of corn. When a
man came near me in the morning, I would follow him till I broke his
bones. Everyone got afraid of me. When she saw I was doing mischief, she
came to meet me, and I thought she would change me. And she did change
me, and made a fox of me. When I saw she was doing me every sort of
damage, I went away from her. I knew there was a badger's hole in the
garden, and I went there till night came, and I made great slaughter
among the ducks and geese. There she is herself to say if I am telling a
lie.

""Oh, you are telling nothing but the truth, only less than the truth.""

When she had enough of my killing the fowl, she came out into the
garden, for she knew I was in the badger's hole. She came to me, and
made me a wolf. I had to be off, and go to an island, where no one at
all would see me, and now and then I used to be killing sheep, for there
were not many of them, and I was afraid of being seen and hunted; and so
I passed a year, till a shepherd saw me among the sheep, and a pursuit
was made after me. And when the dogs came near me, there was no place
for me to escape to from them; but I recognised the sign of the King
among the men, and I made for him, and the King cried out to stop the
hounds. I took a leap upon the front of the King's saddle, and the woman
behind cried out, ""My King and my lord, kill him, or he will kill you."""
morraha,9,"""Oh, he will not kill me. He knew me; and must be pardoned.""

And the King took me home with him, and gave orders that I should be
well cared for. I was so wise when I got food I would not eat one morsel
until I got a knife and fork. The man told the King, and the King came
to see if it was true, and I got a knife and fork, and I took the knife
in one paw and the fork in the other, and I bowed to the King. The King
gave orders to bring him drink, and it came; and the King filled a glass
of wine, and gave it to me.

I took hold of it in my paw, and drank it, and thanked the King.

""Oh, on my honour, it is some king that has lost him when he came on the
island; and I will keep him, as he is trained. Perhaps he will
serve us yet.""

And this is the sort of King he was--a King who had not a child living.
Eight sons were born to him and three daughters, and they were stolen
the same night they were born. No matter what guard was placed over
them, the child would be gone in the morning. The Queen was now carrying
the twelfth child, and when she was lying-in, the King took me with him
to watch the baby. The women were not satisfied with me. ""Oh,"" said the
King, ""what was all your watching ever? One that was born to me I have
not; and I will leave this one in the dog's care, and he will not let it
go."""
morraha,10,"A coupling was put between me and the cradle, and when everyone went to
sleep I was watching till the person woke who attended in the daytime;
but I was there only two nights when, it was near the day, I saw the
hand coming down through the chimney, and the hand was so big that it
took round the child altogether, and thought to take him away. I caught
hold of the hand above the wrist, and, as I was fastened to the cradle,
I did not let go my hold till I cut the hand from the wrist, and there
was a howl from the person without. I laid the hand in the cradle with
the child, and, as I was tired, I fell asleep. When I awoke I had
neither child nor hand. I began to howl, and the King heard me, and
he cried out that something was wrong with me, and he sent servants to
see what was the matter with me, and when the messenger came he saw me
covered with blood, and he could not see the child. He went to the
King, and told him the child was not to be got. The King came, and saw
the cradle coloured with the blood, and he cried out, ""Where was the
child gone?"" and everyone said it was the dog had eaten it.

The King said, ""It is not: loose him, and he will get the pursuit
himself.""

When I was loosed, I found the scent of the blood till I came to a door
of the room in which the child was. I went to the King, and took hold of
him, and went back again, and began to tear at the door. The King
followed me, and asked for the key. The servant said it was in the room
of the stranger woman. The King caused search to be made for her, and
she was not to be found. ""I will break the door,"" said the King, ""as I
can't get the key."" The King broke the door, and I went in, and went to
the trunk, and the King asked for a key to unlock it. He got no key, and
he broke the lock. When he opened the trunk the child and the hand were
stretched side by side, and the child was asleep. The King took the
hand, and ordered a woman to come for the child, and he showed the hand
to everyone in the house. But the stranger woman was gone, and she did
not see the King; and here she is herself to say if I am telling lies of
her."
morraha,11,"""Oh, it's nothing but the truth you have.""

The King did not allow me to be tied any more. He said there was nothing
so much to wonder at as that I cut the hand off, and I tied.

The child was growing till he was a year old, and he was beginning to
walk, and there was no one caring for him more than I was. He was
growing till he was three, and he was running out every minute. So the
King ordered a silver chain to be put between me and the child, so that
he might not go away from me. I was out with him in the garden every
day, and the King was as proud as the world of the child. He would be
watching him every place we went, till the child grew so wise that he
would loose the chain and get off. But one day that he loosed it I
failed to find him. I ran into the house and searched the house, but
there was no getting him for me. The King cried to go out and find the
child, that he had got loose from the dog. They went searching for him,
but they could not find him. When they failed altogether to find him,
there remained no more favour with the King towards me, and everyone
disliked me, and I grew weak, for I did not get a morsel to eat half the
time. When summer came I said I would try and go home to my own country.
I went away one fine morning, and I went swimming, and God helped me
till I came home. I went into the garden, for I knew there was a place
in the garden where I could hide myself, for fear she should see me. In
the morning I saw my wife out walking, and my child with her, held by
the hand. I pushed out to see the child, and, as he was looking about
him everywhere, he saw me, and called out, ""I see my shaggy papa. Oh,""
said he; ""oh, my heart's love, my shaggy papa, come here till I see
you."""
morraha,12,"I was afraid the woman would see me, as she was asking the child where
he saw me, and he said I was up in a tree. The more the child called
me, the more I hid myself. The woman took the child home with her, but I
knew he would be up early in the morning.

I went to the parlour window, and the child was within, and he playing.
When he saw me, he cried out, ""Oh, my heart's love, come here till I see
you, shaggy papa."" I broke the window, and went in, and he began to kiss
me. I saw the rod in front of the chimney, and I jumped up at the rod
and knocked it down. ""Oh, my heart's love, no one would give me the
pretty rod."" I thought he would strike me with the rod, but he did not.
When I saw the time was short, I raised my paw, and I gave him a scratch
below the knee. ""Oh, you naughty, dirty, shaggy papa! You have hurt me
so much--I'll give yourself a blow of the rod."" He struck me a light
blow, and as there was no sin on him, I came back to my own shape again.
When he saw a man standing before him he gave a cry, and I took him up
in my arms. The servants heard the child. A maid came in to see what was
the matter with him. When she saw me she gave a cry out of her, and she
said, ""Oh, my soul to God, if the master isn't come to life again.""

Another came in, and said it was he, really. And when the mistress heard
of it, she came to see with her own eyes, for she would not believe I
was there. When she saw me she said she'd drown herself. And I said
to her, ""If you yourself will keep the secret, no living man will ever
get the story from me until I lose my head.""

Many's the man has come asking for the story, and I never let one
return; but now everyone will know it, but she is as much to blame as I.
I gave you my head on the spot, and a thousand welcomes, and she cannot
say I have been telling anything but the truth."
morraha,13,"""Oh, surely, nor are you now.""

When I saw I was in a man's shape I said I would take the child back to
his father and mother, as I knew the grief they were in after him. I
got a ship, and took the child with me. When I was journeying I came
to land on an island, and I saw not a living soul on it, only a court,
dark and gloomy. I went in to see was there anyone in it. There was no
one but an old hag, tall and frightful, and she asked me, ""What sort of
person are you?"" I heard someone groaning in another room, and I said I
was a doctor, and I asked her what ailed the person who was groaning.

""Oh,"" said she, ""it is my son, whose hand has been bitten from his wrist
by a dog.""

I knew then it was the boy who was taking the child from me, and I said
I would cure him if I got a good reward.

""I have nothing, but there are eight young lads and three young women,
as handsome as anyone laid eyes on, and if you cure him I will give you
them.""

""But tell me in what place his hand was cut from.""

""Oh, it was out in another country twelve years ago.""

""Show me the way, that I may see him.""

She brought me into a room, so that I saw him, and his arm was swelled
up to the shoulder. He asked if I would cure him. I said I could
cure him if he would give me the reward his mother promised.

""Oh, I will give it, but cure me.""

""Well, bring them out to me."""
morraha,14,"The hag brought them out of the room. I said I would burn the flesh that
was on his arm. When I looked on him he was howling with pain. I said
that I would not leave him in pain long. The thief had only one eye in
his forehead. I took a bar of iron, and put it in the fire till it was
red, and I said to the hag, ""He will be howling at first, but will fall
asleep presently, and do not wake him until he has slept as much as he
wants. I will close the door when I am going out."" I took the bar with
me, and I stood over him, and I turned it across through his eye as far
as I could. He began to bellow, and tried to catch me, but I was out and
away, having closed the door. The hag asked me, ""Why is he bellowing?""

""Oh, he will be quiet presently, and will sleep for a good while, and
I'll come again to have a look at him. Bring me out the young men
and the young women.""

I took them with me, and I said to her, ""Tell me where you got them.""

""Oh, my son brought them with him, and they are the offspring of the one
King.""

I was well satisfied, and I had no liking for delay to get myself free
from the hag, and I took them on board the ship, and the child I had
myself. I thought the King might leave me the child I nursed myself. But
when I came to land, and all those young people with me, the King and
Queen were out walking. The King was very aged, and the Queen aged
likewise. When I came to converse with them, and the twelve with me, the
King and Queen began to cry. I asked, ""Why are you crying?"""
morraha,15,"""Oh, it is for good cause I am crying. As many children as these I
should have, and now I am withered, grey, at the end of my life, and I
have not one at all.""

""Oh, belike, you will yet have plenty.""

I told him all I went through, and I gave him the child in his hand,
and: ""These are your other children who were stolen from you, whom I am
giving to you safe. They are gently reared.""

When the King heard who they were, he smothered them with kisses and
drowned them with tears, and dried them with fine cloths, silken, and
the hairs of his own head, and so also did their mother, and great was
his welcome for me, as it was I who found them all. And the King said to
me, ""I will give you your own child, as it is you who have earned him
best; but you must come to my court every year, and the child with you,
and I will share with you my possessions.""

""Oh, I have enough of my own, and after my death I will leave it to the
child.""

I spent a time till my visit was over, and I told the King all the
troubles I went through, only I said nothing about my wife. And now you
have the story of the death of Anshgayliacht, the hag's son.

And Morraha thanked Rough Niall for the story, and he struck the ground
with the Sword of Light, and Brown Allree was beside of him and she said
to him, ""Sit up, now, riding, and take good heed of yourself,"" and at
one leap she cleared the sea and at the next the three miles of hill
covered with steel thistles and at the third the three miles of fire,
and then he was home and he told the tale of the death of Anshgayliacht
to the Slender Red Champion and gave him the Sword of Light, and he was
well pleased to get them, and he took the spells of Morraha, and he had
his wife and his castle back again, and by-and-by the five children; but
he never put his hand to card-playing with strangers again."
mother-hulda,1,"A WIDOW had two daughters; one was pretty and industrious, the other was ugly and lazy. And as the ugly one was her own daughter, she loved her much the best, and the pretty one was made to do all the work, and be the drudge of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled. Now it happened once that as the spindle was bloody, she dipped it into the well to wash it; but it slipped out of her hand and fell in. Then she began to cry, and ran to her step-mother, and told her of her misfortune; and her step-mother scolded her without mercy, and said in her rage, 
""As you have let the spindle fall in, you must go and fetch it out again!"""
mother-hulda,2,"Then the girl went back again to the well, not knowing what to do, and in the despair of her heart she jumped down into the well the same way the spindle had gone. After that she knew nothing; and when she came to herself she was in a beautiful meadow, and the sun was shining on the flowers that grew round her. And she walked on through the meadow until she came to a baker's oven that was full of bread; and the bread called out to her, 
""Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am baked enough already!"" 
Then she drew near, and with the baker's peel she took out all the loaves one after the other. And she went farther on till she came to a tree weighed down with apples, and it called out to her, 
""Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!"""
mother-hulda,3,"Then she shook the tree until the apples fell like rain, and she shook until there were no more to fall; and when she had gathered them together in a heap, she went on farther. At last she came to a little house, and an old woman was peeping out of it, but she had such great teeth that the girl was terrified and about to run away, only the old woman called her back. 
""What are you afraid of, my dear child? Come and live with me, and if you do the house-work well and orderly, things shall go well with you. You must take great pains to make my bed well, and shake it up thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about, and then in the world it snows, for I am Mother Hulda."""
mother-hulda,4,"As the old woman spoke so kindly, the girl took courage, consented, and went to her work. She did everything to the old woman's satisfaction, and shook the bed with such a will that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes: and so she led a good life, had never a cross word, but boiled and roast meat every day. When she had lived a long time with Mother Hulda, she began to feel sad, not knowing herself what ailed her; at last she began to think she must be home-sick; and although she was a thousand times better off than at home where she was, yet she had a great longing to go home. At last she said to her mistress, 
""I am home-sick, and although I am very well off here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go back to my own home."" 
Mother Hulda answered, 
""It pleases me well that you should wish to go home, and, as you have served me faithfully, I will undertake to send you there!"""
mother-hulda,5,"She took her by the hand and led her to a large door standing open, and as she was passing through it there fell upon her a heavy shower of gold, and the gold hung all about her, so that she was covered with it. 
""All this is yours, because you have been so industrious,"" said Mother Hulda; and, besides that, she returned to her her spindle, the very same that she had dropped in the well. And then the door was shut again, and the girl found herself back again in the world, not far from her mother's house; and as she passed through the yard the cock stood on the top of the well and cried, 
    ""Cock-a-doodle doo!     Our golden girl has come home too!"" 
Then she went in to her mother, and as she had returned covered with gold she was well received."
mother-hulda,6,"So the girl related all her history, and what had happened to her, and when the mother heard how she came to have such great riches she began to wish that her ugly and idle daughter might have the same good fortune. So she sent her to sit by the well and spin; and in order to make her spindle bloody she put her hand into the thorn hedge. Then she threw the spindle into the well, and jumped in herself. She found herself, like her sister, in the beautiful meadow, and followed the same path, and when she came to the baker's oven, the bread cried out, 
""Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am quite done already!"" 
But the lazy-bones answered, 
""I have no desire to black my hands,"" and went on farther. Soon she came to the apple-tree, who called out, 
""Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!"""
mother-hulda,7,"But she answered, 
""That is all very fine; suppose one of you should fall on my head,"" and went on farther. When she came to Mother Hulda's house she did not feel afraid, as she knew beforehand of her great teeth, and entered into her service at once. The first day she put her hand well to the work, and was industrious, and did everything Mother Hulda bade her, because of the gold she expected; but the second day she began to be idle, and the third day still more so, so that she would not get up in the morning. Neither did she make Mother Hulda's bed as it ought to have been made, and did not shake it for the feathers to fly about. So that Mother Hulda soon grew tired of her, and gave her warning, at which the lazy thing was well pleased, and thought that now the shower of gold was coming; so Mother Hulda led her to the door, and as she stood in the doorway, instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her."
mother-hulda,8,"""That is the reward for your service,"" said Mother Hulda, and shut the door. So the lazy girl came home all covered with pitch, and the cock on the top of the well seeing her, cried, 
    ""Cock-a-doodle doo!     Our dirty girl has come home too!"" 
And the pitch remained sticking to her fast, and never, as long as she lived, could it be got off."
moti,1,"Once upon a time there was a youth called Moti, who was very big and
strong, but the clumsiest creature you can imagine. So clumsy was he
that he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk
or curds which his mother set out on the floor to cool, always smashing,
upsetting, breaking, until at last his father said to him:

'Here, Moti, are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years;
take them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can.'

Then Moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over
his shoulder, singing gaily to himself as he walked along.

In one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when
he came to a certain city where he entered the travellers' 'serai' or
inn to pass the night. Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a
large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the
inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps
a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too
proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses. Moti, of
course, was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and
he wasn't rich and he wasn't proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the
innkeeper, set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home,
and in five minutes was fast asleep."
moti,2,"In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed,
and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag
of money had been stolen. He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around
to see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to
arouse a few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the
shadow of the archways round the whole serai without coming across a
likely thief. He was just about to give it up when he overheard two men
whispering, and one laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw
two Afghan horsedealers counting out his bag of money! Then Moti went
back to bed!

In the morning Moti followed the two Afghans outside the city to the
horsemarket in which they horses were offered for sale. Choosing the
best-looking horse amongst them he went up to it and said:

'Is this horse for sale? may I try it?' and, the merchants assenting, he
scrambled up on its back, dug in his heels, and off they flew. Now Moti
had never been on a horse in his life, and had so much ado to hold on
with both hands as well as with both legs that the animal went just
where it liked, and very soon broke into a break-neck gallop and made
straight back to the serai where it had spent the last few nights."
moti,3,"'This will do very well,' thought Moti as they whirled in at the
entrance. As soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of
its own accord and Moti immediately rolled off; but he jumped up at
once, tied the beast up, and called for some breakfast. Presently the
Afghans appeared, out of breath and furious, and claimed the horse.

'What do you mean?' cried Moti, with his mouth full of rice, 'it's my
horse; I paid you fifty pieces of silver for it--quite a bargain, I'm
sure!'

'Nonsense! it is our horse,' answered one of the Afghans beginning to
untie the bridle.

'Leave off,' shouted Moti, seizing his staff; 'if you don't let my horse
alone I'll crack your skulls! you thieves! I know you! Last night you
took my money, so to-day I took your horse; that's fair enough!'"
moti,4,"Now the Afghans began to look a little uncomfortable, but Moti seemed so
determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law, so
they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen
one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it.

Presently a soldier came to summon Moti to the king; and, when he
arrived and made his obeisance, the king began to question him as to why
he had galloped off with the horse in this fashion. But Moti declared
that he had got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver,
whilst the horse merchants vowed that the money they had on them was
what they had received for the sale of other horses; and in one way and
another the dispute got so confusing that the king (who really thought
that Moti had stolen the horse) said at last, 'Well, I tell you what
I will do. I will lock something into this box before me, and if he
guesses what it is, the horse is his, and if he doesn't then it is
yours.'

To this Moti agreed, and the king arose and went out alone by a
little door at the back of the Court, and presently came back clasping
something closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe, slipped it into
the little box, locked the box, and set it up where all might see."
moti,5,"'Now,' said the king to Moti, 'guess!'

It happened that when the king had opened the door behind him, Moti
noticed that there was a garden outside: without waiting for the king's
return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small
enough to be shut in the box. 'Is it likely to be a fruit or a flower?
No, not a flower this time, for he clasped it too tight. Then it must
be a fruit or a stone. Yet not a stone, because he wouldn't wrap a dirty
stone in his nice clean cloth. Then it is a fruit! And a fruit without
much scent, or else he would be afraid that I might smell it. Now what
fruit without much scent is in season just now? When I know that I shall
have guessed the riddle!'

As has been said before, Moti was a country lad, and was accustomed
to work in his father's garden. He knew all the common fruits, so he
thought he ought to be able to guess right; but so as not to let it
seem too easy, he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression, and
looked down at the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed
against his forehead, and then he said, slowly, with his eyes on the
king,--

'It is freshly plucked! It is round and it is red! It is a pomegranate!'"
moti,6,"Now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to
eat; and, as for seasons, he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever
he wanted it, and saw that he got it; so to him Moti's guess was like
a miracle, and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence,
for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box. Of course when
the king marvelled and praised Moti's wisdom, everybody else did so too;
and, whilst the Afghans went off crestfallen, Moti took the horse and
entered the king's service.

Very soon after this, Moti, who continued to live in the serai, came
back one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had
strayed. Nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord, and no one
knew what had become of him. After inquiring of everyone who was likely
to know, Moti seized the cord and his big staff and sallied out to
look for him. Away and away he tramped out of the city and into the
neighbouring forest, tracking hoof-marks in the mud. Presently it
grew late, but still Moti wandered on until suddenly in the gathering
darkness he came right upon a tiger who was contentedly eating his
horse."
moti,7,"'You thief!' shrieked Moti, and ran up and, just as the tiger, in
astonishment, dropped a bone--whack! came Moti's staff on his head with
such good will that the beast was half stunned and could hardly breathe
or see. Then Moti continued to shower upon him blows and abuse until the
poor tiger could hardly stand, whereupon his tormentor tied the end of
the broken halter round his neck and dragged him back to the serai.

'If you had my horse,' he said, 'I will at least have you, that's fair
enough!' And he tied him up securely by the head and heels, much as he
used to tie the horse; then, the night being far gone, he flung himself
beside him and slept soundly.

You cannot imagine anything like the fright of the people in the
serai, when they woke up and found a tiger--very battered but still
a tiger--securely tethered amongst themselves and their beasts! Men
gathered in groups talking and exclaiming, and finding fault with the
innkeeper for allowing such a dangerous beast into the serai, and all
the while the innkeeper was just as troubled as the rest, and none dared
go near the place where the tiger stood blinking miserably on everyone,
and where Moti lay stretched out snoring like thunder."
moti,8,"At last news reached the king that Moti had exchanged his horse for a
live tiger; and the monarch himself came down, half disbelieving the
tale, to see if it were really true. Someone at last awaked Moti with
the news that his royal master was come; and he arose yawning, and was
soon delightedly explaining and showing off his new possession. The
king, however, did not share his pleasure at all, but called up a
soldier to shoot the tiger, much to the relief of all the inmates of the
serai except Moti. If the king, however, was before convinced that Moti
was one of the wisest of men, he was now still more convinced that he
was the bravest, and he increased his pay a hundredfold, so that our
hero thought that he was the luckiest of men.

A week or two after this incident the king sent for Moti, who on arrival
found his master in despair. A neighbouring monarch, he explained, who
had many more soldiers than he, had declared war against him, and he was
at his wits' end, for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers
enough to fight him--what was he to do?

'If that is all, don't you trouble,' said Moti. 'Turn out your men, and
I'll go with them, and we'll soon bring this robber to reason.'"
moti,9,"The king began to revive at these hopeful words, and took Moti off to
his stable where he bade him choose for himself any horse he liked.
There were plenty of fine horses in the stalls, but to the king's
astonishment Moti chose a poor little rat of a pony that was used to
carry grass and water for the rest of the stable.

'But why do you choose that beast?' said the king.

'Well, you see, your majesty,' replied Moti, 'there are so many chances
that I may fall off, and if I choose one of your fine big horses I shall
have so far to fall that I shall probably break my leg or my arm, if not
my neck, but if I fall off this little beast I can't hurt myself much.'

A very comical sight was Moti when he rode out to the war. The only
weapon he carried was his staff, and to help him to keep his balance
on horseback he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly
touched the ground as he sat astride the little pony. The rest of the
king's cavalry were not very numerous, but they pranced along in armour
on fine horses. Behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed
with all sorts of weapons, and last of all was the king with his
attendants, very nervous and ill at ease. So the army started."
moti,10,"They had not very far to go, but Moti's little pony, weighted with a
heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry,
and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very
anxious to be too early in the fight, and hung back so as to give Moti
plenty of time. The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some
time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony,
he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony
completely lost his temper and bolted. First one stone became untied
and rolled away in a cloud of dust to one side of the road, whilst Moti
nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged
mane, and, dropping his staff, held on for dear life. Then, fortunately
the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously
down a neighbouring ravine. Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely
time to draw to one side when Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty
threats to his pony:

'You wait till I get hold of you! I'll skin you alive! I'll wring your
neck! I'll break every bone in your body!' The cavalry thought that
this dreadful language was meant for the enemy, and were filled with
admiration of his courage. Many of their horses too were quite upset by
this whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst, and in a few
minutes, after a little plunging and rearing and kicking, the whole
troop were following on Moti's heels."
moti,11,"Far in advance, Moti continued his wild career. Presently in his course
he came to a great field of castor-oil plants, ten or twelve feet high,
big and bushy, but quite green and soft. Hoping to escape from the back
of his fiery steed Moti grasped one in passing, but its roots gave
way, and he dashed on, with the whole plant looking like a young tree
flourishing in his grip.

The enemy were in battle array, advancing over the plain, their king
with them confident and cheerful, when suddenly from the front came a
desperate rider at a furious gallop.

'Sire!' he cried, 'save yourself! the enemy are coming!'

'What do you mean?' said the king.

'Oh, sire!' panted the messenger, 'fly at once, there is no time to
lose. Foremost of the enemy rides a mad giant at a furious gallop. He
flourishes a tree for a club and is wild with anger, for as he goes he
cries, ""You wait till I get hold of you! I'll skin you alive! I'll wring
your neck! I'll break every bone in your body!"" Others ride behind, and
you will do well to retire before this whirlwind of destruction comes
upon you.'"
moti,12,"Just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw Moti
approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with
the little beast he rode, whirling his castor-oil plant, which in the
distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and
shoutings came down upon the breeze! Behind him the dust cloud moved
to the sound of the thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the
glitter of steel. The sight and the sound struck terror into the king,
and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment
of yelling giants was upon him; and all his force followed him as fast
as they might go. One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with
that mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the
ground in abject fear. This was too much for Moti's excited pony, who
shied so suddenly that Moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket,
and alighted right on the top of his fat foe.

Quickly regaining his feet Moti began to swing his plant round his head
and to shout:

'Where are your men? Bring them up and I'll kill them. My regiments!
Come on, the whole lot of you! Where's your king? Bring him to me. Here
are all my fine fellows coming up and we'll each pull up a tree by the
roots and lay you all flat and your houses and towns and everything
else! Come on!'"
moti,13,"But the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with
his hands together, gasping. At last, when he got his breath, Moti sent
him off to bring his king, and to tell him that if he was reasonable his
life should be spared. Off the poor man went, and by the time the troops
of Moti's side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable
as possible, he returned with his king. The latter was very humble and
apologetic, and promised never to make war any more, to pay a large sum
of money, and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished.

So the armies on both sides went rejoicing home, and this was really
the making of the fortune of clumsy Moti, who lived long and contrived
always to be looked up to as a fountain of wisdom, valour, and
discretion by all except his relations, who could never understand what
he had done to be considered so much wiser than anyone else."
mr-korbes,1,"A COCK and a hen once wanted to go a journey together. So the cock built
a beautiful carriage with four red wheels, and he harnessed four little
mice to it. And the cock and the hen got into it, and were driven off.
Very soon they met a cat, who asked where they were going. The cock
answered,

    ""On Mr. Korbes a call to pay,
    And that is where we go to-day!"""
mr-korbes,2,"""Take me with you,"" said the cat.
The cock answered,""Very well, only you must sit well back, and then you will not fall forward.""
    ""And pray take care
    Of my red wheels there;
    And wheels be steady,
    And mice be ready
    On Mr. Korbes a call to pay,
    For that is where we go to-day!"""
mr-korbes,3,"Then there came up a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin,
and lastly a needle, who all got up on the carriage, and were driven
along. But when they came to Mr. Korbes's house he was not at home. So
the mice drew the carriage into the barn, the cock and the hen flew up
and perched on a beam, the cat sat by the fireside, the duck settled on
the water; but the egg wrapped itself in the towel, the pin stuck itself
in the chair cushion, the needle jumped into the bed among the pillows,
and the millstone laid itself by the door."
mr-korbes,4,"Then Mr. Korbes came home,
and went to the hearth to make a fire, but the cat threw ashes in his
eyes. Then he ran quickly into the kitchen to wash himself, but the duck
splashed water in his face. Then he was going to wipe it with the towel,
but the egg broke in it, and stuck his eyelids together. In order to get
a little peace he sat down in his chair, but the pin ran into him, and,
starting up, in his vexation he threw himself on the bed, but as his
head fell on the pillow, in went the needle, so that he called out with
the pain, and madly rushed out. But when he reached the housedoor the
mill-stone jumped up and struck him dead. What a bad man Mr. Korbes must have been!"
murmur-goose-egg,1,"ONCE upon a time there were five women who were standing in a field, mowing. Heaven had not given a single one of them a child, and each of them wanted to have one. And suddenly they saw a goose-egg of quite unheard-of size, well-nigh as large as a man's head. ""I saw it first,"" said the one. ""I saw it at the same time that you did,"" insisted another. ""But I want it, for I saw it first of all,"" maintained a third. And thus they went on, and fought so about the egg that they nearly came to blows. Finally they agreed that it should belong to all five of them, and that all of them should sit on it, as a goose would do, and hatch out the little gosling. The first remained sitting on the egg for eight days, and hatched, and did not move or do a thing. During this time the rest had to feed her and themselves as well. One of them grew angry because of this and scolded."
murmur-goose-egg,2,"""You did not crawl out of the egg either before you could cry peep!"" said the one who was sitting on the egg and hatching. ""Yet I almost believe that a human child is going to slip out of the egg, for something is murmuring inside it without ever stopping: Herring and mush, porridge and milk,"" said she. ""And now you can sit on it for eight days, while we bring you food."""
murmur-goose-egg,3,"When the fifth day of the eight had passed, it was plain to her that there was a child in the egg, which kept on calling: ""Herring and mush, porridge and milk,"" and so she punched a hole in the egg. Instead of a gosling out came a child. It was quite disgustingly homely, with a big head and a small body. No sooner had it crawled out than it began to cry: ""Herring and mush, porridge and milk!"" So they named the child Murmur Goose-Egg."
murmur-goose-egg,4,"In spite of the child's homeliness, the women at first took a great deal of pleasure in him. But before long, he grew so greedy that he devoured everything they had. When they cooked a dish of mush or a potful of porridge that was to do for all six of them, the child swallowed it all by himself. So they did not want to keep him any longer. ""I have not had a single full meal since the changling crawled out,"" said one of them. When Murmur Goose-Egg heard that, and the rest agreed, he said that he would gladly go his own gait, for ""if they had no need of him, then he had no need of them,"" and with that he went off. Finally he came to a farmstead that lay in a rocky section, and asked for work. Yes, they needed a workman, and the master told him to gather up the stones in the field. Then Murmur Goose-Egg gathered up the stones in the field. He picked up some that were so large that a number of horses could not have dragged them, and large and small, one and all, he put them in his pocket. Before long he had finished his work, and wanted to know what he was to do next."
murmur-goose-egg,5,"""You have picked up the stones in the field?"" said his master. ""You cannot possibly have finished before you have really begun!""

But Murmur Goose-Egg emptied his pockets, and threw the stones on a pile. Then his master saw that he had finished his work, and that one would have to handle such a strong fellow with kid gloves. So he told him to come in and eat. That suited Murmur Goose-Egg, and he ate up everything that was to have supplied the master and his family, and the help, and then he was only half satisfied."
murmur-goose-egg,6,"He was really a splendid worker; but a dangerous eater, like a bottomless cask, said the peasant. ""Such a serving-man could eat up a poor peasant, house and ground, before he noticed it,"" said he. He had no more work for him, and the best thing to do would be to go to the king's castle.

So Murmur Goose-Egg went to the king, and was at once given a place, and there was enough to eat and drink in the castle. He was to be the errand-boy, and help the maids fetch wood and water, and do other odd jobs. So he asked what he was to do first."
murmur-goose-egg,7,"For the time being he could chop fire-wood, said they. So Murmur Goose-Egg began to chop fire-wood, and hewed to the line in such fashion that the chips fairly flew. Before long he had chopped up all that there was, kindling wood and building wood, beams and boards, and when he was through with it, he came and asked what he was to do now.

""You can finish chopping the fire-wood,"" said they.

""There is none left,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg."
murmur-goose-egg,8,"That could not be possible, said the superintendent, and looked into the wood-bin. Yes, indeed, Murmur Goose-Egg had chopped up everything, large and small, beams and boards. That was very bad. Therefore the superintendent said that Murmur Goose-Egg should have nothing to eat until he had chopped down just as much wood in the forest as he had just chopped up for fire-wood."
murmur-goose-egg,9,"Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy, and had the smith make an iron ax of five hundred-weights. With that he went into the forest and began to chop. He chopped down big pine and fir trees, as thick as masts, and all that he found on the king's ground, as well as what he found on that of his neighbors. But he cut off neither the branches nor the tree-tops, so that all lay there as though felled by the storm. Then he loaded a sizable stack on the sled, and put to the horses. But they could not move the load from the spot. So he unharnessed them, and put himself to the sled, and went off alone with the load. When he came to the king's castle, there stood the king with the master carpenter in the entrance, and they were ready to give him a warm reception, because of the destruction he had wrought in the forest. For the master carpenter had been there and seen the havoc he had made. But when Murmur Goose-Egg came along with half the forest, the king grew frightened as well as angry, and he thought that if Murmur was so strong, it would be best to handle him with care."
murmur-goose-egg,10,"""Why, you are a splendid workman,"" said the king, ""but tell me, how much do you really eat at once,"" he continued, ""for I am sure you are hungry?""

If he were to have enough porridge, they would have to take twelve tons of meal to make it. After he had eaten that, then he could wait a while, said Murmur Goose-Egg.

It took some time before so much porridge could be prepared, and in the meantime Murmur was to carry wood into the kitchen. So he piled the whole load of wood on a sled. When he drove it through the door, he did not go to work about it very gently. The house nearly broke from its joints, and he well-nigh tore down the entire castle. When at last dinner was ready, they sent him out into the field, to call the help. He called so loudly that hill and vale reechoed the sound. But still the people did not come quick enough to suit him. So he picked a quarrel with them, and killed twelve."
murmur-goose-egg,11,"""You kill twelve of my people, and you eat for twelve times twelve of them, but how many men's work can you do?"" asked the king.

""I do the work of twelve times twelve, too,"" said Murmur. When he had eaten, he was to go to the barn and thresh. So he pulled the beam out of the roof-tree, and made a flail out of it, and when the roof threatened to fall in, he took a pine-tree with all its boughs and branches, and set it up in place of the roof-beam. Then he threshed corn and hay and straw, all together, and it seemed as though a cloud hung over the royal castle."
murmur-goose-egg,12,"When Murmur Goose-Egg had nearly finished threshing, the enemy broke into the land, and war began. Then the king told him to gather people about him, and go to meet the foe, and do battle with him, for he thought the enemy would probably kill him.

No, said Murmur Goose-Egg, he did not want to have the king's people killed. He would see that he dealt with the enemy himself.

All the better, thought the king, then I am sure to get rid of him. But he would need a proper club, said Murmur."
murmur-goose-egg,13,"So they sent to the smith, and he forged a club of two hundred-weights. That would only do for a nut-cracker, said Murmur Goose-Egg. So he forged another that weighed six hundred-weights. That would do to hammer shoes with, said Murmur Goose-Egg. But the smith told him that he and all his workmen together could not forge a larger one.

Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy himself, and forged himself a club of thirty hundred-weights. It would have taken a hundred men just to turn it around on the anvil. This might do at a pinch, said Murmur. Then he wanted a knapsack with provisions. It was sewn together out of fifteen ox-skins, and stuffed full of provisions. Then Murmur wandered down the hill with the knapsack on his back, and the club over his shoulder."
murmur-goose-egg,14,"When he came near enough for the soldiers to see him, they sent to ask whether he had a mind to attack them.

""Just wait until I have eaten,"" said Murmur, and sat him down behind his knapsack to eat. But the enemy would not wait, and began to fire at him. And it fairly rained and hailed musket-balls all around Murmur.

""I don't care a fig for these blueberries,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg, and feasted on quite at ease. Neither lead nor iron could wound him, and his knapsack stood before him, and caught the bullets like a wall."
murmur-goose-egg,15,"Then the enemy began to throw bombs at him, and shoot at him with cannon. He hardly moved when he was struck. ""O, that's of no account!"" said he.

But then a bomb flew into his wind-pipe. ""Faugh!"" said he, and spat it out again, and then came a chain-bullet and fell into his butter-plate, and another tore away the bit of bread from between his fingers."
murmur-goose-egg,16,"Then he grew angry, stood up, took his club, pounded the ground with it, and asked whether they wanted to take the food from his mouth with the blueberries they were blowing out at him from their clumsy blow-pipes. Then he struck a few more blows, so that the hills and valleys round about trembled, and all the enemy flew up into the air like chaff, and that was the end of the war.

When Murmur came back and asked for more work, the king was at a loss, for he had felt sure that now he was rid of him. So he knew of nothing better to do than to send him to the devil's place."
murmur-goose-egg,17,"""Now you can go to the devil, and fetch the tribute from him,"" said the king. Murmur Goose-Egg went off with his knapsack on his back, and his club over his shoulder. He had soon reached the right spot. When he got there the devil was away at a trial. There was no one home but his grandmother, and she said she had never yet heard anything about a tribute, and that he was to come back some other time.

""Yes, indeed, come again to-morrow,"" said he. ""I know that old excuse!"" But since he was there, he would stay there, for he had to take home the tribute, and he had plenty of time to wait. But when he had eaten all his provisions, he grew weary. He again demanded the tribute from the grandmother."
murmur-goose-egg,18,"""You will get nothing from me, and that's as flat as the old fir-tree outside is fast,"" said the devil's grandmother. The fir-tree stood in front of the gate to the devil's place, and was so large that fifteen men could hardly girdle it with their arms. But Murmur climbed up into its top and bent and shook it to and fro as though it were a willow wand. Then asked the devil's grandmother once more whether she would now pay him the tribute."
murmur-goose-egg,19,"So she did not dare to refuse any longer, and brought out as much money as he could possibly carry in his knapsack. Then he set out for home with the tribute. Now no sooner had he gone than the devil came home, and when he learned that Murmur had taken along a big bag of money. He first beat his grandmother, and then hurried after Murmur. And he soon caught up to him, for he ran over sticks and stones, and sometimes flew in between; while Murmur had to stick to the highway with his heavy knapsack. But with the devil at his heels, he began to run as fast as he could. He stretched out the club behind him, to keep the devil from coming to close quarters. And thus they ran along, one behind the other. Murmur held the shaft and the devil the end of the club, until they reached a deep valley. There Murmur jumped from one mountain-top to another, and the devil followed him so hotly that he ran into the club, fell down into the valley and broke his foot-and there he lay."
murmur-goose-egg,20,"""There's your tribute!"" said Murmur Goose-Egg, when he had reached the royal castle, and he flung down the knapsack full of money before the king, so that the whole castle tottered. The king thanked him kindly, and promised him a good reward, and a good character, if he wanted it; but Murmur only wanted more work to do.

""What shall I do now?"" he asked. The king reflected for a while, and then he said Murmur should travel to the hill-troll, who had robbed him of the sword of his ancestors. He lived in a castle by the sea, where no one ventured to go."
murmur-goose-egg,21,"Murmur was given a few cart-loads of provisions in his big knapsack, and once more set out. Long he wandered, though, over field and wood, over hills and deep valleys, till he came to a great mountain where the troll lived who had robbed the king of the sword.

But the troll was not out in the open, and the mountain was closed, so Murmur could not get it. So he joined a party of stone-breakers, who were working at a mountainside, and worked along with them. They had never had such a helper, for Murmur hewed away at the rocks till they burst, and stone bowlders as large as houses came rolling down. But when he was about to rest and eat up the first cart-load of his provisions, it had already been eaten up. ""I have a good appetite myself,"" said Murmur, ""but whoever got hold of it has an even better one, for he has eaten up the bones as well!"""
murmur-goose-egg,22,"Thus it went the first day, and the second was no better. On the third day he went to work again, and took along the third cart-load, lay down behind it, and pretended to be sleeping.

Then a troll with seven heads came out of the hill, began to smack his lips, and eat of his provisions.

""Now the table is set, so now I am going to eat,"" said he.

""First we'll see about that,"" said Murmur, and hewed away at the troll so that the heads flew from his body."
murmur-goose-egg,23,"Then he went into the hill out of which the troll had come, and inside stood a horse eating out of a barrel of glowing ashes, while behind him stood a barrel filled with oats.

""Why don't you eat out of the barrel of oats?"" asked Murmur Goose-Egg.

""Because I cannot turn around,"" said the horse.

""I will turn you around,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg.

""Tear my head off instead,"" pleaded the horse."
murmur-goose-egg,24,"Murmur did so, and then the horse turned into a fine-looking man. He said that he had been enchanted, and turned into a horse by the troll. Then he helped Murmur look for the sword, which the troll had hidden under the bed. But in the bed lay the troll's grandmother, and she was snoring.

They went home by water, and just as they sailed off the old troll grandmother came after them; but she could not get at them, hence she commenced to drink, so that the water went down and grew lower. But at last she could not drink up the whole sea, and so she burst."
murmur-goose-egg,25,"When they came ashore, Murmur sent to the king, and had him told to have the sword fetched; but though the king sent four horses, they could not move it from the spot. He sent eight, he sent twelve, but the sword remained where it was, and could not be moved from the spot by any means. Then Murmur Goose-Egg took it up, and carried it alone.

The king could not believe his eyes when he saw Murmur once more; but he was very friendly and promised him gold and green forests. But when Murmur asked for more work, he told him to travel to his troll's castle, where no one dared go, and to remain there until he had built a bridge across the sound, so that people could cross. If he could do that, he would reward him well, yes, he would even give him his daughter, said the king. He would attend to it, said Murmur."
murmur-goose-egg,26,"Yet no human being had ever returned thence alive; all who had gotten so far, lay on the ground dead, and crushed to a jelly, and the king thought, when sending him there, that he would never see him again.

But Murmur set out. He took with him his knapsack full of provisions, and a properly turned and twisted block of pine-wood, as well as an ax, a wedge and some wooden chips."
murmur-goose-egg,27,"When he reached the sound, the river was full of drifting ice, and it roared like a waterfall. But he planted his legs firmly on the ground, and waded along until he got across. When he had warmed himself and satisfied his hunger, he wanted to sleep; but a tumult and rumbling started, as though the whole castle were to be turned upside down. The gate flew wide open, and Murmur saw nothing but a pair of yawning jaws that reached from the threshold to the top of the door."
murmur-goose-egg,28,"""Let's see who you may be? Perhaps you are an old friend of mine,"" said Murmur. And sure enough, it was Master Devil. Then they played cards together. The devil would gladly have won back some of the tribute Murmur had forced from his grandmother for the king. Yet, no matter how he played, Murmur always won; for he made a cross on the cards. And after he had won all the devil had with him, the latter had to give him some of the gold and silver that was in the castle.

In the midst of their game the fire went out, so that they could no longer tell the cards apart.

""Now we must split wood,"" said Murmur. He hewed into the block of pine-wood with his ax, and drove in the wedge, but the tree-stump was tough, and would not split at once, though Murmur gave himself all manner of pains.

""You are supposed to be strong,"" he said to the devil. ""Spit on your hands, slap in your claws here, and pull the block apart, so that I can see what you can do!"""
murmur-goose-egg,29,"The devil obediently thrust both hands into the split, and tore and clawed with all his might; but suddenly Murmur Goose-Egg knocked out the wedge, and there the devil was caught in a vice, while Murmur belabored his back with the ax. The devil wailed, and begged Murmur to let him go; but Murmur would hear nothing of it until he had promised never to come back and make a nuisance of himself again. Besides that, he had to promise to build a bridge over the sound, on which one could go back and forth at all seasons of the year. And the bridge was to be completed immediately after the breaking up of the ice-drift.

""Alas!"" said the devil, but there was nothing for it but to promise if he wished to go free. Yet he made one condition, that he was to have the first soul that crossed the bridge as sound-toll.

He could have it, said Murmur. Then he let the devil out, and he ran straight home. But Murmur lay down and slept until far into the following day."
murmur-goose-egg,30,"Then the king came to see whether Murmur Goose-Egg were lying crushed on the ground, or had merely been badly beaten. He had to wade through piles of money before he could reach the bed. The money was stacked up high along the walls in heaps and in bags, and Murmur lay in the bed and snored.

""May heaven help me and my daughter!"" cried the king, when he saw that Murmur Goose-Egg was in the best of health. Yes, and no one could deny that everything had been well and thoroughly done, said the king. There could be no talk of marriage as long as the bridge had not been built.

Then one day the bridge was finished; and on it stood the devil, ready to collect the toll promised him."
murmur-goose-egg,31,"Murmur Goose-Egg wanted the king to be the first to try the bridge with him. The king had no mind to do so, therefore Murmur himself mounted a horse, and swung up the fat dairy-maid from the castle before him on the saddle-bow-she looked almost like a gigantic block of wood-and dashed across the bridge with her so that the planks fairly thundered.

""Where is my sound-toll? Where is the soul?"" cried the devil. ""Sitting in this block of wood! If you want her, you must spit on your hands and catch hold of her,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg. ""No, thank you! If she does not catch hold of me, then I'll certainly not catch hold of her,"" said the devil. ""You caught me in a vice once, but you can't fool me a second time,"" said he, and flew straight home to his grandmother, and since then nothing more has been heard or seen of him."
murmur-goose-egg,32,"But Murmur Goose-Egg hurried back to the castle and asked for the reward the king had promised him. And when the king hesitated and began to make all sorts of excuses, in order not to have to keep his promise. Murmur said it would be best to have a substantial knapsackful of provisions made ready, since now he, Murmur, was going to take his reward himself. This the king did, and when the knapsack was ready, Murmur took the king along with him in front of the castle, and gave him a proper shove, so that he flew high up into the air. And he threw the knapsack up after him, so that he would not be left altogether without provisions. If he has not come down yet, then he, together with the knapsack, is floating between heaven and earth to this very day."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,1,"In the days when Murtough Mac Erca was in the High Kingship of Ireland,
the country was divided between the old beliefs of paganism and the new
doctrines of the Christian teaching. Part held with the old creed and
part with the new, and the thought of the people was troubled between
them, for they knew not which way to follow and which to forsake. The
faith of their forefathers clung close around them, holding them by many
fine and tender threads of memory and custom and tradition; yet still
the new faith was making its way, and every day it spread wider and
wider through the land.

The family of Murtough had joined itself to the Christian faith, and his
three brothers were bishops and abbots of the Church, but Murtough
himself remained a pagan, for he was a wild and lawless prince, and the
peaceful teachings of the Christian doctrine, with its forgiveness of
enemies, pleased him not at all. Fierce and cruel was his life, filled
with dark deeds and bloody wars, and savage and tragic was his death, as
we shall hear.

Now Murtough was in the sunny summer palace of Cletty, which Cormac, son
of Art, had built for a pleasure house on the brink of the slow-flowing
Boyne, near the Fairy Brugh of Angus the Ever Young, the God of Youth
and Beauty. A day of summer was that day, and the King came forth to
hunt on the borders of the Brugh, with all his boon companions around
him. But when the high-noon came the sun grew hot, and the King sat down
to rest upon the fairy mound, and the hunt passed on beyond him, and he
was left alone."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,2,"There was a witch woman in that country whose name was ""Sigh, Sough,
Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, and Groan."" Star-bright and
beautiful was she in face and form, but inwardly she was cruel as her
names. And she hated Murtough because he had scattered and destroyed the
Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin, her country and her
fatherland, and because in the battle which he fought at Cerb on the
Boyne her father and her mother and her sister had been slain. For in
those days women went to battle side by side with men.

She knew, too, that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come
upon the fairy folk, and their power and their great majesty would
depart from them, and men would call them demons, and would drive them
out with psalm-singing and with the saying of prayers, and with the
sound of little tinkling bells."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,3,"So trouble and anger wrought in the
witch woman, and she waited the day to be revenged on Murtough, for he
being yet a pagan, was still within her power to harm.

So when Sheen (for Sheen or ""Storm"" was the name men gave to her) saw
the King seated on the fairy mound and all his comrades parted from him,
she arose softly, and combed her hair with her comb of silver adorned
with little ribs of gold, and she washed her hands in a silver basin
wherein were four golden birds sitting on the rim of the bowl, and
little bright gems of carbuncle set round about the rim. And she donned
her fairy mantle of flowing green, and her cloak, wide and hooded, with
silvery fringes, and a brooch of fairest gold. On her head were tresses
yellow like to gold, plaited in four locks, with a golden drop at the
end of each long tress."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,4,"The hue of her hair was like the flower of the
iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof. And she
wore on her breasts and at her shoulders marvellous clasps of gold,
finely worked with the tracery of the skilled craftsman, and a golden
twisted torque around her throat. And when she was decked she went
softly and sat down beside Murtough on the turfy hunting mound. And
after a space Murtough perceived her sitting there, and the sun shining
upon her, so that the glittering of the gold and of her golden hair and
the bright shining of the green silk of her garments, was like the
yellow iris-beds upon the lake on a sunny summer's day. Wonder and
terror seized on Murtough at her beauty, and he knew not if he loved
her or if he hated her the most; for at one moment all his nature was
filled with longing and with love of her, so that it seemed to him that
he would give the whole of Ireland for the loan of one hour's space of
dalliance with her; but after that he felt a dread of her, because he
knew his fate was in her hands, and that she had come to work him ill."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,5,"But he welcomed her as if she were known to him and he asked her
wherefore she was come. ""I am come,"" she said, ""because I am beloved of
Murtough, son of Erc, King of Erin, and I come to seek him here."" Then
Murtough was glad, and he said, ""Dost thou not know me, maiden?"" ""I do,""
she answered, ""for all secret and mysterious things are known to me and
thou and all the men of Erin are well known.""

After he had conversed with her awhile, she appeared to him so fair that
the King was ready to promise her anything in life she wished, so long
as she would go with him to Cletty of the Boyne. ""My wish,"" she said,
""is that you take me to your house, and that you put out from it your
wife and your children because they are of the new faith, and all the
clerics that are in your house, and that neither your wife nor any
cleric be permitted to enter the house while I am there."""
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,6,"""I will give you,"" said the King, ""a hundred head of every herd of
cattle that is within my kingdom, and a hundred drinking horns, and a
hundred cups, and a hundred rings of gold, and a feast every other night
in the summer palace of Cletty. But I pledge thee my word, oh, maiden,
it were easier for me to give thee half of Ireland than to do this
thing that thou hast asked."" For Murtough feared that when those that
were of the Christian faith were put out of his house, she would work
her spells upon him, and no power would be left with him to resist those
spells.

""I will not take thy gifts,"" said the damsel, ""but only those things
that I have asked; moreover, it is thus, that my name must never be
uttered by thee, nor must any man or woman learn it.""

""What is thy name,"" said Murtough, ""that it may not come upon my lips to
utter it?""

And she said, ""Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail,
Groan, this is my name, but men call me Sheen, for 'Storm' or Sheen is
my chief name, and storms are with me where I come.""

Nevertheless, Murtough was so fascinated by her that he brought her to
his home, and drove out the clerics that were there, with his wife and
children along with them, and drove out also the nobles of his own clan,
the children of Niall, two great and gallant battalions. And Duivsech,
his wife, went crying along the road with her children around her to
seek Bishop Cairnech, the half-brother of her husband, and her own
soul-friend, that she might obtain help and shelter from him."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,7,"But Sheen went gladly and light-heartedly into the House of Cletty, and
when she saw the lovely lightsome house and the goodly nobles of the
clan of Niall, and the feasting and banqueting and the playing of the
minstrels and all the joyous noise of that kingly dwelling, her heart
was lifted within her, and ""Fair as a fairy palace is this house of
Cletty,"" said she.

""Fair, indeed, it is,"" replied the King; ""for neither the Kings of
Leinster nor the Kings of mighty Ulster, nor the lords of the clans of
Owen or of Niall, have such a house as this; nay, in Tara of the Kings
itself, no house to equal this house of mine is found."" And that night
the King robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity, and on
his right hand he seated Sheen, and a great banquet was made before
them, and men said that never on earth was to be seen a woman more
goodly of appearance than she."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,8,"And the King was astonished at her, and
he began to ask her questions, for it seemed to him that the power of a
great goddess of the ancient time was in her; and he asked her whence
she came, and what manner was the power that he saw in her. He asked
her, too, did she believe in the God of the clerics, or was she herself
some goddess of the older world? For he feared her, feeling that his
fate was in her hands.

She laughed a careless and a cruel laugh, for she knew that the King was
in their power, now that she was there alone with him, and the clerics
and the Christian teachers gone. ""Fear me not, O Murtough,"" she cried;
""I am, like thee, a daughter of the race of men of the ancient family of
Adam and of Eve; fit and meet my comradeship with thee; therefore, fear
not nor regret."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,9,"And as to that true God of thine, worker of miracles and
helper of His people, no miracle in all the world is there that I, by
mine own unaided power, cannot work the like. I can create a sun and
moon; the heavens I can sprinkle with radiant stars of night. I can call
up to life men fiercely fighting in conflict, slaughtering one another.
Wine I could make of the cold water of the Boyne, and sheep of lifeless
stones, and swine of ferns. In the presence of the hosts I can make
gold and silver, plenty and to spare; and hosts of famous fighting men I
can produce from naught. Now, tell me, can thy God work the like?""

""Work for us,"" says the King, ""some of these great wonders."" Then Sheen
went forth out of the house, and she set herself to work spells on
Murtough, so that he knew not whether he was in his right mind or no.
She took of the water of the Boyne and made a magic wine thereout, and
she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff-balls of the woods,
and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats, and with
these she fed Murtough and the hosts. And when they had eaten, all their
strength went from them, and the magic wine sent them into an uneasy
sleep and restless slumbers."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,10,"And out of stones and sods of earth she
fashioned three battalions, and one of the battalions she placed at one
side of the house, and the other at the further side beyond it, and one
encircling the rest southward along the hollow windings of the glen. And
thus were these battalions, one of them all made of men stark-naked and
their colour blue, and the second with heads of goats with shaggy beards
and horned; but the third, more terrible than they, for these were
headless men, fighting like human beings, yet finished at the neck; and
the sound of heavy shouting as of hosts and multitudes came from the
first and the second battalion, but from the third no sound save only
that they waved their arms and struck their weapons together, and smote
the ground with their feet impatiently. And though terrible was the
shout of the blue men and the bleating of the goats with human limbs,
more horrible yet was the stamping and the rage of those headless men,
finished at the neck."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,11,"And Murtough, in his sleep and in his dreams, heard the battle-shout,
and he rose impetuously from off his bed, but the wine overcame him, and
his strength departed from him, and he fell helplessly upon the floor.
Then he heard the challenge a second time, and the stamping of the feet
without, and he rose again, and madly, fiercely, he set on them,
charging the hosts and scattering them before him, as he thought, as far
as the fairy palace of the Brugh. But all his strength was lost in
fighting phantoms, for they were but stones and sods and withered leaves
of the forest that he took for fighting men.

Now Duivsech, Murtough's wife, knew what was going on. She called upon
Cairnech to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of
his people, the men of Owen and of Niall, and together they went to the
fort; but Sheen guarded it well, so that they could by no means find an
entrance."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,12,"Then Cairnech was angry, and he cursed the place, and he dug a
grave before the door, and he stood up upon the mound of the grave, and
rang his bells and cursed the King and his house, and prophesied his
downfall. But he blessed the clans of Owen and of Niall, and they
returned to their own country.

Then Cairnech sent messengers to seek Murtough and to draw him away from
the witch woman who sought his destruction, but because she was so
lovely the King would believe no evil of her; and whenever he made any
sign to go to Cairnech, she threw her spell upon the King, so that he
could not break away. When he was so weak and faint that he had no power
left, she cast a sleep upon him, and she went round the house, putting
everything in readiness. She called upon her magic host of warriors, and
set them round the fortress, with their spears and javelins pointed
inwards towards the house, so that the King would not dare to go out
amongst them. And that night was a night of Samhain-tide, the eve of
Wednesday after All Souls' Day."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,13,"Then she went everywhere throughout the house, and took lighted brands
and burning torches, and scattered them in every part of the dwelling.
And she returned into the room wherein Murtough slept, and lay down by
his side. And she caused a great wind to spring up, and it came soughing
through the house from the north-west; and the King said, ""This is the
sigh of the winter night."" And Sheen smiled, because, unwittingly, the
King had spoken her name, for she knew by that that the hour of her
revenge had come. ""It is I myself that am Sigh and Winter Night,"" she
said, ""and I am Rough Wind and Storm, a daughter of fair nobles; and I
am Cry and Wail, the maid of elfin birth, who brings ill-luck to men.""

After that she caused a great snowstorm to come round the house; and
like the noise of troops and the rage of battle was the storm, beating
and pouring in on every side, so that drifts of deep snow were piled
against the walls, blocking the doors and chilling the folk that were
feasting within the house. But the King was lying in a heavy, unresting
sleep, and Sheen was at his side. Suddenly he screamed out of his sleep
and stirred himself, for he heard the crash of falling timbers and the
noise of the magic hosts, and he smelled the strong smell of fire in the
palace.

He sprang up. ""It seems to me,"" he cried, ""that hosts of demons are
around the house, and that they are slaughtering my people, and that the
house of Cletty is on fire."" ""It was but a dream,"" the witch maiden
said."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,14,"Then he slept again, and he saw a vision, to wit, that he was
tossing in a ship at sea, and the ship floundered, and above his head a
griffin, with sharp beak and talons, sailed, her wings outspread and
covering all the sun, so that it was dark as middle-night; and lo! as
she rose on high, her plumes quivered for a moment in the air; then down
she swooped and picked him from the waves, carrying him to her eyrie on
the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean; and the griffin began to
pierce him and to prod him with her talons, and to pick out pieces of
his flesh with her beak; and this went on awhile, and then a flame, that
came he knew not whence, rose from the nest, and he and the griffin were
enveloped in the flame. Then in her beak the griffin picked him up, and
together they fell downward over the cliff's edge into the seething
ocean; so that, half by fire and half by water, he died a miserable
death."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,15,"When the King saw that vision, he rose screaming from his sleep, and
donned his arms; and he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic
hosts, but he found no man to answer him. The damsel went forth from the
house, and Murtough made to follow her, but as he turned the flames
leaped out, and all between him and the door was one vast sheet of
flame. He saw no way of escape, save the vat of wine that stood in the
banqueting hall, and into that he got; but the burning timbers of the
roof fell upon his head and the hails of fiery sparks rained on him, so
that half of him was burned and half was drowned, as he had seen in his
dream."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,16,"The next day, amid the embers, the clerics found his corpse, and they
took it up and washed it in the Boyne, and carried it to Tuilen to bury
it. And they said, ""Alas! that Mac Erca, High King of Erin, of the noble
race of Conn and of the descendants of Ugaine the Great, should die
fighting with sods and stones! Alas! that the Cross of Christ was not
signed upon his face that he might have known the witchdoms of the
maiden what they were.""

As they went thus, bewailing the death of Murtough and bearing him to
his grave, Duivsech, wife of Murtough, met them, and when she found her
husband dead, she struck her hands together and she made a great and
mournful lamentation; and because weakness came upon her she leaned her
back against the ancient tree that is in Aenech Reil; and a burst of
blood broke from her heart, and there she died, grieving for her
husband."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,17,"And the grave of Murtough was made wide and deep, and there
they laid the Queen beside him, two in the one grave, near the north
side of the little church that is in Tuilen.

Now, when the burial was finished, and the clerics were reciting over
his grave the deeds of the King, and were making prayers for Murtough's
soul that it might be brought out of hell, for Cairnech showed great
care for this, they saw coming towards them across the sward a lonely
woman, star-bright and beautiful, and a kirtle of priceless silk upon
her, and a green mantle with its fringes of silver thread flowing to the
ground. She reached the place where the clerics were, and saluted them,
and they saluted her. And they marvelled at her beauty, but they
perceived on her an appearance of sadness and of heavy grief."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,18,"They asked of her, ""Who art thou, maiden, and wherefore art thou come to the house
of mourning? For a king lies buried here."" ""A king lies buried here,
indeed,"" said she, ""and I it was who slew him, Murtough of the many
deeds, of the race of Conn and Niall, High King of Ireland and of the
West. And though it was I who wrought his death, I myself will die for
grief of him.""

And they said, ""Tell us, maiden, why you brought him to his death, if so
be that he was dear to thee?"" And she said, ""Murtough was dear to me,
indeed, dearest of the men of the whole world; for I am Sheen, the
daughter of Sige, the son of Dian, from whom Ath Sigi or the 'Ford of
Sige' is called to-day. But Murtough slew my father, and my mother and
sister were slain along with him, in the battle of Cerb upon the Boyne,
and there was none of my house to avenge their death, save myself alone."
murtough-and-the-witch-woman,19,"Moreover, in his time the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin
were scattered and destroyed, the folk of the underworld and of my
fatherland; and to avenge the wrong and loss he wrought on them I slew
the man I loved. I made poison for him; alas! I made for him magic drink
and food which took his strength away, and out of the sods of earth and
puff-balls that float down the wind, I wrought men and armies of
headless, hideous folk, till all his senses were distraught. And, now,
take me to thee, O Cairnech, in fervent and true repentance, and sign
the Cross of Christ upon my brow, for the time of my death is come.""
Then she made penitence for the sin that she had sinned, and she died
there upon the grave of grief and of sorrow after the King. And they
digged a grave lengthways across the foot of the wide grave of Murtough
and his spouse, and there they laid the maiden who had wrought them woe.
And the clerics wondered at those things, and they wrote them and
revised them in a book."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,1,"Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda, or ""My Lord Bag of Rice."" His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,2,"One day he sallied forth in search of adventures, for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle. So he buckled on his two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself, in his hand, and slinging his quiver on his back started out. He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon. Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge. One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge, while its tail lay right against the other. The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it breathed, fire and smoke came out of its nostrils."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,3,"At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying in his path, for he must either turn back or walk right over its body. He was a brave man, however, and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly. Crunch, crunch! he stepped now on the dragon's body, now between its coils, and without even one glance backward he went on his way."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,4,"He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind. On turning back he was much surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place was a strange-looking man, who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground. His red hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the shape of a dragon's head, and his sea-green dress was patterned with shells. Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence. Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time? Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean? While these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed him:"
my-lord-bag-of-rice,5,"""Was it you that called me just now?""

""Yes, it was I,"" answered the man: ""I have an earnest request to make to you. Do you think you can grant it to me?""

""If it is in my power to do so I will,"" answered Hidesato, ""but first tell me who you are?""

""I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my home is in these waters just under this bridge.""

""And what is it you have to ask of me?"" said Hidesato.

""I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the mountain beyond,"" and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake.

""I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children. For some time past we have lived in terror, for a monster centipede has discovered our home, and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family. I am powerless to save them. If it goes on much longer like this, not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself must fall a victim to the monster. I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a human being."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,6,"For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in the hope that some strong brave man would come along. But all who came this way, as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could. You are the first man I have found able to look at me without fear, so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage. I beg you to have pity upon me. Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede?"""
my-lord-bag-of-rice,7,"Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story, and readily promised to do what he could to help him. The warrior asked where the centipede lived, so that he might attack the creature at once. The Dragon King replied that its home was on the mountain Mikami, but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would be better to wait till then. So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge. Strange to say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood. Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake. He had often heard of the Sea King's palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa. The dainty goldfishes, red carp, and silvery trout, waited upon the Dragon King and his guest."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,8,"Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him. The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony. As soon as they sat down, the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out, and behind them followed ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen. Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede. The Dragon King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp, tramp! as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,9,"Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony, and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer. The Dragon King stood by the warrior's side trembling with fear.

""The centipede! The centipede! Those two balls of fire are its eyes. It is coming for its prey! Now is the time to kill it.""

Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains, and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore.

Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear. He tried to calm the Dragon King.

""Don't be afraid. I shall surely kill the centipede. Just bring me my bow and arrows."""
my-lord-bag-of-rice,10,"The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver. He took the bow, and fitting an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let fly.

The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of penetrating, it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground.

Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly. Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head, only to glance off and fall to the ground. The centipede was invulnerable to weapons! When the Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior's arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he lost heart and began to tremble with fear."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,11,"The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede. He looked across the waters. The huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake. Nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes, and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,12,"Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes. But this was no ordinary centipede. This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror. Hidesato determined to try his last chance. So taking his last arrow and first putting the end of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow, took careful aim once more and let fly."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,13,"This time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before, it struck home to the creature's brain. Then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving, and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day, and then went out in blackness. A great darkness now overspread the heavens, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end. The Dragon King and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace, frightened to death, for the building was shaken to its foundation. At last the dreadful night was over. Day dawned beautiful and clear. The centipede was gone from the mountain."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,14,"Then Hidesato called to the Dragon King to come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear.

Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake. There lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water, which was dyed red with its blood.

The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds. The whole family came and bowed down before the warrior, calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all Japan."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,15,"Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous than the first. All kinds of fish, prepared in every imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes, were put before him, and the wine was the best that Hidesato had ever tasted in his life. To add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond, and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,16,"His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home, saying that he had now finished what he had come to do, and must return. The Dragon King and his family were all very sorry to have him leave so soon, but since he would go they begged him to accept a few small presents (so they said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering them forever from their horrible enemy the centipede."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,17,"As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave, a train of fish was suddenly transformed into a retinue of men, all wearing ceremonial robes and dragon's crowns on their heads to show that they were servants of the great Dragon King. The presents that they carried were as follows:

First, a large bronze bell.
Second, a bag of rice.
Third, a roll of silk.
Fourth, a cooking pot.
Fifth, a bell."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,18,"Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents, but as the Dragon King insisted, he could not well refuse.

The Dragon King himself accompanied the warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave of him with many bows and good wishes, leaving the procession of servants to accompany Hidesato to his house with the presents."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,19,"The warrior's household and servants had been very much concerned when they found that he did not return the night before, but they finally concluded that he had been kept by the violent storm and had taken shelter somewhere. When the servants on the watch for his return caught sight of him they called to every one that he was approaching, and the whole household turned out to meet him, wondering much what the retinue of men, bearing presents and banners, that followed him, could mean.

As soon as the Dragon King's retainers had put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato told all that had happened to him."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,20,"The presents which he had received from the grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic power. The bell only was ordinary, and as Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by, where it was hung up, to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood.

The single bag of rice, however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family, never grew less-the supply in the bag was inexhaustible."
my-lord-bag-of-rice,21,"The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter, though time after time long pieces were cut off to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to Court in at the New Year.

The cooking pot was wonderful, too. No matter what was put into it, it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing-truly a very economical saucepan.

The fame of Hidesato's fortune spread far and wide, and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing, he became very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth known as My Lord Bag of Rice."
naughty-boy,1,"A long time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without, and the rain streamed down from heaven. But the old poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the roasting apple hissed. ""Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,"" said the good old poet."
naughty-boy,2,"""Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!"" exclaimed suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while the rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle. ""Poor thing!"" said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There stood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long golden hair. He trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest."
naughty-boy,3,"""Poor child!"" said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand. ""Come in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!"" And the boy was so really. His eyes were like two bright stars. Although the water trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled with cold. He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite spoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one into the other."
naughty-boy,4,"The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little fellow on his lap. He squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine. Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet. ""You are a merry fellow,"" said the old man. ""What's your name?"" ""My name is Cupid,"" answered the boy. ""Don't you know me? There lies my bow. It shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window."""
naughty-boy,5,"""Why, your bow is quite spoiled,"" said the old poet. ""That were sad indeed,"" said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand and examined it on every side. ""Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at all. The string is quite tight. I will try it directly."" And he bent his bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart. ""You see now that my bow was not spoiled,"" said he laughing; and away he ran. The naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way! He who had taken him into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him warm wine and the very best apples! The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown into his heart. ""Fie!"" said he. ""How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will only cause them sorrow and many a heartache."""
naughty-boy,6,"And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is astonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the lectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his arm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along with him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves. Then, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. When the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to be confirmed, there he is again close behind them. Yes, he is forever following people. At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns in bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they soon discover it is something else. He roves about in the garden of the palace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and mother right in the heart. Ask them only and you will hear what they'll tell you."
naughty-boy,7,"Oh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have anything to do with him. He is forever running after everybody. Only think, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! But that is a long time ago, and it is all past now; however, a thing of that sort she never forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid! But now you know him, and you know, too, how ill-behaved he is!"
neighbor-underground,1,"Once upon a time there was a peasant who lived in Telemarken, and had a
big farm; yet he had nothing but bad luck with his cattle, and at last
lost his house and holding. He had scarcely anything left, and with the
little he had, he bought a bit of land that lay off to one side, far
away from the city, in the wildwood and the wilderness. One day, as he
was passing through his farm-yard, he met a man.

""Good-day, neighbor!"" said the man.

""Good-day,"" said the peasant, ""I thought I was all alone here. Are you
a neighbor of mine?""

""You can see my homestead over yonder,"" said the man. ""It is not far
from your own."" And there lay a farm-holding such as he had never before
seen, handsome and prosperous, and in fine condition. Then he knew very
well that this must be one of the underground people; yet he had no
fear, but invited his neighbor in to drink a glass with him, and the
neighbor seemed to enjoy it."
neighbor-underground,2,"""Listen,"" said the neighbor, ""there is one thing you must do for me as
a favor.""

""First let me know what it is,"" said the peasant.

""You must shift your cow-stable, because it is in my way,"" was the
answer he gave the peasant.

""No, I'll not do that,"" said the peasant. ""I put it up only this summer,
and the winter is coming on. What am I to do with my cattle then?""

""Well, do as you choose; but if you do not tear it down, you will live
to regret it,"" said his neighbor. And with that he went his way.

The peasant was surprised at this, and did not know what to do. It
seemed quite foolish to him to start in to tear down his stable when
the long winter night was approaching, and besides, he could not count
on help."
neighbor-underground,3,"One day as he was standing in his stable, he sank through the ground.
Down below, in the place to which he had come, everything was
unspeakably handsome. There was nothing which was not of gold or of
silver. Then the man who had called himself his neighbor came along, and
bade him sit down. After a time food was brought in on a silver platter,
and mead in a silver jug, and the neighbor invited him to draw up to
the table and eat. The peasant did not dare refuse, and sat down at
the table; but just as he was about to dip his spoon into the dish,
something fell down into his food from above, so that he lost his
appetite. ""Yes, yes,"" said the man, ""now you can see why we don't like
your stable. We can never eat in peace, for as soon as we sit down to a
meal, dirt and straw fall down, and no matter how hungry we may be, we
lose our appetites and cannot eat. But if you will do me the favor to
set up your stable elsewhere, you shall never go short of pasture nor
good crops, no matter how old you may grow to be. But if you won't, you
shall know naught but lean years all your life long."""
neighbor-underground,4,"When the peasant heard that, he went right to work pulling down his
stable, to put it up again in another place. Yet he could not have
worked alone, for at night, when all slept, the building of the new
stable went forward just as it did by day, and well he knew his neighbor
was helping him.

Nor did he regret it later, for he had enough of feed and corn, and his
cattle waxed fat. Once there was a year of scarcity, and feed was so
short that he was thinking of selling or slaughtering half his herd. But
one morning, when the milk-maid went into the stable, the dog was gone,
and with him all the cows and the calves. She began to cry and told the
peasant. But he thought to himself, that it was probably his neighbor's
doings, who had taken the cattle to pasture. And sure enough, so it was;
for toward spring, when the woods grew green, he saw the dog come along,
barking and leaping, by the edge of the forest, and after him followed
all the cows and calves, and the whole herd was so fat it was a pleasure
to look at it."
notscha,1,"The oldest daughter of the Ruler of Heaven had married the great general Li Dsing. Her sons were named Gintscha, Mutscha and Notscha. But when Notscha was given her, she dreamed at night that a Taoist priest came into her chamber and said: ""Swiftly receive the Heavenly Son!"" And straightway a radiant pearl glowed within her. And she was so frightened at her dream that she awoke. And when Notscha came into the world, it seemed as though a ball of flesh were turning in circles like a wheel, and the whole room was filled with strange fragrances and a crimson light."
notscha,2,"Li Dsing was much frightened, and thought it was an apparition. He clove the circling ball with his sword, and out of it leaped a small boy whose whole body glowed with a crimson radiance. But his face was delicately shaped and white as snow. About his right arm he wore a golden armlet and around his thighs was wound a length of crimson silk, whose glittering shine dazzled the eyes. When Li Dsing saw the child he took pity on him and did not slay him, while his wife began to love the boy dearly.

When three days had passed, all his friends came to wish him joy. They were just sitting at the festival meal when a Taoist priest entered and said: ""I am the Great One. This boy is the bright Pearl of the Beginning of Things, bestowed upon you as your son. Yet the boy is wild and unruly, and will kill many men. Therefore I will take him as my pupil to gentle his savage ways."" Li Dsing bowed his thanks and the Great One disappeared."
notscha,3,"When Notscha was seven years old he once ran away from home. He came to the river of nine bends, whose green waters flowed along between two rows of weeping-willows. The day was hot, and Notscha entered the water to cool himself. He unbound his crimson silk cloth and whisked it about in the water to wash it. But while Notscha sat there and whisked about his scarf in the water, it shook the castle of the Dragon-King of the Eastern Sea to its very foundations. So the Dragon-King sent out a Triton, terrible to look upon, who was to find out what was the matter. When the Triton saw the boy he began to scold. But the latter merely looked up and said: ""What a strange-looking beast you are, and you can actually talk!"" Then the Triton grew enraged, leaped up and struck at Notscha with his ax. But the latter avoided the blow, and threw his golden armlet at him. The armlet struck the Triton on the head and he sank down dead."
notscha,4,"Notscha laughed and said: ""And there he has gone and made my armlet bloody!"" And he once more sat down on a stone, in order to wash his armlet. Then the crystal castle of the dragon began to tremble as though it were about to fall apart. And a watchman also came and reported that the Triton had been slain by a boy. So the Dragon-King sent out his son to capture the boy. And the son seated himself on the water-cleaving beast, and came up with a thunder of great waves of water. Notscha straightened up and said: ""That is a big wave!"" Suddenly he saw a creature rise out of the waves, on whose back sat an armed man who cried in a loud voice: ""Who has slain my Triton?"" Notscha answered: ""The Triton wanted to slay me so I killed him. What difference does it make?"" Then the dragon assailed him with his halberd."
notscha,5,"But Notscha said: ""Tell me who you are before we fight."" ""I am the son of the Dragon-King,"" was the reply. ""And I am Notscha, the son of General Li Dsing. You must not rouse my anger with your violence, or I will skin you, together with that old mud-fish, your father!"" Then the dragon grew wild with rage, and came storming along furiously. But Notscha cast his crimson cloth into the air, so that it flashed like a ball of fire, and cast the dragon-youth from his breast. Then Notscha took his golden armlet and struck him on the forehead with it, so that he had to reveal himself in his true form as a golden dragon, and fall down dead."
notscha,6,"Notscha laughed and said: ""I have heard tell that dragon-sinews make good cords. I will draw one out and bring it to my father, and he can tie his armor together with it."" And with that he drew out the dragon's back sinew and took it home.

In the meantime the Dragon-King, full of fury, had hastened to Notscha's father Li Dsing and demanded that Notscha be delivered up to him. But Li Dsing replied: ""You must be mistaken, for my boy is only seven years old and incapable of committing such misdeeds."" While they were still quarreling Notscha came running up and cried: ""Father, I'm bringing along a dragon's sinew for you, so that you may bind up your armor with it!"" Now the dragon broke out into tears and furious scolding. He threatened to report Li Dsing to the Ruler of the Heaven, and took himself off, snorting with rage."
notscha,7,"Li Dsing grew very much excited, told his wife what had happened, and both began to weep. Notscha, however, came to them and said: ""Why do you weep? I will just go to my master, the Great One, and he will know what is to be done."" And no sooner had he said the words than he had disappeared. He came into his master's presence and told him the whole tale. The latter said: ""You must get ahead of the dragon, and prevent him from accusing you in Heaven!"" Then he did some magic, and Notscha found himself set down by the gate of Heaven, where he waited for the dragon. It was still early in the morning; the gate of Heaven had not yet been opened, nor was the watchman at his post. But the dragon was already climbing up. Notscha, whom his master's magic had rendered invisible, threw the dragon to the ground with his armlet, and began to pitch into him."
notscha,8,"The dragon scolded and screamed. ""There the old worm flounders about,"" said Notscha, ""and does not care how hard he is beaten! I will scratch off some of his scales."" And with these words he began to tear open the dragon's festal garments, and rip off some of the scales beneath his left arm, so that the red blood dripped out. Then the dragon could no longer stand the pain and begged for mercy. But first he had to promise Notscha that he would not complain of him, before the latter would let him go. And then the dragon had to turn himself into a little green snake, which Notscha put into his sleeve and took back home with him. But no sooner had he drawn the little snake from his sleeve than it assumed human shape. The dragon then swore that he would punish Li Dsing in a terrible manner, and disappeared in a flash of lightning."
notscha,9,"Li Dsing was now angry with his son in earnest. Therefore Notscha's mother sent him to the rear of the house to keep out of his father's sight. Notscha disappeared and went to his master, in order to ask him what he should do when the dragon returned. His master advised him and Notscha went back home. And all the Dragon Kings of the four seas were assembled, and had bound his parents, with cries and tumult, in order to punish them. Notscha ran up and cried with a loud voice: ""I will take the punishment for whatever I have done! My parents are blameless! What is the punishment you wish to lay upon me?"" ""Life for life!"" said the dragon. ""Very well then, I will destroy myself!"" And so he did and the dragons went off satisfied; while Notscha's mother buried him with many tears."
notscha,10,"But the spiritual part of Notscha, his soul, fluttered about in the air, and was driven by the wind to the cave of the Great One. He took it in and said to it: ""You must appear to your mother! Forty miles distant from your home rises a green mountain cliff. On this cliff she must build a shrine for you. And after you have enjoyed the incense of human adoration for three years, you shall once more have a human body."" Notscha appeared to his mother in a dream, and gave her the whole message, and she awoke in tears. But Li Dsing grew angry when she told him about it. ""It serves the accursed boy right that he is dead! It is because you are always thinking of him that he appears to you in dreams. You must pay no attention to him."" The woman said no more, but thenceforward he appeared to her daily, as soon as she closed her eyes, and grew more and more urgent in his demand. Finally all that was left for her to do was to erect a temple for Notscha without Li Dsing's knowledge.

And Notscha performed great miracles in his temple. All prayers made in it were granted. And from far away people streamed to it to burn incense in his honor."
notscha,11,"Thus half a year passed. Then Li Dsing, on the occasion of a great military drill, once came by the cliff in question, and saw the people crowding thickly about the hill like a swarm of ants. Li Dsing inquired what there were to see upon the hill. ""It is a new god, who performs so many miracles that people come from far and near to honor him."" ""What sort of a god is he?"" asked Li Dsing. They did not dare conceal from him who the god was. Then Li Dsing grew angry. He spurred his horse up the hill and, sure enough, over the door of the temple was written: ""Notscha's Shrine."" And within it was the likeness of Notscha, just as he had appeared while living. Li Dsing said: ""While you were alive you brought misfortune to your parents. Now that you are dead you deceive the people. It is disgusting!"" With these words he drew forth his whip, beat Notscha's idolatrous likeness to pieces with it, had the temple burned down, and the worshipers mildly reproved. Then he returned home."
notscha,12,"Now Notscha had been absent in the spirit upon that day. When he returned he found his temple destroyed; and the spirit of the hill gave him the details. Notscha hurried to his master and related with tears what had befallen him. The latter was roused and said: ""It is Li Dsing's fault. After you had given back your body to your parents, you were no further concern of his. Why should he withdraw from you the enjoyment of the incense?"" Then the Great One made a body of lotus-plants, gave it the gift of life, and enclosed the soul of Notscha within it. This done he called out in a loud voice: ""Arise!"" A drawing of breath was heard, and Notscha leaped up once more in the shape of a small boy. He flung himself down before his master and thanked him. The latter bestowed upon him the magic of the fiery lance, and Notscha thenceforward had two whirling wheels beneath his feet: The wheel of the wind and the wheel of fire. With these he could rise up and down in the air. The master also gave him a bag of panther-skin in which to keep his armlet and his silken cloth."
notscha,13,"Now Notscha had determined to punish Li Dsing. Taking advantage of a moment when he was not watched, he went away, thundering along on his rolling wheels to Li Dsing's dwelling. The latter was unable to withstand him and fled. He was almost exhausted when his second son, Mutscha, the disciple of the holy Pu Hain, came to his aid from the Cave of the White Crane. A violent quarrel took place between the brothers; they began to fight, and Mutscha was overcome; while Notscha once more rushed in pursuit of Li Dsing. At the height of his extremity, however, the holy Wen Dschu of the Hill of the Five Dragons, the master of Gintscha, Li Dsing's oldest son, stepped forth and hid Li Dsing in his cave. Notscha, in a rage, insisted that he be delivered up to him; but Wen Dschu said: ""Elsewhere you may indulge your wild nature to your heart's content, but not in this place."""
notscha,14,"And when Notscha in the excess of his rage turned his fiery lance upon him, Wen Dschu stepped back a pace, shook the seven-petaled lotus from his sleeve, and threw it into the air. A whirlwind arose, clouds and mists obscured the sight, and sand and earth were flung up from the ground. Then the whirlwind collapsed with a great crash. Notscha fainted, and when he regained consciousness found himself bound to a golden column with three thongs of gold, so that he could no longer move. Wen Dschu now called Gintscha to him and ordered him to give his unruly brother a good thrashing. And this he did, while Notscha, obliged to stand it, stood grinding his teeth. In his extremity he saw the Great One floating by, and called out to him: ""Save me, O Master!"" But the latter did not notice him; instead he entered the cave and thanked Wen Dschu for the severe lesson which he had given Notscha."
notscha,15,"Finally they called Notscha in to them and ordered him to be reconciled to his father. Then they dismissed them both and seated themselves to play chess. But no sooner was Notscha free than he again fell into a rage, and renewed his pursuit of his father. He had again overtaken Li Dsing when still another saint came forward to defend the latter. This time it was the old Buddha of the Radiance of the Light. When Notscha attempted to battle with him he raised his arm, and a pagoda shaped itself out of red, whirling clouds and closed around Notscha. Then Radiance of Light placed both his hands on the pagoda and a fire arose within it which burned Notscha so that he cried loudly for mercy. Then he had to promise to beg his father's forgiveness and always to obey him in the future. Not till he had promised all this did the Buddha let him out of the pagoda again. And he gave the pagoda to Li Dsing; and taught him a magic saying which would give him the mastery over Notscha. It is for this reason that Li Dsing is called the Pagoda-bearing King of Heaven."
notscha,16,"Later on Li Dsing and his three sons, Gintscha, Mutscha and Notscha, aided King Wu of the Dschou dynasty to destroy the tyrant Dschou-Sin.

None could withstand their might. Only once did a sorcerer succeed in wounding Notscha in the left arm. Any other would have died of the wound. But the Great One carried him into his cave, healed his wound and gave him three goblets of the wine of the gods to drink, and three fire-dates to eat. When Notscha had eaten and drunk he suddenly heard a crash at his left side and another arm grew out from it. He could not speak and his eyes stood out from their sockets with horror. But it went on as it had begun: six more arms grew out of his body and two more heads, so that finally he had three heads and eight arms. He called out to his Master: ""What does all this mean?"" But the latter only laughed and said: ""All is as it should be. Thus equipped you will really be strong!"" Then he taught him a magic incantation by means of which he could make his arms and heads visible or invisible as he chose. When the tyrant Dschou-Sin had been destroyed, Li Dsing and his three sons, while still on earth, were taken up into heaven and seated among the gods."
ogre-of-rashomon,1,"Long, long ago in Kyoto, the people of the city were terrified by accounts of a dreadful ogre, who, it was said, haunted the Gate of Rashomon at twilight and seized whoever passed by. The missing victims were never seen again, so it was whispered that the ogre was a horrible cannibal, who not only killed the unhappy victims but ate them also. Now everybody in the town and neighborhood was in great fear, and no one durst venture out after sunset near the Gate of Rashomon."
ogre-of-rashomon,2,"Now at this time there lived in Kyoto a general named Raiko, who had made himself famous for his brave deeds. Some time before this he made the country ring with his name, for he had attacked Oeyama, where a band of ogres lived with their chief, who instead of wine drank the blood of human beings. He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster"
ogre-of-rashomon,3,"This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights. In this band there were five knights of great valor. One evening as the five knights sat at a feast quaffing SAKE in their rice bowls and eating all kinds of fish, raw, and stewed, and broiled, and toasting each other's healths and exploits, the first knight, Hojo, said to the others:"
ogre-of-rashomon,4,"""Have you all heard the rumor that every evening after sunset there comes an ogre to the Gate of Rashomon, and that he seizes all who pass by?""

The second knight, Watanabe, answered him, saying:

""Do not talk such nonsense! All the ogres were killed by our chief Raiko at Oeyama! It cannot be true, because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to show themselves in this city, for they know that our brave master would at once attack them if he knew that any of them were still alive!""

""Then do you disbelieve what I say, and think that I am telling you a falsehood?""

""No, I do not think that you are telling a lie,"" said Watanabe; ""but you have heard some old woman's story which is not worth believing.""

""Then the best plan is to prove what I say, by going there yourself and finding out yourself whether it is true or not,"" said Hojo."
ogre-of-rashomon,5,"Watanabe, the second knight, could not bear the thought that his companion should believe he was afraid, so he answered quickly:

""Of course, I will go at once and find out for myself!""

So Watanabe at once got ready to go-he buckled on his long sword and put on a coat of armor, and tied on his large helmet. When he was ready to start he said to the others:

""Give me something so that I can prove I have been there!"""
ogre-of-rashomon,6,"Then one of the men got a roll of writing paper and his box of Indian ink and brushes, and the four comrades wrote their names on a piece of paper.

""I will take this,"" said Watanabe, ""and put it on the Gate of Rashomon, so to-morrow morning will you all go and look at it? I may be able to catch an ogre or two by then!"" and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly."
ogre-of-rashomon,7,"It was a very dark night, and there was neither moon nor star to light Watanabe on his way. To make the darkness worse a storm came on, the rain fell heavily and the wind howled like wolves in the mountains. Any ordinary man would have trembled at the thought of going out of doors, but Watanabe was a brave warrior and dauntless, and his honor and word were at stake, so he sped on into the night, while his companions listened to the sound of his horse's hoofs dying away in the distance, then shut the sliding shutters close and gathered round the charcoal fire and wondered what would happen-and whether their comrade would encounter one of those horrible Oni."
ogre-of-rashomon,8,"At last Watanabe reached the Gate of Rashomon, but peer as he might through the darkness he could see no sign of an ogre.

""It is just as I thought,"" said Watanabe to himself; ""there are certainly no ogres here; it is only an old woman's story. I will stick this paper on the gate so that the others can see I have been here when they come to-morrow, and then I will take my way home and laugh at them all.""

He fastened the piece of paper, signed by all his four companions, on the gate, and then turned his horse's head towards home."
ogre-of-rashomon,9,"As he did so he became aware that some one was behind him, and at the same time a voice called out to him to wait. Then his helmet was seized from the back. ""Who are you?"" said Watanabe fearlessly. He then put out his hand and groped around to find out who or what it was that held him by the helmet. As he did so he touched something that felt like an arm-it was covered with hair and as big round as the trunk of a tree!

Watanabe knew at once that this was the arm of an ogre, so he drew his sword and cut at it fiercely.

There was a loud yell of pain, and then the ogre dashed in front of the warrior."
ogre-of-rashomon,10,"Watanabe's eyes grew large with wonder, for he saw that the ogre was taller than the great gate, his eyes were flashing like mirrors in the sunlight, and his huge mouth was wide open, and as the monster breathed, flames of fire shot out of his mouth.

The ogre thought to terrify his foe, but Watanabe never flinched. He attacked the ogre with all his strength, and thus they fought face to face for a long time. At last the ogre, finding that he could neither frighten nor beat Watanabe and that he might himself be beaten, took to flight. But Watanabe, determined not to let the monster escape, put spurs to his horse and gave chase."
ogre-of-rashomon,11,"But though the knight rode very fast the ogre ran faster, and to his disappointment he found himself unable to overtake the monster, who was gradually lost to sight.

Watanabe returned to the gate where the fierce fight had taken place, and got down from his horse. As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground.

Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight. His joy was great at having secured such a prize, for this was the best of all proofs of his adventure with the ogre. So he took it up carefully and carried it home as a trophy of his victory."
ogre-of-rashomon,12,"When he got back, he showed the arm to his comrades, who one and all called him the hero of their band and gave him a great feast. His wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in Kyoto, and people from far and near came to see the ogre's arm.

Watanabe now began to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety, for he knew that the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive. He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again. Watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron. In this he placed the arm, and then he sealed down the heavy lid, refusing to open it for anyone. He kept the box in his own room and took charge of it himself, never allowing it out of his sight."
ogre-of-rashomon,13,"Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch, asking for admittance.

When the servant went to the door to see who it was, there was only an old woman, very respectable in appearance. On being asked who she was and what was her business, the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby. If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him."
ogre-of-rashomon,14,"The servant left the old woman at the door and went to tell his master that his old nurse had come to see him. Watanabe thought it strange that she should come at that time of night, but at the thought of his old nurse, who had been like a foster-mother to him and whom he had not seen for a long time, a very tender feeling sprang up for her in his heart. He ordered the servant to show her in."
ogre-of-rashomon,15,"The old woman was ushered into the room, and after the customary bows and greetings were over, she said:

""Master, the report of your brave fight with the ogre at the Gate of Rashomon is so widely known that even your poor old nurse has heard of it. Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms? If you did, your deed is highly to be praised!""

""I was very disappointed,"" said Watanabe, ""that I was not able take the monster captive, which was what I wished to do, instead of only cutting off an arm!""

""I am very proud to think,"" answered the old woman, ""that my master was so brave as to dare to cut off an ogre's arm. There is nothing that can be compared to your courage. Before I die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm,"" she added pleadingly."
ogre-of-rashomon,16,"""No,"" said Watanabe, ""I am sorry, but I cannot grant your request.""

""But why?"" asked the old woman.

""Because,"" replied Watanabe, ""ogres are very revengeful creatures, and if I open the box there is no telling but that the ogre may suddenly appear and carry off his arm. I have had a box made on purpose with a very strong lid, and in this box I keep the ogre's arm secure; and I never show it to any one, whatever happens.""

""Your precaution is very reasonable,"" said the old woman. ""But I am your old nurse, so surely you will not refuse to show ME the arm. I have only just heard of your brave act, and not being able to wait till the morning I came at once to ask you to show it to me."""
ogre-of-rashomon,17,"Watanabe was very troubled at the old woman's pleading, but he still persisted in refusing. Then the old woman said:

""Do you suspect me of being a spy sent by the ogre?""

""No, of course I do not suspect you of being the ogre's spy, for you are my old nurse,"" answered Watanabe.

""Then you cannot surely refuse to show me the arm any longer."" entreated the old woman; ""for it is the great wish of my heart to see for once in my life the arm of an ogre!""

Watanabe could not hold out in his refusal any longer, so he gave in at last, saying:

""Then I will show you the ogre's arm, since you so earnestly wish to see it. Come, follow me!"" and he led the way to his own room, the old woman following."
ogre-of-rashomon,18,"When they were both in the room Watanabe shut the door carefully, and then going towards a big box which stood in a corner of the room, he took off the heavy lid. He then called to the old woman to come near and look in, for he never took the arm out of the box.

""What is it like? Let me have a good look at it,"" said the old nurse, with a joyful face."
ogre-of-rashomon,19,"She came nearer and nearer, as if she were afraid, till she stood right against the box. Suddenly she plunged her hand into the box and seized the arm, crying with a fearful voice which made the room shake:

""Oh, joy! I have got my arm back again!""

And from an old woman she was suddenly transformed into the towering figure of the frightful ogre!"
ogre-of-rashomon,20,"Watanabe sprang back and was unable to move for a moment, so great was his astonishment; but recognizing the ogre who had attacked him at the Gate of Rashomon, he determined with his usual courage to put an end to him this time. He seized his sword, drew it out of its sheath in a flash, and tried to cut the ogre down.

So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape. But the ogre sprang up to the ceiling, and bursting through the roof, disappeared in the mist and clouds."
ogre-of-rashomon,21,"In this way the ogre escaped with his arm. The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment, but that was all he could do. He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre. But the latter was afraid of Watanabe's great strength and daring, and never troubled Kyoto again. So once more the people of the city were able to go out without fear even at night time, and the brave deeds of Watanabe have never been forgotten!"
ola-storbaekkjen,1,"Once upon a time there lived a man in the forest of Dovre whose name was
Ola Storbaekkjen. He was of giant build, powerful and fearless. During
the winter he did not work, but traveled from one fair to another,
hunting up quarrels and brawls. From Christiansmarkt he went to Branaes
and Konigsberg, and thence to Grundsaet, and wherever he came squabbles
and brawls broke out, and in every brawl he was the victor. In the
summer he dealt in cattle at Valders and the fjords, and fought with the
fjord-folk and the hill people of Halling and Valders, and always had
the best of it. But sometimes they scratched him a bit with the knife,
did those folk."
ola-storbaekkjen,2,"Now once, at the time of the hay harvest, he was home at Baekkjen, and
had lain down to take a little after-dinner nap under the penthouse. And
he was taken into the hill, which happened in the following way: A man
with a pair of gilded goat's horns came along and butted Ola, but Ola
fell upon him so that the man had to duck back, again and again. But the
stranger stood up once more, and began to butt again. Finally he
took Ola under his arm like a glove, and then both of them flew straight
off into the hill."
ola-storbaekkjen,3,"In the place to which they came all was adorned with silver plates and
dishes, and with ornaments of silver, and Ola thought that the king
himself had nothing finer. They offered him a drink, which he drank; but
he would not eat, for the food did not seem to him to be appetizing.
Suddenly the man with the gilded goat's horns came in, and gave Ola a
shove before he knew it; but Ola came back at him as before, and so they
beat and pulled each other through all the rooms, and along all the
walls. Ola was of the opinion that they had been at it all night long;
but by that time the scuffle had lasted over fourteen days, and they had
already tolled the church bells for him on three successive Thursday
evenings. On the third Thursday evening he was in ill ease, for the
people in the hill had in mind to thrust him forth. When the bells
stopped ringing, he sat at a crack in the hill, with his head looking
out. Had not a man come by and happened to spy him, and told the people
to keep on ringing the church-bells, the hill would have closed over him
again, and he would probably still be inside. But when he came out he
had been so badly beaten, and was so miserable, that it passed all
measure. The lumps on his head were each bigger than the other, his
whole body was black and blue, and he was quite out of his mind. And
from time to time he would leap up, run off and try to get back into the
hill to take up his quarrel again, and fight for the gilded goat's
horns. For those he wanted to break from the giant's forehead."
old-street-lamp,1,"DID you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is not remarkably interesting, but for once you may as well listen to it. It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, many years of service and now was to retire with a pension. It was this very evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street. Its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten."
old-street-lamp,2,"The lamp had very great anxiety about the next day, for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council, who were to decide whether it was fit for further service; whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some factory. If the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down. In this latter case it might be turned into anything, and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. This troubled it exceedingly."
old-street-lamp,3,"Whatever might happen, it seemed certain that the lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whose family it looked upon as its own. The lamp had first been hung up on the very evening that the watchman, then a robust young man, had entered upon the duties of his office. Ah, well! it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman. His wife had some little pride in those days; she condescended to glance at the lamp only when she passed by in the evening--never in the daytime. But in later years, when all of them--the watchman, the wife, and the lamp--had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaning it and keeping it supplied with oil. The old people were thoroughly honest; they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it."
old-street-lamp,4,"This was the lamp's last night in the street, and to-morrow it must go to the town hall--two very dark things to think of. No wonder it did not burn brightly. How many persons it had lighted on their way, and how much it had seen! As much, very likely, as the mayor and corporation themselves! None of these thoughts were uttered aloud, however, for the lamp was good and honorable and would not willingly do harm to any one, especially to those in authority. As one thing after another was recalled to its mind, the light would flash up with sudden brightness. At such moments the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered."
old-street-lamp,5,"""There was a handsome young man, once,"" thought the lamp; ""it is certainly a long while ago, but I remember that he had a little note, written on pink paper with a gold edge. The writing was elegant, evidently a lady's. Twice he read it through, and kissed it, and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly, 'I am the happiest of men!' Only he and I know what was written on this, his first letter from his lady-love. Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that I remember; it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another! A funeral passed through the street. A young and beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands of flowers, and attended by torches which quite overpowered my light. All along the street stood the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join the procession. But when the torches had passed from before me and I could look around, I saw one person standing alone, leaning against my post and weeping. Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me."""
old-street-lamp,6,"These and similar reflections occupied the old street lamp on this the last time that its light would shine. The sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows, at least, who will be his successor, and may whisper a few words to him. But the lamp did not know its successor, or it might have given him a few hints respecting rain or mist and might have informed him how far the moon's rays would reach, and from which side the wind generally blew, and so on."
old-street-lamp,7,"On the bridge over the canal stood three persons who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought it could give the office to whomsoever it chose. The first was a herring's head, which could emit light in the darkness. He remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post. Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines in the dark. He considered himself descended from an old stem, once the pride of the forest. The third was a glowworm, and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine; yet there he was, and could really give light as well as the others. But the rotten wood and the herring's head declared most solemnly, by all they held sacred, that the glowworm only gave light at certain times and must not be allowed to compete with them. The old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp, but they would believe nothing that it said. When they discovered that it had not the power of naming its successor, they said they were very glad to hear it, for the lamp was too old and worn out to make a proper choice."
old-street-lamp,8,"At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of the street and through the air-holes of the old lamp. ""What is this I hear?"" it asked. ""Are you going away to-morrow? Is this evening the last time we shall meet? Then I must present you with a farewell gift. I will blow into your brain, so that in future not only shall you be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the past, but your light within shall be so bright that you will be able to understand all that is said or done in your presence."" ""Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,"" said the old lamp. ""I thank you most heartily. I only hope I shall not be melted down."" ""That is not likely to happen yet,"" said the wind. ""I will also blow a memory into you, so that, should you receive other similar presents, your old age will pass very pleasantly."" ""That is, if I am not melted down,"" said the lamp. ""But should I, in that case, still retain my memory?"" ""Do be reasonable, old lamp,"" said the wind, puffing away."
old-street-lamp,9,"At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. ""What will you give the old lamp?"" asked the wind. ""I can give nothing,"" she replied. ""I am on the wane, and no lamps have ever given me light, while I have frequently shone upon them."" With these words the moon hid herself again behind the clouds, that she might be saved from further importunities. Just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house, but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts. ""I shall penetrate you so thoroughly,"" it said, ""that you will have the power of becoming rusty, and, if you wish it, can crumble into dust in one night."" But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the wind thought so, too. ""Does no one give any more? Will no one give any more?"" shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it could. Then a bright, falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous streak behind it."
old-street-lamp,10,"""What was that?"" cried the herring's head. ""Did not a star fall? I really believe it went into the lamp. Certainly, when such high-born personages try for the office we may as well go home."" And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a wonderfully strong light all around."
old-street-lamp,11,"""This is a glorious gift,"" it said. ""The bright stars have always been a joy to me and have always shone more brilliantly than I ever could shine, though I have tried with my whole might. Now they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember, as if it still stood before me, and to let it be seen by all those who love me. And herein lies the truest happiness, for pleasures which we cannot share with others are only half enjoyed."""
old-street-lamp,12,"""That sentiment does you honor,"" said the wind; ""but for this purpose wax lights will be necessary. If these are not lighted in you, your peculiar faculties will not benefit others in the least. The stars have not thought of this. They suppose that you and every other light must be a wax taper. But I must go down now."" So it laid itself to rest.

""Wax tapers, indeed!"" said the lamp; ""I have never yet had these, nor is it likely I ever shall. If I could only be sure of not being melted down!"""
old-street-lamp,13,"The next day--well, perhaps we had better pass over the next day. The evening had come, and the lamp was resting in a grandfather's chair; and guess where! Why, at the old watchman's house. He had begged as a favor that the mayor and corporation would allow him to keep the street lamp in consideration of his long and faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties, four and twenty years ago. He looked upon it almost as his own child. He had no children, so the lamp was given to him."
old-street-lamp,14,"There lay the lamp in the great armchair near the warm stove. It seemed almost to have grown larger, for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The old people sat at their supper, casting friendly glances at it, and would willingly have admitted it to a place at the table. It is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground, and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room. But within, it was warm and comfortable, and strips of list had been nailed round the door. The bed and the little window had curtains, and everything looked clean and neat. On the window seat stood two curious flowerpots, which a sailor named Christian had brought from the East or West Indies. They were of clay, and in the form of two elephants with open backs; they were filled with earth, and through the open space flowers bloomed. In one grew some very fine chives or leeks; this was the kitchen garden. The other, which contained a beautiful geranium, they called their flower garden."
old-street-lamp,15,"On the wall hung a large colored print, representing the Congress of Vienna and all the kings and emperors. A clock with heavy weights hung on the wall and went ""tick, tick,"" steadily enough; yet it was always rather too fast, which, however, the old people said was better than being too slow. They were now eating their supper, while the old street lamp, as we have heard, lay in the grandfather's armchair near the stove."
old-street-lamp,16,"It seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round. But after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through together--in rain and in fog, during the short, bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights, through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt that all was well again. It saw everything that had happened quite clearly, as if the events were passing before it. Surely the wind had given it an excellent gift!"
old-street-lamp,17,"The old people were very active and industrious; they were never idle for even a single hour. On Sunday afternoons they would bring out some books, generally a book of travels which they greatly liked. The old man would read aloud about Africa, with its great forests and the wild elephants, while his wife would listen attentively, stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants which served as flowerpots. ""I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,"" she said. Ah! how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in it, for then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it did itself; the lofty trees, with their thickly entwined branches, the naked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy feet."
old-street-lamp,18,"""What is the use of all my capabilities,"" sighed the old lamp, ""when I cannot obtain any wax lights? They have only oil and tallow here, and these will not do."" One day a great heap of wax-candle ends found their way into the cellar. The larger pieces were burned, and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread. So there were now candles enough, but it never occurred to any one to put a little piece in the lamp. ""Here I am now, with my rare powers,"" thought the lamp. ""I have faculties within me, but I cannot share them. They do not know that I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry, or change them into noble forests or, indeed, to anything else they might wish."""
old-street-lamp,19,"The lamp, however, was always kept clean and shining in a corner, where it attracted all eyes. Strangers looked upon it as lumber, but the old people did not care for that; they loved it. One day--it was the watchman's birthday--the old woman approached the lamp, smiling to herself, and said, ""I will have an illumination to-day, in honor of my old man."" The lamp rattled in its metal frame, for it thought, ""Now at last I shall have a light within me."" But, after all, no wax light was placed in the lamp--only oil, as usual."
old-street-lamp,20,"The lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life. Then it had a dream; for to one with its faculties, dreaming was not difficult. It dreamed that the old people were dead and that it had been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down. This caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall. But though it had been endowed with the power of falling into decay from rust when it pleased, it did not make use of this power. It was therefore put into the melting furnace and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish to see--one intended to hold a wax taper. The candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a nosegay, in the center of which the wax taper was to be placed. It was to stand on a green writing table in a very pleasant room, where there were many books scattered about and splendid paintings on the walls."
old-street-lamp,21,"The owner of the room was a poet and a man of intellect. Everything he thought or wrote was pictured around him. Nature showed herself to him sometimes in the dark forests, sometimes in cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting about, or on the deck of a ship sailing across the foaming sea, with the clear, blue sky above, or at night in the glittering stars."
old-street-lamp,22,"""What powers I possess!"" said the lamp, awaking from its dream. ""I could almost wish to be melted down; but no, that must not be while the old people live. They love me for myself alone; they keep me bright and supply me with oil. I am as well off as the picture of the Congress, in which they take so much pleasure."" And from that time it felt at rest in itself, and not more so than such an honorable old lamp really deserved to be."
old-sultan,1,"THERE was once a peasant who owned a faithful dog called Sultan, now
grown so old that he had lost all his teeth, and could lay hold of
nothing. One day the man was standing at the door of his house with his
wife, and he said,

""I shall kill old Sultan to-morrow; he is of no good any longer.""

His wife felt sorry for the poor dog, and answered, ""He has served us
for so many years, and has kept with us so faithfully, he deserves food
and shelter in his old age.""

""Dear me, you do not seem to understand the matter,"" said the husband;
""he has never a tooth, and no thief would mind him in the least, so I do
not see why he should not be made away with. If he has served us well,
we have given him plenty of good food."""
old-sultan,2,"The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, heard
all they said, and was very sad to think that the next day would be his
last. He bethought him of his great friend the wolf, and slipped out in
the evening to the wood to see him, and related to him the fate that was
awaiting him.

""Listen to me, old fellow,"" said the wolf; ""be of good courage, I will
help you in your need. I have thought of a way. Early to-morrow morning
your master is going hay-making with his wife, and they will take their
child with them, so that no one will be left at home. They will be sure
to lay the child in the shade behind the hedge while they are at work;
you must lie by its side, just as if you were watching it. Then I will
come out of the wood and steal away the child; you must rush after me,
as if to save it from me. Then I must let it fall, and you must bring it
back again to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and
will be much too grateful to do you any harm; on the contrary, you will
be received into full favour, and they will never let you want for
anything again."""
old-sultan,3,"The dog was pleased with the plan, which was carried out accordingly.
When the father saw the wolf running away with his child he cried out,
and when old Sultan brought it back again, he was much pleased with him,
and patted him, saying,

""Not a hair of him shall be touched; he shall have food and shelter as
long as he lives."" And he said to his wife,

""Go home directly and make some good stew for old Sultan, something that
does not need biting; and get the pillow from my bed for him to lie on.""

From that time old Sultan was made so comfortable that he had nothing
left to wish for. Before long the wolf paid him a visit, to congratulate
him that all had gone so well."
old-sultan,4,"""But, old fellow,"" said he, ""you must wink at my making off by chance
with a fat sheep of your master's; perhaps one will escape some fine
day.""

""Don't reckon on that,"" answered the dog; ""I cannot consent to it; I
must remain true to my master.""

But the wolf, not supposing it was said in earnest, came sneaking in the
night to carry off the sheep. But the master, who had been warned by the
faithful Sultan of the wolf's intention, was waiting for him, and gave
him a fine hiding with the threshing-flail. So the wolf had to make his
escape, calling out to the dog,

""You shall pay for this, you traitor!"""
old-sultan,5,"The next morning the wolf sent the wild boar to call out the dog; and to
appoint a meeting in the wood to receive satisfaction from him. Old
Sultan could find no second but a cat with three legs; and as they set
off together, the poor thing went limping along, holding her tail up in
the air. The wolf and his second were already on the spot; when they saw
their antagonists coming, and caught sight of the elevated tail of the
cat, they thought it was a sabre they were bringing with them. And as
the poor thing came limping on three legs, they supposed it was lifting
a big stone to throw at them. This frightened them very much; the wild
boar crept among the leaves, and the wolf clambered up into a tree. And
when the dog and cat came up, they were surprised not to see any one
there. However, the wild boar was not perfectly hidden in the leaves,
and the tips of his ears peeped out. And when the cat caught sight of
one, she thought it was a mouse, and sprang upon it, seizing it with her
teeth. Out leaped the wild boar with a dreadful cry, and ran away
shouting,"
old-sultan,6,"""There is the culprit in the tree!""

And the dog and the cat looking up caught sight of the wolf, who came
down, quite ashamed of his timidity, and made peace with the dog once
more."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,1,"There once lived an Indian in the north who had ten daughters, all of
whom grew up to womanhood. They were noted for their beauty, especially
Oweenee, the youngest, who was very independent in her way of thinking.
She was a great admirer of romantic places, and spent much of her time
with the flowers and winds and clouds in the open air. Though the flower
were homely, if it was fragrant--though the wind were rough, if it was
healthful--and though the cloud were dark, if it embosomed the fruitful
rain, she knew how, in spite of appearances, to acknowledge the good
qualities concealed from the eye. She paid very little attention to the
many handsome young men who came to her father's lodge for the purpose
of seeing her."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,2,"Her elder sisters were all sought in marriage, and one after the other
they went off to dwell in the lodges of their husbands; but Oweenee was
deaf to all proposals of the kind. At last she married an old man
called Osseo, who was scarcely able to walk, and who was too poor to
have things like others. The only property he owned in the world was the
walking-staff which he carried in his hand. Though thus poor and homely,
Osseo was a devout and good man; faithful in all his duties, and
obedient in all things to the Good Spirit. Of course they jeered and
laughed at Oweenee on all sides, but she seemed to be quite happy, and
said to them, ""It is my choice and you will see in the end who has acted
the wisest."""
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,3,"They made a special mock of the walking-staff, and scarcely an hour in
the day passed that they had not some disparaging reference to it. Among
themselves they spoke of Osseo of the walking-staff, in derision, as the
owner of the big woods, or the great timber-man.

""True,"" said Oweenee, ""it is but a simple stick; but as it supports the
steps of my husband, it is more precious to me than all the forests of
the north.""

A time came when the sisters, and their husbands, and their parents were
all invited to a feast. As the distance was considerable, they doubted
whether Osseo, so aged and feeble, would be able to undertake the
journey; but in spite of their friendly doubts, he joined them, and set
out with a good heart."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,4,"As they walked along the path they could not help pitying their young
and handsome sister who had such an unsuitable mate. She, however,
smiled upon Osseo, and kept with him by the way the same as if he had
been the comeliest bridegroom in all the company. Osseo often stopped
and gazed upward; but they could perceive nothing in the direction in
which he looked, unless it was the faint glimmering of the evening star.
They heard him muttering to himself as they went along, and one of the
elder sisters caught the words, ""Pity me, my father!""

""Poor old man,"" said she; ""he is talking to his father. What a pity it
is that he would not fall and break his neck, that our sister might have
a young husband.""

Presently as they came to a great rock where Osseo had been used to
breathe his morning and his evening prayer, the star emitted a brighter
ray, which shone directly in his face."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,5,"Osseo, with a sharp cry, fell
trembling to the earth, where the others would have left him, but his
good wife raised him up, and he sprang forward on the path, and with
steps light as the reindeer he led the party, no longer decrepid and
infirm, but a beautiful young man. On turning around to look for his
wife, behold she had become changed, at the same moment, into an aged
and feeble woman, bent almost double, and walking with the staff which
he had cast aside.

Osseo immediately joined her, and with looks of fondness and the
tenderest regard, bestowed on her every endearing attention, and
constantly addressed her by the term of ne-ne-moosh-a, or my sweetheart.

As they walked along, whenever they were not gazing fondly in each
other's face, they bent their looks on heaven, and a light, as if of
far-off stars, was in their eyes."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,6,"On arriving at the lodge of the hunter with whom they were to feast,
they found the banquet ready, and as soon as their entertainer had
finished his harangue--in which he told them his feasting was in honor
of the Evening or Woman's Star--they began to partake of the portion
dealt out, according to age and character, to each one of the guests.
The food was very delicious, and they were all happy but Osseo, who
looked at his wife, and then gazed upward, as if he was looking into the
substance of the sky. Sounds were soon heard, as if from far-off voices
in the air, and they became plainer and plainer, till he could clearly
distinguish some of the words.

""My son, my son,"" said the voice; ""I have seen your afflictions, and
pity your wants. I come to call you away from a scene that is stained
with blood and tears. The earth is full of sorrows. Wicked spirits, the
enemies of mankind, walk abroad, and lie in wait to ensnare the children
of the sky. Every night they are lifting their voices to the Power of
Evil, and every day they make themselves busy in casting mischief in the
hunter's path."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,7,"You have long been their victim, but you shall be their
victim no more. The spell you were under is broken. Your evil genius is
overcome. I have cast him down by my superior strength, and it is this
strength I now exert for your happiness. Ascend, my son; ascend into the
skies, and partake of the feast I have prepared for you in the stars,
and bring with you those you love.

""The food set before you is enchanted and blessed. Fear not to partake
of it. It is endowed with magic power to give immortality to mortals,
and to change men to spirits. Your bowls and kettles shall no longer be
wood and earth. The one shall become silver, and the other pure gold.
They shall shine like fire, and glisten like the most beautiful scarlet.
Every female shall also change her state and looks, and no longer be
doomed to laborious tasks. She shall put on the beauty of the
star-light, and become a shining bird of the air. She shall dance, and
not work. She shall sing, and not cry."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,8,"""My beams,"" continued the voice, ""shine faintly on your lodge, but they
have power to transform it into the lightness of the skies, and decorate
it with the colors of the clouds. Come, Osseo, my son, and dwell no
longer on earth. Think strongly on my words, and look steadfastly at my
beams. My power is now at its height. Doubt not, delay not. It is the
voice of the Spirit of the Stars that calls you away to happiness and
celestial rest.""

The words were intelligible to Osseo, but his companions thought them
some far-off sounds of music, or birds singing in the woods. Very soon
the lodge began to shake and tremble, and they felt it rising into the
air. It was too late to run out, for they were already as high as the
tops of the trees. Osseo looked around him as the lodge passed through
the topmost boughs, and behold! their wooden dishes were changed into
shells of a scarlet color, the poles of the lodge to glittering rods of
silver, and the bark that covered them into the gorgeous wings of
insects."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,9,"A moment more and his brothers and sisters, and their parents and
friends, were transformed into birds of various plumage. Some were jays,
some partridges and pigeons, and others gay singing birds, who hopped
about, displaying their many-colored feathers, and singing songs of
cheerful note.

But his wife, Oweenee, still kept her earthly garb, and exhibited all
the indications of extreme old age. He again cast his eyes in the
direction of the clouds, and uttered the peculiar cry which had given
him the victory at the rock. In a moment the youth and beauty of his
wife returned; her dingy garments assumed the shining appearance of
green silk, and her staff was changed into a silver feather.

The lodge again shook and trembled, for they were now passing through
the uppermost clouds, and they immediately after found themselves in the
Evening Star, the residence of Osseo's father."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,10,"""My son,"" said the old man, ""hang that cage of birds which you have
brought along in your hand at the door, and I will inform you why you
and your wife have been sent for.""

Osseo obeyed, and then took his seat in the lodge.

""Pity was shown to you,"" resumed the King of the Star, ""on account of
the contempt of your wife's sister, who laughed at her ill fortune, and
ridiculed you while you were under the power of that wicked spirit whom
you overcame at the rock. That spirit lives in the next lodge, being the
small star you see on the left of mine, and he has always felt envious
of my family because we had greater power, and especially that we had
committed to us the care of the female world. He failed in many attempts
to destroy your brothers and sisters-in-law, but succeeded at last in
transforming yourself and your wife into decrepid old persons. You must
be careful and not let the light of his beams fall on you, while you are
here, for therein lies the power of his enchantment. A ray of light is
the bow and arrow he uses."""
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,11,"Osseo lived happy and contented in the parental lodge, and in due time
his wife presented him with a son, who grew up rapidly, and in the very
likeness of Osseo himself. He was very quick and ready in learning
every thing that was done in his grandfather's dominions, but he wished
also to learn the art of hunting, for he had heard that this was a
favorite pursuit below. To gratify him, his father made him a bow and
arrows, and he then let the birds out of the cage that he might practice
in shooting. In this pastime he soon became expert, and the very first
day he brought down a bird; but when he went to pick it up, to his
amazement it was a beautiful young woman, with the arrow sticking in her
breast. It was one of his younger aunts.

The moment her blood fell upon the surface of that pure and spotless
planet, the charm was dissolved. The boy immediately found himself
sinking, although he was partly upheld by something like wings until he
passed through the lower clouds, and he then suddenly dropped upon a
high, breezy island in a large lake. He was pleased, on looking up, to
see all his aunts and uncles following him in the form of birds, and he
soon discovered the silver lodge, with his father and mother,
descending, with its waving tassels fluttering like so many insects'
gilded wings."
osseo-the-son-of-the-evening-star,12,"It rested on the loftiest cliffs of the island, and there
they fixed their residence. They all resumed their natural shapes, but
they were diminished to the size of fairies; and as a mark of homage to
the King of the Evening Star, they never failed on every pleasant
evening during the summer season to join hands and dance upon the top of
the rocks. These rocks were quickly observed by the Indians to be
covered, in moonlight evenings, with a larger sort of Ininees, or little
men, and were called Mish-in-e-mok-in-ok-ong, or Little Spirits, and the
island is named from them to this day.

Their shining lodge can be seen in the summer evenings, when the moon
beams strongly on the pinnacles of the rocks; and the fishermen who go
near those high cliffs at night, have even heard the voices of the happy
little dancers. And Osseo and his wife, as fondly attached to each other
as ever, always lead the dance."
per-gynt,1,"In the old days there lived in Kvam a marksman by the name of Per Gynt.
He was continually in the mountains, where he shot bear and elk. At
that time there were more forests on the Fjoll, and all sorts of beasts
dwelt in them. Once, late in the fall, when the cattle had long since
been driven down from the mountain pastures, Per Gynt decided to go up
on the Fjoll again. With the exception of three dairy-maids, all the
herd-folk had already left the mountains. But when Per Gynt reached
Hovringalm, where he intended to stay over-night in a herdsman's hut,
it already was so dark that he could not see his hand before his eyes.
Then the dogs began to bark so violently that he felt quite uneasy. And
suddenly his foot struck something. When he took hold of it, it was
cold, and large and slippery. Since he felt certain he had not left the
path, he could not imagine what it might be; but he sensed that all was
not in order."
per-gynt,2,"""And who are you?"" asked Per Gynt, for he noticed that it moved.

""O, I am the crooked one,"" was the answer. And now Per Gynt knew as much
as he had before. So he went along its length, ""for sooner or later I
will come to the end of it,"" thought he.

As he went along he again struck against something, and when he felt it,
it was again something cold, and large and slippery.

""And who are you?"" asked Per Gynt.

""I am the crooked one,"" was again the answer."
per-gynt,3,"""Well, whether you be crooked or straight, you will have to let me
pass,"" said Per Gynt. He noticed that he was going around in a
circle, and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman's
cottage. At these words the crooked one moved a little to one side, so
that Per Gynt could get into the cottage. When he entered he found it as
dark inside as it was out. He stumbled and felt his way along the
walls. He wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. But
while he was feeling his way about, he once more noticed the something
large, and cold and slippery.

""And who are you now?"" cried Per Gynt.

""O, I am the big crooked one,"" was the answer. And no matter where he
took hold or where he set his foot, he could feel the coils of the
crooked one laid around him.

""This is a poor place to be in,"" thought Per Gynt, ""for this crooked one
is outside and inside. I will soon put what is wrong to rights."" He
took his firelock, went out again, and felt his way along the crooked
one until he came to his head."
per-gynt,4,"""And who are you really and truly?"" he asked.

""O, I am the big crooked one of Etnedal,"" said the monster troll. Then
Per Gynt did not waste any time, but shot three bullets right through
the middle of his head.

""Shoot again!"" cried the crooked one. But Per Gynt knew better, for had
he shot another time, the bullet would have rebounded and hit him. When
this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll,
and dragged him out of the hut, so that they might make themselves
comfortable there. And meanwhile the hills about rang with laughter and
jeers. ""Per Gynt pulled hard, but the dogs pulled harder!"" rang in his
ears."
per-gynt,5,"In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting. When he had made his way
far into the Fjoll, he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a
mountain-top. But when he reached the top of the mountain, the girl
had vanished, as well as her flock, and all he saw was a great pack
of bears.

""Never yet have I seen bears run together in packs,"" thought Per Gynt.
But when he came nearer, they all disappeared save one alone. Then a
voice called from a nearby hill:

      ""Guard your boar, for understand,
      Per Gynt is without,
      With his firelock in his hand!"""
per-gynt,6,"""O, then it is the worse for Per Gynt; but not for my boar, because Per
Gynt did not wash to-day,"" sounded back from the hill. But Per Gynt spat
on his hands, and washed them thus, and then shot the bear.

The hills rang with echoing laughter:

""You should have guarded your boar better,"" called one voice.

""I did not think he carried the wash-bowl in his mouth,"" answered the
other.

Per Gynt skinned the bear, and buried his body among the bowlders; but
the head and skin he took with him. On the way back he met a mountain
fox.

""See, my little lamb, how fat you are!"" rang out from one hill. ""Just
see how high Per Gynt carries his firelock!"" sounded from another, as
Per Gynt shouldered his firelock and shot the fox. He also skinned,
and took the skin with him. When he reached the herdsman's hut, he
nailed the heads, with jaws wide open, against the outer wall. Then he
made a fire and hung a soup kettle over it. It smoked so terribly he
could hardly keep his eyes open, and therefore had to make a loop-hole.
Suddenly up came a troll, and thrust his nose through the loop-hole; but
his nose was so long that it reached the fireplace."
per-gynt,7,"""Here is my smeller, so take a good look!"" said he.

""Here is a taste of the soup that I cook!"" said Per Gynt, and he
poured the whole kettleful of soup over his nose. The troll rushed off
lamenting loudly. From all the heights around came laughter and
derision and calls of:

""Gyri Soupsmeller, Gyri Soupsmeller!""

Thereupon all was quiet for a time. Before very long the noise and
tumult outside began again. Per Gynt looked out, and saw a wagon drawn
by bears. The great troll was loaded upon it, and off they went with
him up the Fjoll. Suddenly a pail of water was poured down through
the chimney, smothering the fire, and Per Gynt sat in the dark. Then
laughter and jibes came from every corner, and one voice said: ""Now Per
Gynt will be no better off than the dairy-maids in the hut at Val!"""
per-gynt,8,"Per Gynt once more lit the fire, called his dogs and locked the herdsman's
hut. He went on North, toward the hut at Val, in which there were three
dairy-maids. After he had covered some distance he saw a fire, as though
the whole hut were ablaze. At the same moment he came across a whole
pack of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death.
When he reached the hut at Val, he found it pitch dark there, and there
was no fire to be seen, far or near. But there were four strangers in
the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids. They were four mountain
trolls, and their names were: Gust i Vore, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjostol
Aabakken, and Rolf Eldforkungen. Gust i Vore stood at the door, on
guard, and Per Gynt shot at him, but missed, so he ran away. When Per
Gynt entered the room the dairy-maids were well-nigh frightened to
death; but when the trolls saw who had come they began to wail, and
told Eldforkungen to make a fire. At the same moment the dogs sprang
upon Kjostol Aabakken, and threw him head over heels into the hearth,
so that the ashes and sparks flew about."
per-gynt,9,"""Have you seen my snakes, Per Gynt?"" asked Tron Valfjeldet--for that was
what he called the wolves.

""Yes, and now you shall travel the same road your snakes have gone!""
cried Per Gynt, and shot him. Then he made an end of Aabakken with the
butt-end of his firelock; but Eldforkungen had fled through the chimney.
After Per Gynt had done this, he accompanied the dairy-maids back to
their village, for they did not venture to stay in the hut any longer.

When Christmas came, Per Gynt once more got under way. He had heard of
a farmstead at Dovre, where so many trolls were accustomed to congregate
on Christmas Eve. The people who lived there had to flee, and find
places to stay at other farms. This farmstead Per Gynt decided to hunt
up. He thought he would like to see these trolls. He put on torn
clothing, and took with him a tame bear which belonged to him, together
with an awl, some pitch and some wire. When he had reached the
farmstead, he went into the house and asked for shelter."
per-gynt,10,"""May God aid us!"" cried the man. ""We cannot shelter you, and have to
leave the house ourselves, because the place is alive with trolls every
Christmas Eve!""

But Per Gynt thought he could manage to clear the house of the trolls.
So they told him to stay, and gave him a pig's skin into the bargain.
Then the bear lay down behind the hearth, Per took out his awl, his
pitch and his wire, and set out to make a single large shoe out of the
pig's skin. And he drew a thick rope through it for a lace, so that he
could lace the whole shoe together, and besides he had two wagon-spokes
for wedges at hand. Suddenly the trolls came along with fiddles and
fiddlers, and some of them danced, and others ate of the Christmas
dinner that stood on the table, and some fried bacon, and others fried
frogs and toads and disgusting things of that kind--the Christmas dinner
they had brought along themselves. In the meantime some of them noticed
the shoe Per Gynt had made. Since it was evidently intended for a large
foot, all the trolls wanted to try it on. When every one of them had
thrust in his foot, Per Gynt laced it, forced in a wedge, and then drew
the lace so taut that every last one of them was caught and held in the
shoe. But now the bear thrust forth his nose, and sniffed the roast."
per-gynt,11,"""Would you like to have some cake, little white cat?"" said one of the
trolls, and threw a burning hot, roasted frog into the bear's jaws.

""Thump them, Master Bruin!"" cried Per Gynt. And the bear grew so angry
that he rushed on the trolls, raining blows on every side and scratching
them. And Per Gynt hewed into the crowd with his other wagon-spoke as
though he meant to break their skulls. Then the trolls had to make
themselves scarce, but Per Gynt remained, and feasted on the Christmas
fare all of Christmas week, while for many a long year no more was heard
of the trolls."
pinkel-thief,1,"Long, long ago there lived a widow who had three sons. The two eldest were grown up, and though they were known to be idle fellows, some of the neighbours had given them work to do on account of the respect in which their mother was held. But at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer. So home they went to their mother and youngest brother, of whom they thought little, because he made himself useful about the house, and looked after the hens, and milked the cow. 'Pinkel,' they called him in scorn, and by-and-by 'Pinkel' became his name throughout the village."
pinkel-thief,2,"The two young men thought it was much nicer to live at home and be idle than to be obliged to do a quantity of disagreeable things they did not like, and they would have stayed by the fire till the end of their lives had not the widow lost patience with them and said that since they would not look for work at home they must seek it elsewhere, for she would not have them under her roof any longer. But she repented bitterly of her words when Pinkel told her that he too was old enough to go out into the world, and that when he had made a fortune he would send for his mother to keep house for him. The widow wept many tears at parting from her youngest son, but as she saw that his heart was set upon going with his brothers, she did not try to keep him. So the young men started off one morning in high spirits, never doubting that work such as they might be willing to do would be had for the asking, as soon as their little store of money was spent."
pinkel-thief,3,"But a very few days of wandering opened their eyes. Nobody seemed to want them, or, if they did, the young men declared that they were not able to undertake all that the farmers or millers or woodcutters required of them. The youngest brother, who was wiser, would gladly have done some of the work that the others refused, but he was small and slight, and no one thought of offering him any. Therefore they went from one place to another, living only on the fruit and nuts they could find in the woods, and getting hungrier every day. One night, after they had been walking for many hours and were very tired, they came to a large lake with an island in the middle of it. From the island streamed a strong light, by which they could see everything almost as clearly as if the sun had been shining, and they perceived that, lying half hidden in the rushes, was a boat."
pinkel-thief,4,"'Let us take it and row over to the island, where there must be a house,' said the eldest brother; 'and perhaps they will give us food and shelter.' And they all got in and rowed across in the direction of the light. As they drew near the island they saw that it came from a golden lantern hanging over the door of a hut, while sweet tinkling music proceeded from some bells attached to the golden horns of a goat which was feeding near the cottage. The young men's hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs, and they entered the hut, but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside, wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house. They looked at each other uneasily as she came forward with her daughter, as they knew by the cloak that this was a famous witch."
pinkel-thief,5,"'What do you want?' asked she, at the same time signing to her daughter to stir the large pot on the fire.

'We are tired and hungry, and would fain have shelter for the night,' answered the eldest brother.

'You cannot get it here,' said the witch, 'but you will find both food and shelter in the palace on the other side of the lake. Take your boat and go; but leave this boy with me-I can find work for him, though something tells me he is quick and cunning, and will do me ill.'

'What harm can a poor boy like me do a great Troll like you?' answered Pinkel. 'Let me go, I pray you, with my brothers. I will promise never to hurt you.' And at last the witch let him go, and he followed his brothers to the boat."
pinkel-thief,6,"The way was further than they thought, and it was morning before they reached the palace.

Now, at last, their luck seemed to have turned, for while the two eldest were given places in the king's stables, Pinkel was taken as page to the little prince. He was a clever and amusing boy, who saw everything that passed under his eyes, and the king noticed this, and often employed him in his own service, which made his brothers very jealous."
pinkel-thief,7,"Things went on this way for some time, and Pinkel every day rose in the royal favour. At length the envy of his brothers became so great that they could bear it no longer, and consulted together how best they might ruin his credit with the king. They did not wish to kill him-though, perhaps, they would not have been sorry if they had heard he was dead-but merely wished to remind him that he was after all only a child, not half so old and wise as they."
pinkel-thief,8,"Their opportunity soon came. It happened to be the king's custom to visit his stables once a week, so that he might see that his horses were being properly cared for. The next time he entered the stables the two brothers managed to be in the way, and when the king praised the beautiful satin skins of the horses under their charge, and remarked how different was their condition when his grooms had first come across the lake, the young men at once began to speak of the wonderful light which sprang from the lantern over the hut. The king, who had a passion for collection all the rarest things he could find, fell into the trap directly, and inquired where he could get this marvellous lantern."
pinkel-thief,9,"'Send Pinkel for it, Sire,' said they. 'It belongs to an old witch, who no doubt came by it in some evil way. But Pinkel has a smooth tongue, and he can get the better of any woman, old or young.'

'Then bid him go this very night,' cried the king; 'and if he brings me the lantern I will make him one of the chief men about my person.'"
pinkel-thief,10,"Pinkel was much pleased at the thought of his adventure, and without more ado he borrowed a little boat which lay moored to the shore, and rowed over to the island at once. It was late by the time he arrived, and almost dark, but he knew by the savoury smell that reached him that the witch was cooking her supper. So he climbed softly on to the roof, and, peering, watched till the old woman's back was turned, when he quickly drew a handful of salt from his pocket and threw it into the pot. Scarcely had he done this when the witch called her daughter and bade her lift the pot off the fire and put the stew into a dish, as it had been cooking quite long enough and she was hungry. But no sooner had she tasted it than she put her spoon down, and declared that her daughter must have been meddling with it, for it was impossible to eat anything that was all made of salt."
pinkel-thief,11,"'Go down to the spring in the valley, and get some fresh water, that I may prepare a fresh supper,' cried she, 'for I feel half-starved.'

'But, mother,' answered the girl, 'how can I find the well in this darkness? For you know that the lantern's rays shed no light down there.'

'Well, then, take the lantern with you,' answered the witch, 'for supper I must have, and there is no water that is nearer.'

So the girl took her pail in one hand and the golden lantern in the other, and hastened away to the well, followed by Pinkel, who took care to keep out of the way of the rays. When at last she stooped to fill her pail at the well Pinkel pushed her into it, and snatching up the lantern hurried back to his boat and rowed off from the shore."
pinkel-thief,12,"He was already a long distance from the island when the witch, who wondered what had become of her daughter, went to the door to look for her. Close around the hut was thick darkness, but what was that bobbing light that streamed across the water? The witch's heart sank as all at once it flashed upon her what had happened.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' cried she; and the youth answered:

'Yes, dear mother, it is I!'

'And are you not a knave for robbing me?' said she.

'Truly, dear mother, I am,' replied Pinkel, rowing faster than ever, for he was half afraid that the witch might come after him. But she had no power on the water, and turned angrily into the hut, muttering to herself all the while:

'Take care! take care! A second time you will not escape so easily!'"
pinkel-thief,13,"The sun had not yet risen when Pinkel returned to the palace, and, entering the king's chamber, he held up the lantern so that its rays might fall upon the bed. In an instant the king awoke, and seeing the golden lantern shedding its light upon him, he sprang up, and embraced Pinkel with joy.

'O cunning one,' cried he, 'what treasure hast thou brought me!' And calling for his attendants he ordered that rooms next his own should be prepared for Pinkel, and that the youth might enter his presence at any hour. And besides this, he was to have a seat on the council."
pinkel-thief,14,"It may easily be guessed that all this made the brothers more envious than they were before; and they cast about in their minds afresh how best they might destroy him. At length they remembered the goat with golden horns and the bells, and they rejoiced; 'For,' said they, 'THIS time the old woman will be on the watch, and let him be as clever as he likes, the bells on the horns are sure to warn her.' So when, as before, the king came down to the stables and praised the cleverness of their brother, the young men told him of that other marvel possessed by the witch, the goat with the golden horns.

From this moment the king never closed his eyes at night for longing after this wonderful creature. He understood something of the danger that there might be in trying to steal it, now that the witch's suspicions were aroused, and he spent hours in making plans for outwitting her. But somehow he never could think of anything that would do, and at last, as the brothers had foreseen, he sent for Pinkel."
pinkel-thief,15,"'I hear,' he said, 'that the old witch on the island has a goat with golden horns from which hang bells that tinkle the sweetest music. That goat I must have! But, tell me, how am I to get it? I would give the third part of my kingdom to anyone who would bring it to me.'

'I will fetch it myself,' answered Pinkel.

This time it was easier for Pinkel to approach the island unseen, as there was no golden lantern to thrown its beams over the water. But, on the other hand, the goat slept inside the hut, and would therefore have to be taken from under the very eyes of the old woman. How was he to do it? All the way across the lake he thought and thought, till at length a plan came into his head which seemed as if it might do, though he knew it would be very difficult to carry out."
pinkel-thief,16,"The first thing he did when he reached the shore was to look about for a piece of wood, and when he had found it he hid himself close to the hut, till it grew quite dark and near the hour when the witch and her daughter went to bed. Then he crept up and fixed the wood under the door, which opened outwards, in such a manner that the more you tried to shut it the more firmly it stuck. And this was what happened when the girl went as usual to bolt the door and make all fast for the night.

'What are you doing?' asked the witch, as her daughter kept tugging at the handle.

'There is something the matter with the door; it won't shut,' answered she."
pinkel-thief,17,"'Well, leave it alone; there is nobody to hurt us,' said the witch, who was very sleepy; and the girl did as she was bid, and went to bed. Very soon they both might have been heard snoring, and Pinkel knew that his time was come. Slipping off his shoes he stole into the hut on tiptoe, and taking from his pocket some food of which the goat was particularly fond, he laid it under his nose. Then, while the animal was eating it, he stuffed each golden bell with wool which he had also brought with him, stopping every minute to listen, lest the witch should awaken, and he should find himself changed into some dreadful bird or beast. But the snoring still continued, and he went on with his work as quickly as he could. When the last bell was done he drew another handful of food out of his pocket, and held it out to the goat, which instantly rose to its feet and followed Pinkel, who backed slowly to the door, and directly he got outside he seized the goat in his arms and ran down to the place where he had moored his boat."
pinkel-thief,18,"As soon as he had reached the middle of the lake, Pinkel took the wool out of the bells, which began to tinkle loudly. Their sound awoke the witch, who cried out as before:

'Is that you, Pinkel?'

'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' said Pinkel.

'Have you stolen my golden goat?' asked she.

'Yes, dear mother, I have,' answered Pinkel.

'Are you not a knave, Pinkel?'

'Yes, dear mother, I am,' he replied. And the old witch shouted in a rage:

'Ah! beware how you come hither again, for next time you shall not escape me!'

But Pinkel laughed and rowed on.

The king was so delighted with the goat that he always kept it by his side, night and day; and, as he had promised, Pinkel was made ruler over the third part of the kingdom. As may be supposed, the brothers were more furious than ever, and grew quite thin with rage."
pinkel-thief,19,"'How can we get rid of him?' said one to the other. And at length they remembered the golden cloak.

'He will need to be clever if he is to steal that!' they cried, with a chuckle. And when next the king came to see his horses they began to speak of Pinkel and his marvellous cunning, and how he had contrived to steal the lantern and the goat, which nobody else would have been able to do.

'But as he was there, it is a pity he could not have brought away the golden cloak,' added they.

'The golden cloak! what is that?' asked the king. And the young men described its beauties in such glowing words that the king declared he should never know a day's happiness till he had wrapped the cloak round his own shoulders.

'And,' added he, 'the man who brings it to me shall wed my daughter, and shall inherit my throne.'

'None can get it save Pinkel,' said they; for they did not imagine that the witch, after two warnings, could allow their brother to escape a third time. So Pinkel was sent for, and with a glad heart he set out."
pinkel-thief,20,"He passed many hours inventing first one plan and then another, till he had a scheme ready which he thought might prove successful.

Thrusting a large bag inside his coat, he pushed off from the shore, taking care this time to reach the island in daylight. Having made his boat fast to a tree, he walked up to the hut, hanging his head, and putting on a face that was both sorrowful and ashamed.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' asked the witch when she saw him, her eyes gleaming savagely.

'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' answered Pinkel.

'So you have dared, after all you have done, to put yourself in my power!' cried she. 'Well, you sha'n't escape me THIS time!' And she took down a large knife and began to sharpen it.

'Oh! dear mother, spare me!' shrieked Pinkel, falling on his knees, and looking wildly about him."
pinkel-thief,21,"'Spare you, indeed, you thief! Where are my lantern and my goat? No! not! there is only one fate for robbers!' And she brandished the knife in the air so that it glittered in the firelight.

'Then, if I must die,' said Pinkel, who, by this time, was getting really rather frightened, 'let me at least choose the manner of my death. I am very hungry, for I have had nothing to eat all day. Put some poison, if you like, into the porridge, but at least let me have a good meal before I die.'

'That is not a bad idea,' answered the woman; 'as long as you do die, it is all one to me.' And ladling out a large bowl of porridge, she stirred some poisonous herbs into it, and set about work that had to be done. Then Pinkel hastily poured all the contents of the bowl into his bag, and make a great noise with his spoon, as if he was scraping up the last morsel.

'Poisoned or not, the porridge is excellent. I have eaten it, every scrap; do give me some more,' said Pinkel, turning towards her."
pinkel-thief,22,"'Well, you have a fine appetite, young man,' answered the witch; 'however, it is the last time you will ever eat it, so I will give you another bowlful.' And rubbing in the poisonous herbs, she poured him out half of what remained, and then went to the window to call her cat.

In an instant Pinkel again emptied the porridge into the bag, and the next minute he rolled on the floor, twisting himself about as if in agony, uttering loud groans the while. Suddenly he grew silent and lay still."
pinkel-thief,23,"'Ah! I thought a second dose of that poison would be too much for you,' said the witch looking at him. 'I warned you what would happen if you came back. I wish that all thieves were as dead as you! But why does not my lazy girl bring the wood I sent her for, it will soon be too dark for her to find her way? I suppose I must go and search for her. What a trouble girls are!' And she went to the door to watch if there were any signs of her daughter. But nothing could be seen of her, and heavy rain was falling.

'It is no night for my cloak,' she muttered; 'it would be covered with mud by the time I got back.' So she took it off her shoulders and hung it carefully up in a cupboard in the room. After that she put on her clogs and started to seek her daughter. Directly the last sound of the clogs had ceased, Pinkel jumped up and took down the cloak, and rowed off as fast as he could."
pinkel-thief,24,"He had not gone far when a puff of wind unfolded the cloak, and its brightness shed gleams across the water. The witch, who was just entering the forest, turned round at that moment and saw the golden rays. She forgot all about her daughter, and ran down to the shore, screaming with rage at being outwitted a third time.

'Is that you, Pinkel?' cried she.

'Yes, dear mother, it is I.'

'Have you taken my gold cloak?'

'Yes, dear mother, I have.'

'Are you not a great knave?'

'Yes, truly dear mother, I am.'

And so indeed he was!"
pinkel-thief,25,"But, all the same, he carried the cloak to the king's palace, and in return he received the hand of the king's daughter in marriage. People said that it was the bride who ought to have worn the cloak at her wedding feast; but the king was so pleased with it that he would not part from it; and to the end of his life was never seen without it. After his death, Pinkel became king; and let up hope that he gave up his bad and thievish ways, and ruled his subjects well. As for his brothers, he did not punish them, but left them in the stables, where they grumbled all day long."
princess-bella-flor,1,"Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons. When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country, and for many years no one heard anything about him. Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father, who died at last in a good old age, leaving great riches behind him.

For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father's wealth freely, believing that he alone remained to enjoy it. But, one day, as he was coming down stairs, he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall, looking about as if the house belonged to him."
princess-bella-flor,2,"'Have you forgotten me?' asked the man.

'I can't forget a person I have never known,' was the rude answer.

'I am your brother,' replied the stranger, 'and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made. And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead. I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more.'

'He died six months ago,' said the rich brother, 'and he left you, as your portion, the old wooden chest that stands in the loft. You had better go there and look for it; I have no more time to waste.' And he went his way."
princess-bella-flor,3,"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft, which was at the top of the storehouse, and there he found the wooden chest, so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces.

'What use is this old thing to me?' he said to himself. 'Oh, well, it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself; so things might be worse after all.'

Placing the chest on his back, the man, whose name was Jose, set out for his inn, and, borrowing a hatchet, began to chop up the box. In doing so he discovered a secret drawer, and in it lay a paper. He opened the paper, not knowing what it might contain, and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father. Putting the precious writing in his pocket, he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside, and he ran out at once in search of him."
princess-bella-flor,4,"The debtor proved to be an old miser, who lived at the other end of the village. He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed, and, indeed, when he saw it, was very unwilling to pay what he owed. However, the stranger threatened to drag him before the king, and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one. The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket, and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man.

A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town, when he met a poor woman crying bitterly. He stopped and asked her what was the matter, and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying, and, to make matters worse, a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison."
princess-bella-flor,5,"'Comfort yourself,' said the stranger kindly; 'they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods. I will not only pay his debts but, if he dies, the cost of his burial also. And now go home, and nurse him as well as you can.'

And so she did; but, in spite of her care, the husband died, and was buried by the stranger. But everything cost more than he expected, and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left.

'What am I to do now?' said he to himself. 'I think I had better go to court, and enter into the service of the king.'"
princess-bella-flor,6,"At first he was only a servant, who carried the king the water for his bath, and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion. But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him, and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber.

Now, when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited, and did not know how to make any for himself. He then bethought him of the king's favourite, and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother, whom he had so ill-used, would give him his protection, and find him a place. The elder, who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf, and the next day the young man took up is work at court."
princess-bella-flor,7,"Unfortunately, the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious, and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself. By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors, he learned that the king, old and ugly though he was, had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor, who would have nothing to say to him, and had hidden herself in some mountain castle, no one knew where.

'That will do nicely,' thought the scoundrel, rubbing his hands. 'It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her, and if he returns without finding her, his head will be the forfeit. Either way, he will be out of MY path.'

So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king, to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance. The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay, and bade him state what he had to say, and to be quick about it."
princess-bella-flor,8,"'Oh, sire! the Princess Bella-Flor-' answered the man, and then stopped as if afraid.

'What of the Princess Bella-Flor?' asked the king impatiently.

'I have heard-it is whispered at court-that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding.'

'I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me,' cried the king, eagerly. 'Speak on, knave; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret?'

'It is not I, but my brother, who knows,' replied the traitor; 'if your majesty would ask him-' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall.

'Order Jose to appear before me instantly,' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders, so great was the noise his majesty had made; and when Jose entered the hall, wondering what in the world could be the matter, the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement.

'Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment,' stammered he, 'for if you return without her I will have you drowned!' And without another word he left the hall, leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror.

'How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her?' thought he. 'But it is no use staying here, for I shall only be put to death.' And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse."
princess-bella-flor,9,"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls, and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other, wondering which he should choose, when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach.

'Take me,' it said in a gentle whisper, 'and all will go well.'

Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk. Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable. He was about to mount on his back, when the animal spoke again:

'Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there, and put them in your pocket.'

Jose did as he was told, and being in a great hurry to get away, asked no questions, but swung himself into the saddle."
princess-bella-flor,10,"They rode far without meeting any adventures, but at length they came to an ant-hill, and the horse stopped.

'Crumble those three loaves for the ants,' he said. But Jose hesitated.

'Why, we may want them ourselves!' answered he.

'Never mind that; give them to the ants all the same. Do not lose a chance of helping others.' And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road, the horse galloped on.

By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains, and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter's net.

'Get down and cut the meshes of the net, and set the poor bird free,' said the horse.

'But it will take so long,' objected Jose, 'and we may miss the princess.'

'Never mind that; do not lose a chance of helping others,' answered the horse. And when the meshes were cut, and the eagle was free, the horse galloped on."
princess-bella-flor,11,"The had ridden many miles, and at last they came to a river, where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand, and the horse said:

'Do you see that little fish? It will die if you do not put it back in the water.'

'But, really, we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this!' cried Jose.

'We never waste time when we are helping others,' answered the horse. And soon the little fish was swimming happily away.

A little while after they reached a castle, which was built in the middle of a very thick wood, and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens.

'Now listen,' said the horse. 'I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips, which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor. Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way, and you must help her to mount. When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick, and you must say that I have never carried a woman before, and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me. Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king's palace.'"
princess-bella-flor,12,"Jose did exactly as the horse told him, and everything fell out as the animal prophesied; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive. She said nothing, however, but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens, and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground.

'Oh, I have let fall my bran!' cried she; 'please get down and pick it up for me.' But Jose only answered:

'We shall find plenty of bran where we are going.' And the horse galloped on.

They were now passing through a forest, and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards, so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree.

'Dear me; how stupid! I have let my handkerchief blow away,' said she. 'Will you climb up and get it for me?' But Jose answered:

'We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going.' And the horse galloped on.

After the wood they reached a river, and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water.

'How careless of me,' gasped she, beginning to sob. 'I have lost my favourite ring; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it.' But Jose answered:

'You will find plenty of rings where you are going.' And the horse galloped on."
princess-bella-flor,13,"At last they entered the palace gates, and the king's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor. But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly, and locked herself into the nearest room, which she would not open for all his entreaties.

'Bring me the three things I lost on the way, and perhaps I may think about it,' was all she would say. And, in despair, the king was driven to take counsel of Jose.

'There is no remedy that I can see,' said his majesty, 'but that you, who know where they are, should go and bring them back. And if you return without them I will have you drowned.'"
princess-bella-flor,14,"Poor Jose was much troubled at these words. He thought that he had done all that was required of him, and that his life was safe. However, he bowed low, and went out to consult his friend the horse.

'Do not vex yourself,' said the horse, when he had heard the story; 'jump up, and we will go and look for the things.' And Jose mounted at once.

They rode on till they came to the ant-hill, and then the horse asked:

'Would you like to have the bran?'

'What is the use of liking?' answered Jose.

'Well, call the ants, and tell them to fetch it for you; and, if some of it has been scattered by the wind, to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them.' Jose listened in surprise. He did not much believe in the horse's plan; but he could not think of anything better, so he called to the ants, and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could."
princess-bella-flor,15,"Then he saw under a tree and waited, while his horse cropped the green turf.

'Look there!' said the animal, suddenly raising its head; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran, which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle.

'Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later,' observed the horse; 'but mount again, as we have far to go.'

When they arrived at the tree, they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch, and Jose's spirits sank again.

'How am I to get that handkerchief?' cried he; 'why I should need Jacob's ladder!' But the horse answered:

'Do not be frightened; call to the eagle you set free from the net, he will bring it to you.'

So Jose called to the eagle, and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak. Jose thanked him, and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river.

A great deal of rain had fallen in the night, and the river, instead of being clear as it was before, was dark and troubled."
princess-bella-flor,16,"'How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped, and cannot even see it?' asked Jose. But the horse answered: 'Do not be frightened; call the little fish whose life you saved, and she will bring it to you.'

So he called to the fish, and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones, and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring, and brought it to Jose in its mouth.

Well pleased with all he had done, Jose returned to the palace; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor, she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil.

'I am very sorry,' said the king to Jose, 'I really would rather not; but you see I have no choice.'

While the oil was being heated in the great caldron, Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape."
princess-bella-flor,17,"'Do not be frightened,' said the horse. 'Get on my back, and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration, then rub it all over your skin, and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it.'

Jose did not ask any more questions, but did as the horse bade him; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil. He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough. Then out came a youth so young and handsome, that everyone fell in love with him, and Bella-Flor most of all.

As for the old king, he saw that he had lost the game; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron, and was fried instead of Jose. Then Jose was proclaimed king, on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day. But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse, and said to him: 'It is to you that I owe my life and my crown. Why have you done all this for me?'

And the horse answered: 'I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune. And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you, as you had helped me. For, as I told you, Good deeds bear their own fruit!'"
prudent-hans,1,"ONE day, Hans's mother said, ""Where are you going, Hans?"" 
Hans answered, ""To Grethel's, mother."" 
""Manage well, Hans."" 
""All right! Good-bye, mother.""

So Grethel gave Hans a needle; and then he said, ""Good-bye, Grethel,"" and she said, ""Good-bye, Hans.""  Hans carried the needle away with him, and stuck it in a hay-cart that was going along, and he followed it home.

So Grethel gave Hans a piece of bacon. Then he said, ""Good-bye, Grethel."" 
She said, ""Good-bye, Hans."" 
Hans took the bacon, and tied a string round it, and dragged it after him on his way home, and the dogs came and ate it up, so that when he got home he had the string in his hand, and nothing at the other end of it.

puppet-show-man,1,"On board a steamer I once met an elderly man, with such a merry face that, if it was really an index of his mind, he must have been the happiest fellow in creation. indeed he considered himself so, for I heard it from his own mouth. He was a Dane, the owner of a travelling theatre. He had all his company with him in a large box, for he was the proprietor of a puppet-show. His inborn cheerfulness, he said, had been tested by a member of the Polytechnic Institution, and the experiment had made him completely happy. I did not at first understand all this, but afterwards he explained the whole story to me. Here it is:--"
puppet-show-man,2,"""I was giving a representation,"" he said, ""in the hall of the posting-house in the little town of Slagelse. There was a splendid audience, entirely juvenile excepting two respectable matrons. All at once, a person in black, of student-like appearance, entered the room, and sat down. He laughed aloud at the telling points, and applauded quite at the proper time. This was a very unusual spectator for me, and I felt anxious to know who he was. I heard that he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in Copenhagen, who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces. Punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed, for children must go early to bed, and a manager must also consult the convenience of the public."
puppet-show-man,3,"""At nine o'clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and his experiments, and then I formed a part of his audience. It was wonderful both to hear and to see. The greater part of it was beyond my comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can acquire so much, we must surely be intended to last longer than the little span which extends only to the time when we are hidden away under the earth. His experiments were quite miracles on a small scale, and yet the explanations flowed as naturally as water from his lips. At the time of Moses and the prophets, such a man would have been placed among the sages of the land; in the middle ages they would have burnt him at the stake."
puppet-show-man,4,"""All night long I could not sleep. The next evening when I gave another performance and the lecturer was present, I was in one of my best moods. ""I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the part of a lover, always thought of one particular lady in the audience. He only played for her, and forgot all the rest of the house, and now the Polytechnic lecturer was my she, my only auditor, for whom alone I played."
puppet-show-man,5,"""When the performance was over, and the puppets removed behind the curtain, the Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his room to take a glass of wine. He talked of my comedies, and I of his science, and I believe we were both equally pleased. But I had the best of it, for there was much in what he did that he could not always explain to me. For instance, why a piece of iron which is rubbed on a cylinder, should become magnetic. How does this happen? The magnetic sparks come to it,--but how? It is the same with people in the world; they are rubbed about on this spherical globe till the electric spark comes upon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or a Luther, or some one of the kind."
puppet-show-man,6,"""'The whole world is but a series of miracles,' said the lecturer, 'but we are so accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters.' And he went on explaining things to me till my skull seemed lifted from my brain. I declared that were I not such an old fellow, I would at once become a member of the Polytechnic Institution, that I might learn to look at the bright side of everything, although I was one of the happiest of men.  ""'One of the happiest!' said the lecturer, as if the idea pleased him. 'Are you really happy?'  ""'Yes,' I replied; 'for I am welcomed in every town, when I arrive with my company. But I certainly have one wish which sometimes weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead. I should like to become the manager of a real theatre, and the director of a real troupe of men and women.'  ""'I understand,' he said; 'you would like to have life breathed into your puppets, so that they might be living actors, and you their director. And would you then be quite happy?'"
puppet-show-man,7,"""I said I believed so. But he did not. We talked it over in all manner of ways, yet could not agree on the subject. However, the wine was excellent, and we clanked our glasses together as we drank. There must have been magic in it, or I should most certainly become tipsy. But that did not happen, for my mind seemed quite clear. Indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the room, and beamed from the eyes of the Polytechnic lecturer. It made me think of the old stories when the gods, in their immortal youth, wandered upon this earth, and paid visits to mankind. I said so to him, and he smiled. I could have sworn that he was one of these ancient deities in disguise, or, at all events, that he belonged to the race of the gods. The result seemed to prove I was right in my suspicions. For it was arranged that my highest wish should be granted, that my puppets were to be gifted with life. I was to be the manager of a real company. We drank to my success, and clanked our glasses."
puppet-show-man,8,"Then he packed all my dolls into the box, and fastened it on my back, and I felt as if I were spinning round in a circle. I presently found myself lying on the floor. I remember that quite well. And then the whole company sprang from the box. The spirit had come upon us all. The puppets had become distinguished actors--at least, so they said themselves--and I was their director."
puppet-show-man,9,"""When all was ready for the first representation, the whole company requested permission to speak to me before appearing in public. The dancing lady said the house could not be supported unless she stood on one leg. For she was a great genius, and begged to be treated as such. The lady who acted the part of the queen expected to be treated as a queen off the stage, as well as on it, or else she said she should get out of practice. The man whose duty it was to deliver a letter gave himself as many airs as he who took the part of first lover in the piece. He declared that the inferior parts were as important as the great ones, and deserving equal consideration, as parts of an artistic whole."
puppet-show-man,10,"The hero of the piece would only play in a part containing points likely to bring down the applause of the house. The 'prima donna' would only act when the lights were red, for she declared that a blue light did not suit her complexion. It was like a company of flies in a bottle, and I was in the bottle with them. I was their director. My breath was taken away, my head whirled, and I was as miserable as a man could be. It was quite a novel, strange set of beings among whom I now found myself. I only wished I had them all in my box again, and that I had never been their director. So I told them roundly that, after all, they were nothing but puppets; and then they killed me."
puppet-show-man,11,"After a while I found myself lying on my bed in my room; but how I got there, or how I got away at all from the Polytechnic professor, he may perhaps know, I don't. The moon shone upon the floor, the box lay open, and the dolls were all scattered about in great confusion. But I was not idle. I jumped off the bed, and into the box they all had to go, some on their heads, some on their feet. Then I shut down the lid, and seated myself upon the box. 'Now you'll have to stay,' said I, 'and I shall be cautious how I wish you flesh and blood again.'"
puppet-show-man,12,"""I felt quite light, my cheerfulness had returned, and I was the happiest of mortals. The Polytechnic professor had fully cured me. I was as happy as a king, and went to sleep on the box. Next morning--correctly speaking, it was noon, for I slept remarkably late that day--I found myself still sitting there, in happy consciousness that my former wish had been a foolish one. I inquired for the Polytechnic professor. But he had disappeared like the Greek and Roman gods. From that time I have been the happiest man in the world. I am a happy director; for none of my company ever grumble, nor the public either, for I always make them merry. I can arrange my pieces just as I please. I choose out of every comedy what I like best, and no one is offended."""
puppet-show-man,13,"""Plays that are neglected now-a-days by the great public were ran after thirty years ago, and listened to till the tears ran down the cheeks of the audience. These are the pieces I bring forward. I place them before the little ones, who cry over them as papa and mamma used to cry thirty years ago. But I make them shorter, for the youngsters don't like long speeches. And if they have anything mournful, they like it to be over quickly."""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,1,"Long, long ago, one bright autumn day in Japan, it happened, that a pink-faced monkey and a yellow crab were playing together along the bank of a river. As they were running about, the crab found a rice-dumpling and the monkey a persimmon-seed.

The crab picked up the rice-dumpling and showed it to the monkey, saying:

""Look what a nice thing I have found!""

Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said:

""I also have found something good! Look!"""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,2,"Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit, he had no use for the seed he had just found. The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone. He, therefore, in his greedy nature, felt very envious of the crab's nice dumpling, and he proposed an exchange. The crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone-like seed, and would not consent to the monkey's proposition."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,3,"Then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab, saying:

""How unwise you are not to think of the future! Your rice-dumpling can be eaten now, and is certainly much bigger than my seed; but if you sow this seed in the ground it will soon grow and become a great tree in a few years, and bear an abundance of fine ripe persimmons year after year. If only I could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches! Of course, if you don't believe me I shall sow it myself; though I am sure, later on, you will be very sorry that you did not take my advice."""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,4,"The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey's clever persuasion. He at last gave in and consented to the monkey's proposal, and the exchange was made. The greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling, and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon-seed to the crab. He would have liked to keep that too, but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor-like claws. They then separated, the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side. As soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon-seed in the ground as the monkey had told him."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,5,"In the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground. Each year it grew bigger, till at last it blossomed one spring, and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons. Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls, and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange. It was the little crab's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn, and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,6,"""How delicious they will be to eat!"" he said to himself.

At last, one day, he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one. He made several attempts to climb the tree, in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him; but he failed each time, for a crab's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones, both of which he can do most cleverly. In his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey, who, he knew, could climb trees better than any one else in the world. He determined to ask the monkey to help him, and set out to find him."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,7,"Running crab-fashion up the stony river bank, over the pathways into the shadowy forest, the crab at last found the monkey taking an afternoon nap in his favorite pine-tree, with his tail curled tight around a branch to prevent him from falling off in his dreams. He was soon wide awake, however, when he heard himself called, and eagerly listening to what the crab told him. When he heard that the seed which he had long ago exchanged for a rice-dumpling had grown into a tree and was now bearing good fruit, he was delighted, for he at once devised a cunning plan which would give him all the persimmons for himself."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,8,"He consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him. When they both reached the spot, the monkey was astonished to see what a fine tree had sprung from the seed, and with what a number of ripe persimmons the branches were loaded.

He quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat, as fast as he could, one persimmon after another. Each time he chose the best and ripest he could find, and went on eating till he could eat no more. Not one would he give to the poor hungry crab waiting below, and when he had finished there was little but the hard, unripe fruit left."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,9,"You can imagine the feelings of the poor crab after waiting patiently, for so long as he had done, for the tree to grow and the fruit to ripen, when he saw the monkey devouring all the good persimmons. He was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise. The monkey at first took no notice of the crab's complaints, but at last he picked out the hardest, greenest persimmon he could find and aimed it at the crab's head. The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe. The monkey's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow. Again and again, as fast as he could pick them, the monkey pulled off the hard persimmons and threw them at the defenseless crab till he dropped dead, covered with wounds all over his body. There he lay a pitiful sight at the foot of the tree he had himself planted."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,10,"When the wicked monkey saw that he had killed the crab he ran away from the spot as fast as he could, in fear and trembling, like a coward as he was.

Now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place. On the way home he came across his father dead, in a most dreadful condition-his head was smashed and his shell broken in several places, and around his body lay the unripe persimmons which had done their deadly work. At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,11,"But when he had wept for some time he told himself that this crying would do no good; it was his duty to avenge his father's murder, and this he determined to do. He looked about for some clue which would lead him to discover the murderer. Looking up at the tree he noticed that the best fruit had gone, and that all around lay bits of peel and numerous seeds strewn on the ground as well as the unripe persimmons which had evidently been thrown at his father. Then he understood that the monkey was the murderer, for he now remembered that his father had once told him the story of the rice-dumpling and the persimmon-seed. The young crab knew that monkeys liked persimmons above all other fruit, and he felt sure that his greed for the coveted fruit had been the cause of the old crab's death. Alas!"
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,12,"He at first thought of going to attack the monkey at once, for he burned with rage. Second thoughts, however, told him that this was useless, for the monkey was an old and cunning animal and would be hard to overcome. He must meet cunning with cunning and ask some of his friends to help him, for he knew it would be quite out of his power to kill him alone."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,13,"The young crab set out at once to call on the mortar, his father's old friend, and told him of all that had happened. He besought the mortar with tears to help him avenge his father's death. The mortar was very sorry when he heard the woful tale and promised at once to help the young crab punish the monkey to death. He warned him that he must be very careful in what he did, for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy. The mortar now sent to fetch the bee and the chestnut (also the crab's old friends) to consult them about the matter. In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived. When they were told all the details of the old crab's death and of the monkey's wickedness and greed, they both gladly consented to help the young crab in his revenge.

After talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated, and Mr. Mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,14,"While all this was taking place the monkey was congratulating himself (as the wicked often do before their punishment comes upon them) on all he had done so neatly. He thought it quite a fine thing that he had robbed his friend of all his ripe persimmons and then that he had killed him. Still, smile as hard as he might, he could not banish altogether the fear of the consequences should his evil deeds be discovered. IF he were found out (and he told himself that this could not be for he had escaped unseen) the crab's family would be sure to bear him hatred and seek to take revenge on him. So he would not go out, and kept himself at home for several days. He found this kind of life, however, extremely dull, accustomed as he was to the free life of the woods, and at last he said:

""No one knows that it was I who killed the crab! I am sure that the old thing breathed his last before I left him. Dead crabs have no mouths! Who is there to tell that I am the murderer? Since no one knows, what is the use of shutting myself up and brooding over the matter? What is done cannot be undone!"""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,15,"With this he wandered out into the crab settlement and crept about as slyly as possible near the crab's house and tried to hear the neighbors' gossip round about. He wanted to find out what the crabs were saying about their chief's death, for the old crab had been the chief of the tribe. But he heard nothing and said to himself:

""They are all such fools that they don't know and don't care who murdered their chief!"""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,16,"Little did he know in his so-called ""monkey's wisdom"" that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab's plan. He purposely pretended not to know who killed his father, and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault. By this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey, which he was meditating.

So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content. He told himself he had nothing now to fear."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,17,"One fine day, when the monkey was sitting at home, he was surprised by the appearance of a messenger from the young crab. While he was wondering what this might mean, the messenger bowed before him and said:

""I have been sent by my master to inform you that his father died the other day in falling from a persimmon tree while trying to climb the tree after fruit. This, being the seventh day, is the first anniversary after his death, and my master has prepared a little festival in his father's honor, and bids you come to participate in it as you were one of his best friends. My master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit."""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,18,"When the monkey heard these words he rejoiced in his inmost heart, for all his fears of being suspected were now at rest. He could not guess that a plot had just been set in motion against him. He pretended to be very surprised at the news of the crab's death, and said:

""I am, indeed, very sorry to hear of your chief's death. We were great friends as you know. I remember that we once exchanged a rice-dumpling for a persimmon-seed. It grieves me much to think that that seed was in the end the cause of his death. I accept your kind invitation with many thanks. I shall be delighted to do honor to my poor old friend!"" And he screwed some false tears from his eyes."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,19,"The messenger laughed inwardly and thought, ""The wicked monkey is now dropping false tears, but within a short time he shall shed real ones."" But aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home.

When he had gone, the wicked monkey laughed aloud at what he thought was the young crab's innocence, and without the least feeling began to look forward to the feast to be held that day in honor of the dead crab, to which he had been invited. He changed his dress and set out solemnly to visit the young crab."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,20,"He found all the members of the crab's family and his relatives waiting to receive and welcome him. As soon as the bows of meeting were over they led him to a hall. Here the young chief mourner came to receive him. Expressions of condolence and thanks were exchanged between them, and then they all sat down to a luxurious feast and entertained the monkey as the guest of honor."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,21,"The feast over, he was next invited to the tea-ceremony room to drink a cup of tea. When the young crab had conducted the monkey to the tearoom he left him and retired. Time passed and still he did not return. At last the monkey became impatient. He said to himself:

""This tea ceremony is always a very slow affair. I am tired of waiting so long. I am very thirsty after drinking so much sake at the dinner!"""
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,22,"He then approached the charcoal fire-place and began to pour out some hot water from the kettle boiling there, when something burst out from the ashes with a great pop and hit the monkey right in the neck. It was the chestnut, one of the crab's friends, who had hidden himself in the fireplace. The monkey, taken by surprise, jumped backward, and then started to run out of the room.

The bee, who was hiding outside the screens, now flew out and stung him on the cheek. The monkey was in great pain, his neck was burned by the chestnut and his face badly stung by the bee, but he ran on screaming and chattering with rage."
quarrel-of-monkey-and-crab,23,"Now the stone mortar had hidden himself with several other stones on the top of the crab's gate, and as the monkey ran underneath, the mortar and all fell down on the top of the monkey's head. Was it possible for the monkey to bear the weight of the mortar falling on him from the top of the gate? He lay crushed and in great pain, quite unable to get up. As he lay there helpless the young crab came up, and, holding his great claw scissors over the monkey, he said:

""Do you now remember that you murdered my father?""

""Then you-are-my-enemy?"" gasped the monkey brokenly.

""Of course,"" said the young crab.

""It-was-your-father's-fault-not-mine!"" gasped the unrepentant monkey.

""Can you still lie? I will soon put an end to your breath!"" and with that he cut off the monkey's head with his pitcher claws. Thus the wicked monkey met his well-merited punishment, and the young crab avenged his father's death.

This is the end of the story of the monkey, the crab, and the persimmon-seed."
races,1,"A prize, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,--not in a single race, but for the whole year.
""I obtained the first prize,"" said the hare. ""Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself.""
""No,"" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; ""there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance. I have heard many respectable people say so, and I can quite understand it. The snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself, and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made. He gave himself up entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the second prize."""
races,2,"""I think I ought to have had some consideration too,"" said the swallow. ""I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away."" ""Yes, that is your misfortune,"" said the fence-rail; ""you are so fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about into foreign lands when the cold commences here. You have no love of fatherland in you. There can be no consideration for you."" ""But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor,"" said the swallow, ""and suppose I slept the whole time, would that be taken into account?"" ""Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,"" said he, ""that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be treated with some consideration."""
races,3,"""I deserved the first prize, and not the second,"" said the snail. ""I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay. I, on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a cripple in the service. If any one had a first prize, it ought to have been myself. But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it."" And the snail spat at them with contempt."
races,4,"""I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize--at least, those for which I voted--was given with just and proper consideration,"" said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a member of the committee of judges. ""I always act with due order, consideration, and calculation. Seven times have I already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote; but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will. I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning, and the second by going through from the end. Be so kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from the beginning. The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize. The eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore the snail received the second prize. Next year, the letter I will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second."""
races,5,"""I should really have voted for myself,"" said the mule, ""if I had not been one of the judges on the committee. Not only the rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able to draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself. No; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed. I mean that which mankind call the beautiful. It is on the beautiful that I particularly fix my eyes. I observed the well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure to me to observe how long they are. It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my childhood; and so I voted for the hare."""
races,6,"""Buz,"" said the fly; ""there, I'm not going to make a long speech; but I wish to say something about hares. I have really overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train. I often do so. One can then so easily judge of one's own swiftness. Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs of a young hare. He had been running a long time before the engine; he had no idea that I was travelling there. At last he had to stop in his career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; for I set upon it. I left him lying there, and rode on farther. I call that conquering him; but I do not want the prize."""
races,7,"""It really seems to me,"" thought the wild rose, though she did not express her opinion aloud--it is not in her nature to do so,--though it would have been quite as well if she had; ""it certainly seems to me that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the first prize. The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable path from the sun to us. It arrives in such strength, that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhale fragrance in its presence. Our worshipful judges don't appear to have noticed this at all. Were I the sunbeam, I would give each one of them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and they are mad enough already. I only hope,"" continued the rose, ""that peace may reign in the wood. It is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and to live; to live in story and in song. The sunbeam will outlive us all."""
races,8,"""What is the first prize?"" asked the earthworm, who had overslept the time, and only now came up. ""It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,"" replied the mule. ""I proposed that as one of the prizes. The hare most decidedly must have it; and I, as an active and thoughtful member of the committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of advantage to him; so now he is provided for. The snail can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. He has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing. It is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the thing men call a 'committee.' I must say I expect much in the future; we have already made such a good beginning."""
red-shoes,1,"Once upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty. But in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was poor, and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes, so that her little instep grew quite red.
In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker's wife; she sat down and made, as well as she could, a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth. They were clumsy, but she meant well, for they were intended for the little girl, whose name was Karen.
Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on the day of her mother's funeral. They were certainly not suitable for mourning; but she had no others, and so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin.
Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, ""Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."""
red-shoes,2,"Karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and so they were burnt. Karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly; she was taught to read and to sew, and people said that she was pretty. But the mirror told her, ""You are more than pretty--you are beautiful.""
One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her. All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at. She wore neither a train nor a golden crown, but beautiful red morocco shoes; they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker's wife had sewn for little Karen. There is really nothing in the world that can be compared to red shoes!"
red-shoes,3,"Karen was now old enough to be confirmed; she received some new clothes, and she was also to have some new shoes. The rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his own room, in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty shoes and white slippers. It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it. Amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones, like those which the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count's daughter, but that they had not fitted her.
""I suppose they are of shiny leather?"" asked the old lady. ""They shine so.""
""Yes, they do shine,"" said Karen. They fitted her, and were bought. But the old lady knew nothing of their being red, for she would never have allowed Karen to be confirmed in red shoes, as she was now to be."
red-shoes,4,"Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes. It was only of these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and told her that she was now to be a grown-up Christian. The organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; but Karen thought only of her red shoes. In the afternoon the old lady heard from everybody that Karen had worn red shoes. She said that it was a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and that Karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes, even if they were old."
red-shoes,5,"On the following Sunday there was Communion. Karen looked first at the black shoes, then at the red ones--looked at the red ones again, and put them on.
The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather dusty.
At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch; he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes. Then Karen put out her little foot too. ""Dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes!"" said the soldier. ""Sit fast, when you dance,"" said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.
The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went with Karen into the church.
And all the people inside looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the figures gazed at them; when Karen knelt before the altar and put the golden goblet to her mouth, she thought only of the red shoes. It seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the goblet, and she forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the ""Lord's Prayer."""
red-shoes,6,"Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped into her carriage. But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: ""Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"" and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance. It seemed as if the shoes had got power over them. She danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run after her and seize her. He lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently. At last they took off her shoes, and her legs were at rest.
At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen could not help looking at them."
red-shoes,7,"Now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again. She had to be nursed and waited upon, and this was no one's duty more than Karen's. But there was a grand ball in the town, and Karen was invited. She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.
But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town. She danced, and was obliged to dance, far out into the dark wood. Suddenly something shone up among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a face. But it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there nodding his head and said: ""Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"""
red-shoes,8,"She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast. She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet. She danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day--but by night it was most horrible.
She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead there did not dance. They had something better to do than that. She wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows; but for her there was neither peace nor rest. And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword."
red-shoes,9,"""Dance you shall,"" said he, ""dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton! Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you! Dance you shall, dance--!""
""Mercy!"" cried Karen. But she did not hear what the angel answered, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, along highways and byways, and unceasingly she had to dance.
One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried out covered with flowers. Then she knew that she was forsaken by every one and damned by the angel of God."
red-shoes,10,"She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the dark night. The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding; she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house. Here, she knew, lived the executioner; and she tapped with her finger at the window and said:
""Come out, come out! I cannot come in, for I must dance.""
And the executioner said: ""I don't suppose you know who I am. I strike off the heads of the wicked, and I notice that my axe is tingling to do so.""
""Don't cut off my head!"" said Karen, ""for then I could not repent of my sin. But cut off my feet with the red shoes.""
And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest.
And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the heath."
red-shoes,11,"""Now, I have suffered enough for the red shoes,"" she said; ""I will go to church, so that people can see me."" And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: ""Now I have suffered and striven enough. I believe I am quite as good as many of those who sit in church and give themselves airs."" And so she went boldly on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her. Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin."
red-shoes,12,"She went to the parsonage, and begged that she might be taken into service there. She would be industrious, she said, and do everything that she could; she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people. The pastor's wife had pity on her, and took her into service. And she was industrious and thoughtful. She sat quiet and listened when the pastor read aloud from the Bible in the evening. All the children liked her very much, but when they spoke about dress and grandeur and beauty she would shake her head."
red-shoes,13,"On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches. And then the others went to hear God's Word, but she went alone into her little room; this was only large enough to hold the bed and a chair. Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: ""O God! help me!"""
red-shoes,14,"Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood an angel of God in white robes; it was the same one whom she had seen that night at the church-door. He no longer carried the sharp sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched it there shone a golden star. He touched the walls, which opened wide apart, and she saw the organ which was pealing forth; she saw the pictures of the old pastors and their wives, and the congregation sitting in the polished chairs and singing from their hymn-books. The church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or the room had gone to the church. She sat in the pew with the rest of the pastor's household, and when they had finished the hymn and looked up, they nodded and said, ""It was right of you to come, Karen."""
red-shoes,15,"""It was mercy,"" said she.
The organ played and the children's voices in the choir sounded soft and lovely. The bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where Karen sat, and her heart became so filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked after the Red Shoes."
remarkable-rocket,1,"The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.  He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.  She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  ""She is like a white rose!"" they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies."
remarkable-rocket,2,"At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.

""Your picture was beautiful,"" he murmured, ""but you are more beautiful than your picture""; and the little Princess blushed.

""She was like a white rose before,"" said a young Page to his neighbour, ""but she is like a red rose now""; and the whole Court was delighted."
remarkable-rocket,3,"For the next three days everybody went about saying, ""White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose""; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.

When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy."
remarkable-rocket,4,"""It's quite clear that they love each other,"" said the little Page, ""as clear as crystal!"" and the King doubled his salary a second time.  ""What an honour!"" cried all the courtiers.

After the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, ""Charming! charming!""

The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage."
remarkable-rocket,5,"What are fireworks like?"" she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.

""They are like the Aurora Borealis,"" said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, ""only much more natural.  I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must certainly see them.""

So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other."
remarkable-rocket,5,"""The world is certainly very beautiful,"" cried a little Squib.  ""Just look at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.""

""The King's garden is not the world, you foolish squib,"" said a big Roman Candle; ""the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.""

""Any place you love is the world to you,"" exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; ""but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I remember myself once-But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the past."""
remarkable-rocket,6,"""Nonsense!"" said the Roman Candle, ""Romance never dies.  It is like the moon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news.""

But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  ""Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,"" she murmured.  She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.

Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round."
remarkable-rocket,7,"It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.

""Ahem! ahem!"" he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, ""Romance is dead.""

""Order! order!"" cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.

""Quite dead,"" whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep."
remarkable-rocket,8,"As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.

""How fortunate it is for the King's son,"" he remarked, ""that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.""

""Dear me!"" said the little Squib, ""I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."""
remarkable-rocket,9,"""It may be so with you,"" he answered; ""indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."
remarkable-rocket,10,"""Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,"" said a Bengal Light; ""I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.""

""Well, I said Pylotechnic,"" answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.

""I was saying,"" continued the Rocket, ""I was saying-What was I saying?""

""You were talking about yourself,"" replied the Roman Candle.

""Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that."""
remarkable-rocket,11,"""What is a sensitive person?"" said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.

""A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,"" answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.

""Pray, what are you laughing at?"" inquired the Rocket; ""I am not laughing.""

""I am laughing because I am happy,"" replied the Cracker."
remarkable-rocket,12,"""That is a very selfish reason,"" said the Rocket angrily.  ""What right have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you should be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.  It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.""

""If you want to give pleasure to others,"" cried the Roman Candle, ""you had better keep yourself dry.""

""Certainly,"" exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; ""that is only common sense."""
remarkable-rocket,13,"""Common sense, indeed!"" said the Rocket indignantly; ""you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don't care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."""
remarkable-rocket,14,"""Well, really,"" exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, ""why not?  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.""

""Ah! what a trivial view of life!"" said the Rocket; ""but it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it."""
remarkable-rocket,15,"""But they have not lost their only son,"" said the Roman Candle; ""no misfortune has happened to them at all.""

""I never said that they had,"" replied the Rocket; ""I said that they might.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.""

""You certainly are!"" cried the Bengal Light.  ""In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.""

""You are the rudest person I ever met,"" said the Rocket, ""and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.""

""Why, you don't even know him,"" growled the Roman Candle."
remarkable-rocket,16,"""I never said I knew him,"" answered the Rocket.  ""I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.""

""You had really better keep yourself dry,"" said the Fire-balloon.  ""That is the important thing.""

""Very important for you, I have no doubt,"" answered the Rocket, ""but I shall weep if I choose""; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.

""He must have a truly romantic nature,"" said the Catherine Wheel, ""for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about""; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box."
remarkable-rocket,17,"But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, ""Humbug! humbug!"" at the top of their voices.  They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.

Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.

The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.

Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.

""Let the fireworks begin,"" said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole."
remarkable-rocket,18,"It was certainly a magnificent display.

Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.  Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  ""Good-bye,"" cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.  Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.

""I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,"" said the Rocket; ""no doubt that is what it means,"" and he looked more supercilious than ever."
remarkable-rocket,19,"The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  ""This is evidently a deputation,"" said the Rocket; ""I will receive them with becoming dignity"" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them caught sight of him.  ""Hallo!"" he cried, ""what a bad rocket!"" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.

""Bad Rocket?  Bad Rocket?"" he said, as he whirled through the air; ""impossible!  Grand Rocket, that is what the man said.  Bad and Grand sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same""; and he fell into the mud.

""It is not comfortable here,"" he remarked, ""but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."""
remarkable-rocket,20,"Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.

""A new arrival, I see!"" said the Frog.  ""Well, after all there is nothing like mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!""

""Ahem! ahem!"" said the Rocket, and he began to cough.

""What a delightful voice you have!"" cried the Frog.  ""Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular."""
remarkable-rocket,21,"""Ahem! ahem!"" said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.

""A delightful voice, certainly,"" continued the Frog; ""I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.""

""Conversation, indeed!"" said the Rocket.  ""You have talked the whole time yourself.  That is not conversation.""

""Somebody must listen,"" answered the Frog, ""and I like to do all the talking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.""

""But I like arguments,"" said the Rocket."
remarkable-rocket,22,"""I hope not,"" said the Frog complacently.  ""Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.  Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.

""You are a very irritating person,"" said the Rocket, ""and very ill-bred.  I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."""
remarkable-rocket,23,"""There is no good talking to him,"" said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; ""no good at all, for he has gone away.""

""Well, that is his loss, not mine,"" answered the Rocket.  ""I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like hearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.""

""Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,"" said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.

""How very silly of him not to stay here!"" said the Rocket.  ""I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However, I don't care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day""; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud."
remarkable-rocket,24,"After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.

""Quack, quack, quack,"" she said.  ""What a curious shape you are!  May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?""

""It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,"" answered the Rocket, ""otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your ignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."""
remarkable-rocket,25,"""I don't think much of that,"" said the Duck, ""as I cannot see what use it is to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.""

""My good creature,"" cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, ""I see that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is never useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.""

""Well, well,"" said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, ""everybody has different tastes.  I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."""
remarkable-rocket,26,"""Oh! dear no,"" cried the Rocket.  ""I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is neither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.  I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.""

""I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,"" remarked the Duck; ""there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much effect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.""

""I am made for public life,"" said the Rocket, ""and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great attention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things."""
remarkable-rocket,27,"""Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!"" said the Duck; ""and that reminds me how hungry I feel"": and she swam away down the stream, saying, ""Quack, quack, quack.""

""Come back! come back!"" screamed the Rocket, ""I have a great deal to say to you""; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  ""I am glad that she has gone,"" he said to himself, ""she has a decidedly middle-class mind""; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some sticks.

""This must be the deputation,"" said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified."
remarkable-rocket,28,"""Hallo!"" cried one of the boys, ""look at this old stick!  I wonder how it came here""; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.

""Old Stick!"" said the Rocket, ""impossible!  Gold Stick, that is what he said.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!""

""Let us put it into the fire!"" said the other boy, ""it will help to boil the kettle.""

So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.

""This is magnificent,"" cried the Rocket, ""they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me."""
remarkable-rocket,29,"""We will go to sleep now,"" they said, ""and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled""; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.

The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last, however, the fire caught him.

""Now I am going off!"" he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.  ""I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high that-""

Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.

""Delightful!"" he cried, ""I shall go on like this for ever.  What a success I am!""

But nobody saw him."
remarkable-rocket,30,"Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.

""Now I am going to explode,"" he cried.  ""I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.""  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.

But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.

Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.

""Good heavens!"" cried the Goose.  ""It is going to rain sticks""; and she rushed into the water.

""I knew I should create a great sensation,"" gasped the Rocket, and he went out."
robber-bridegroom,1,"THERE was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she was grown up he became anxious that she should be well married and taken care of; so he thought, 
""If a decent sort of man comes and asks her in marriage, I will give her to him."" 
Soon after a suitor came forward who seemed very well to do, and as the miller knew nothing to his disadvantage, he promised him his daughter. But the girl did not seem to love him as a bride should love her bridegroom; she had no confidence in him; as often as she saw him or thought about him, she felt a chill at her heart. One day he said to her, ""You are to be my bride, and yet you have never been to see me."" 
The girl answered,  ""I do not know where your house is."" 
Then he said,  ""My house is a long way in the wood."""
robber-bridegroom,2,"She began to make excuses, and said she could not find the way to it; but the bridegroom said, 
""You must come and pay me a visit next Sunday; I have already invited company, and I will strew ashes on the path through the wood, so that you will be sure to find it."" 
When Sunday came, and the girl set out on her way, she felt very uneasy without knowing exactly why; and she filled both pockets full of peas and lentils. There were ashes strewed on the path through the wood, but, nevertheless, at each step she cast to the right and left a few peas on the ground. So she went on the whole day until she came to the middle of the wood, where it was the darkest, and there stood a lonely house, not pleasant in her eyes, for it was dismal and unhomelike. She walked in, but there was no one there, and the greatest stillness reigned. Suddenly she heard a voice cry, 
    ""Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,     Within this house thou must not bide,     For here do evil things betide."""
robber-bridegroom,3,"The girl glanced round, and perceived that the voice came from a bird who was hanging in a cage by the wall. And again it cried, 
    ""Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,     Within this house thou must not bide,     For here do evil things betide."" 
Then the pretty bride went on from one room into another through the whole house, but it was quite empty, and no soul to be found in it. 
At last she reached the cellar, and there sat a very old woman nodding her head. 
""Can you tell me,"" said the bride, ""if my bridegroom lives here?"" 
""Oh, poor child,"" answered the old woman, ""do you know what has happened to you? You are in a place of cut-throats. You thought you were a bride, and soon to be married, but death will be your spouse. Look here, I have a great kettle of water to set on, and when once they have you in their power they will cut you in pieces without mercy, cook you, and eat you, for they are cannibals. Unless I have pity on you, and save you, all is over with you!"""
robber-bridegroom,4,"Then the old woman hid her behind a great cask, where she could not be seen. 
""Be as still as a mouse,"" said she; ""do not move or go away, or else you are lost. At night, when the robbers are asleep, we will escape. I have been waiting a long time for an opportunity."" 
No sooner was it settled than the wicked gang entered the house. They brought another young woman with them, dragging her along, and they were drunk, and would not listen to her cries and groans. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and then they cut her in pieces. The poor bride all the while shaking and trembling when she saw what a fate the robbers had intended for her. One of them noticed on the little finger of their victim a golden ring, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took an axe and chopped it off, but the finger jumped away, and fell behind the cask on the bride's lap. The robber took up a light to look for it, but he could not find it."
robber-bridegroom,5,"Then said one of the others, 
""Have you looked behind the great cask?"" 
But the old woman cried, 
""Come to supper, and leave off looking till to-morrow; the finger cannot run away."" 
Then the robbers said the old woman was right, and they left off searching, and sat down to eat, and the old woman dropped some sleeping stuff into their wine, so that before long they stretched themselves on the cellar floor, sleeping and snoring."
robber-bridegroom,6,"When the bride heard that, she came from behind the cask, and had to make her way among the sleepers lying all about on the ground, and she felt very much afraid lest she might awaken any of them. But by good luck she passed through, and the old woman with her, and they opened the door, and they made all haste to leave that house of murderers. The wind had carried away the ashes from the path, but the peas and lentils had budded and sprung up, and the moonshine upon them showed the way. And they went on through the night, till in the morning they reached the mill. Then the girl related to her father all that had happened to her."
robber-bridegroom,7,"When the wedding-day came, the friends and neighbours assembled, the miller having invited them, and the bridegroom also appeared. When they were all seated at table, each one had to tell a story. But the bride sat still, and said nothing, till at last the bridegroom said to her, 
""Now, sweetheart, do you know no story? Tell us something."" 
She answered, 
""I will tell you my dream. I was going alone through a wood, and I came at last to a house in which there was no living soul, but by the wall was a bird in a cage, who cried, 
    'Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,     Within this house thou must not bide,     For evil things do here betide.'"""
robber-bridegroom,8,"""And then again it said it. Sweetheart, the dream is not ended. Then I went through all the rooms, and they were all empty, and it was so lonely and wretched. At last I went down into the cellar, and there sat an old old woman, nodding her head. I asked her if my bridegroom lived in that house, and she answered, 'Ah, poor child, you have come into a place of cut-throats; your bridegroom does live here, but he will kill you and cut you in pieces, and then cook and eat you.' Sweetheart, the dream is not ended."""
robber-bridegroom,9,"""But the old woman hid me behind a great cask, and no sooner had she done so than the robbers came home, dragging with them a young woman, and they gave her to drink wine thrice, white, red, and yellow. Sweetheart, the dream is not yet ended. And then they killed her, and cut her in pieces. Sweetheart, my dream is not yet ended. And one of the robbers saw a gold ring on the finger of the young woman, and as it was difficult to get off, he took an axe and chopped off the finger, which jumped upwards, and then fell behind the great cask on my lap. And here is the finger with the ring!"" At these words she drew it forth, and showed it to the company. 
The robber, who during the story had grown deadly white, sprang up, and would have escaped, but the folks held him fast, and delivered him up to justice. And he and his whole gang were, for their evil deeds, condemned and executed."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,1,"Once upon a time there was a peasant who wanted to go to sell a pig.
After he had gone a while, he met a man who asked him where he was
going with his pig. ""I want to sell it,"" answered the peasant, ""but I
do not know what to do to get rid of it."" ""Go to the devil,"" said the
man, ""he will be the first to rid you of it."" So the peasant kept on
along the broad highway."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,2,"When he came to the devil's place, there stood a man out by the
wood-pile making wood. The peasant went to him and asked whether he
could tell him if they wanted to buy a pig in the devil's place. ""I'll
go in and ask,"" said the man, ""if you will make wood in my stead while
I am gone."" ""Yes, I will do that gladly,"" said the peasant, took the
ax, stood at the wood-pile and began to make wood. And he worked and
worked until evening came; but the man did not return to tell him
whether they would or would not buy a pig in the devil's place."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,3,"At length another man came that way, and the peasant asked him whether
he would make wood in his stead, for it was impossible to lay down the
ax unless another took it up and went on working. So the man took the
ax and stood there making wood, and the peasant went into the devil's
place himself, and asked whether any one wanted to buy a pig."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,4,"A crowd as large as that at a fair at once gathered, and all wanted to
buy the pig. Then the peasant thought: ""Whoever pays the most, gets
it."" And one would overbid another, offering far more than a whole
herd of pigs were worth. But at last a gentleman came along who
whispered something to the peasant, and told him to come along with
him; and he could have all the money he wanted."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,5,"So when they had reached the gentleman's house, and the peasant had
given him the pig, he received in payment a rooster who would lay
silver coins as often as he was told to do so. Then the peasant went
his way, well content with his bargain. But on the way home he stayed
overnight at a tavern kept by an old woman. And he was so exceedingly
happy about his splendid rooster, that he had to boast about him to
the old woman, and show her how he went about laying silver coins. And
at night, when the peasant was fast asleep, the old woman came and
took away his rooster, and put another in its place. No sooner did
the peasant awake in the morning than he wanted to set his rooster to
work."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,6,"""Lay quickly, rooster of mine! Lay big silver coins, my
rooster!"" But the rooster could lay no silver coins at all, and only
answered ""Kikeriki! Kikeriki! Kikeriki!"" Then the peasant fell into a
rage, wandered back to the devil's place, complained about the
rooster, and told how absolutely worthless he was. He was kindly
received, and the same gentleman gave him a hand-mill. When he called
out ""Mill grind!"" to it, it would grind as much meal as he wanted it
to, and would not stop until he said: ""Mill, stop grinding!"" And the
mill would grind out every kind of meal for which he asked."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,7,"When the peasant set out for home, he reached the same tavern at which
he had already put up in the evening, so he turned in and decided to
stay over night. He was so pleased with the mill that it was
impossible for him to hold his tongue; so he told the old woman what a
valuable mill he had, and showed her how it worked. But during the
night, while he was asleep, the old woman came and stole his mill and
put another in its place."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,8,"When the peasant awoke in the morning, he was in a great hurry to test
his mill; but he could not make it obey. ""Mill grind!"" he cried. But
the mill stood still. Then he said: ""Dear mill, grind wheat meal!""
but it had no effect. ""Then grind rye meal!"" he shouted; but that did
not help, either. ""Well, then, grind peas!"" But the mill did not seem
to hear; but stood as still as though it had never turned a single
time in all its life. Then the peasant took the road back to the
devil's place again, and at once hunted up the gentleman who had
purchased his pig, and told him the mill would grind no more meal."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,9,"""Do not grieve about that,"" said the gentleman, and gave him a large,
large hornets' nest, full of hornets, who flew out in swarms and stung
any one whom they were told to sting, until one said ""stop!"" to them.
Now when the peasant again came to the old woman, he told her he had a
swarm of hornets who obeyed his commands. ""Heavens above!"" cried the
woman, ""that's something worth while seeing!"" ""You may see it without
any trouble,"" replied the peasant, and at once called: ""Out, out, my
hornets and sting the old woman!"" And at once the entire swarm fell
upon the old woman, who began to scream pitifully. She begged the
peasant to please call back his hornets, and said she was only too
willing to give back the rooster and the mill she had taken."
rooster-handmill-swarm-of-hornets,10,"The peasant did not object to this; but ordered his hornets to leave
the old woman alone, and fly back into their house. Then he went home
with his rooster, his mill and his hornets, became a rich man and
lived happily until he died. And he was in the habit of saying: ""They
have a big fair in the devil's place, and you find real decent people
there, and above all, a liberal gentleman, with whom it is a pleasure
to do business."""
rose-of-evening,1,"On the fifth day of the fifth month the festival of the Dragon Junk is
held along the Yangtze-kiang. A dragon is hollowed out of wood,
painted with an armor of scales, and adorned with gold and bright
colors. A carved red railing surrounds this ship, and its sails and
flags are made of silks and brocade. The after part of the vessel is
called the dragon's tail. It rises ten feet above the water, and a
board which floats in the water is tied to it by means of a cloth."
rose-of-evening,2,"Upon this board sit boys who turn somersaults, stand on their heads,
and perform all sorts of tricks. Yet, being so close to the water
their danger is very great. It is the custom, therefore, when a boy is
hired for this purpose, to give his parents money before he is
trained. Then, if he falls into the water and is drowned, no one has
him on their conscience. Farther South the custom differs in so much
that instead of boys, beautiful girls are chosen for this purpose."
rose-of-evening,3,"In Dschen-Giang there once lived a widow named Dsiang, who had a son
called Aduan. When he was no more than seven years of age he was
extraordinarily skilful, and no other boy could equal him. And his
reputation increasing as he grew, he earned more and more money. So it
happened that he was still called upon at the Dragon Junk Festival
when he was already sixteen.

But one day he fell into the water below the Gold Island and was
drowned. He was the only son of his mother, and she sorrowed over him,
and that was the end of it."
rose-of-evening,4,"Yet Aduan did not know that he had been drowned. He met two men who
took him along with them, and he saw a new world in the midst of the
waters of the Yellow River. When he looked around, the waves of the
river towered steeply about him like walls, and a palace was visible,
in which sat a man wearing armor and a helmet. His two companions said
to him: ""That is the Prince of the Dragon's Cave!"" and bade him kneel.

The Prince of the Dragon's Cave seemed to be of a mild and kindly
disposition and said: ""We can make use of such a skilful lad. He may
take part in the dance of the willow branches!"""
rose-of-evening,5,"So he was brought to a spot surrounded by extensive buildings. He
entered, and was greeted by a crowd of boys who were all about
fourteen years of age.

An old woman came in and they all called out: ""This is Mother Hia!""
And she sat down and had Aduan show his tricks. Then she taught him
the dance of the flying thunders of Tsian-Tang River, and the music
that calms the winds on the sea of Dung-Ting. When the cymbals and
kettledrums reechoed through all the courts, they deafened the ear.
Then, again, all the courts would fall silent. Mother Hia thought that
Aduan would not be able to grasp everything the very first time; so
she taught him with great patience. But Aduan had understood
everything from the first, and that pleased old Mother Hia. ""This
boy,"" said she, ""equals our own Rose of Evening!"""
rose-of-evening,6,"The following day the Prince of the Dragon's Cave held a review of his
dancers. When all the dancers had assembled, the dance of the Ogres
was danced first. Those who performed it all wore devil-masks and
garments of scales. They beat upon enormous cymbals, and their
kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them.
Their sound was like the sound of a mighty thunder, and the noise was
so great that nothing else could be heard. When the dance began,
tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies, and then fell down
again like star-glimmer which scatters in the air."
rose-of-evening,7,"The Prince of the Dragon Cave hastily bade the dance cease, and had
the dancers of the nightingale round step forth. These were all lovely
young girls of sixteen. They made a delicate music with flutes, so
that the breeze blew and the roaring of the waves was stilled in a
moment. The water gradually became as quiet as a crystal world,
transparent to its lowest depths. When the nightingale dancers had
finished, they withdrew and posted themselves in the western
courtyard."
rose-of-evening,8,"Then came the turn of the swallow dancers. These were all little
girls. One among them, who was about fifteen years of age, danced the
dance of the giving of flowers with flying sleeves and waving locks.
And as their garments fluttered, many-colored flowers dropped from
their folds, and were caught up by the wind and whirled about the
whole courtyard. When the dance had ended, this dancer also went off
with the rest of the girls to the western courtyard. Aduan looked at
her from out the corner of his eye, and fell deeply in love with her.
He asked his comrades who she might be and they told him she was named
""Rose of Evening."""
rose-of-evening,9,"But the willow-spray dancers were now called out. The Prince of the
Dragon Cave was especially desirous of testing Aduan. So Aduan danced
alone, and he danced with joy or defiance according to the music. When
he looked up and when he looked down his glances held the beat of the
measure. The Dragon Prince, enchanted with his skill, presented him
with a garment of five colors, and gave him a carbuncle set in golden
threads of fish-beard for a hair-jewel. Aduan bowed his thanks for the
gift, and then also hastened to the western courtyard. There all the
dancers stood in rank and file. Aduan could only look at Rose of
Evening from a distance, but still Rose of Evening returned his
glances."
rose-of-evening,10,"After a time Aduan gradually slipped to the end of his file and Rose
of Evening also drew near to him, so that they stood only a few feet
away from each other. But the strict rules allowed no confusion in the
ranks, so they could only gaze and let their souls go out to each
other.

Now the butterfly dance followed the others. This was danced by the
boys and girls together, and the pairs were equal in size, age and the
color of their garments. When all the dances had ended, the dancers
marched out with the goose-step. The willow-spray dancers followed the
swallow dancers, and Aduan hastened in advance of his company, while
Rose of Evening lingered along after hers. She turned her head, and
when she spied Aduan she purposely let a coral pin fall from her hair.
Aduan hastily hid it in his sleeve."
rose-of-evening,11,"When he had returned, he was sick with longing, and could neither eat
nor sleep. Mother Hia brought him all sorts of dainties, looked after
him three or four times a day, and stroked his forehead with loving
care. But his illness did not yield in the least. Mother Hia was
unhappy, and yet helpless.

""The birthday of the King of the Wu River is at hand,"" said she. ""What
is to be done?"""
rose-of-evening,12,"In the twilight there came a boy, who sat down on the edge of Aduan's
bed and chatted with him. He belonged to the butterfly dancers, said
he, and asked casually: ""Are you sick because of Rose of Evening?""
Aduan, frightened, asked him how he came to guess it. The other boy
said, with a smile: ""Well, because Rose of Evening is in the same case
as yourself.""

Disconcerted, Aduan sat up and begged the boy to advise him. ""Are you
able to walk?"" asked the latter. ""If I exert myself,"" said Aduan, ""I
think I could manage it."""
rose-of-evening,13,"So the boy led him to the South. There he opened a gate and they
turned the corner, to the West. Once more the doors of the gate flew
open, and now Aduan saw a lotus field about twenty acres in size. The
lotus flowers were all growing on level earth, and their leaves were
as large as mats and their flowers like umbrellas. The fallen blossoms
covered the ground beneath the stalks to the depth of a foot or more.
The boy led Aduan in and said, ""Now first of all sit down for a little
while!"" Then he went away."
rose-of-evening,14,"After a time a beautiful girl thrust aside the lotus flowers and came
into the open. It was Rose of Evening. They looked at each other with
happy timidity, and each told how each had longed for the other. And
they also told each other of their former life. Then they weighted the
lotus-leaves with stones so that they made a cozy retreat, in which
they could be together, and promised to meet each other there every
evening. And then they parted.

Aduan came back and his illness left him. From that time on he met
Rose of Evening every day in the lotus field."
rose-of-evening,15,"After a few days had passed they had to accompany the Prince of the
Dragon Cave to the birthday festival of the King of the Wu River. The
festival came to an end, and all the dancers returned home. Only, the
King had kept back Rose of Evening and one of the nightingale dancers
to teach the girls in his castle."
rose-of-evening,16,"Months passed and no news came from Rose of Evening, so that Aduan
went about full of longing and despair. Now Mother Hia went every day
to the castle of the god of the Wu River. So Aduan told her that Rose
of Evening was his cousin, and entreated her to take him along with
her so that he could at least see her a single time. So she took him
along, and let him stay at the lodge-house of the river-god for a few
days. But the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that
he could not see Rose of Evening even a single time. Sadly Aduan went
back again."
rose-of-evening,17,"Another month passed and Aduan, filled with gloomy thoughts, wished
that death might be his portion.

One day Mother Hia came to him full of pity, and began to sympathize
with him. ""What a shame,"" said she, ""that Rose of Evening has cast
herself into the river!"""
rose-of-evening,18,"Aduan was extremely frightened, and his tears flowed resistlessly. He
tore his beautiful garments, took his gold and his pearls, and went
out with the sole idea of following his beloved in death. Yet the
waters of the river stood up before him like walls, and no matter how
often he ran against them, head down, they always flung him back."
rose-of-evening,19,"He did not dare return, since he feared he might be questioned about
his festival garments, and severely punished because he had ruined
them. So he stood there and knew not what to do, while the
perspiration ran down to his ankles. Suddenly, at the foot of the
water-wall he saw a tall tree. Like a monkey he climbed up to its very
top, and then, with all his might, he shot into the waves."
rose-of-evening,20,"And then, without being wet, he found himself suddenly swimming on
the surface of the river. Unexpectedly the world of men rose up once
more before his dazzled eyes. He swam to the shore, and as he walked
along the river-bank, his thoughts went back to his old mother. He
took a ship and traveled home."
rose-of-evening,21,"When he reached the village, it seemed to him as though all the houses
in it belonged to another world. The following morning he entered his
mother's house, and as he did so, heard a girl's voice beneath the
window saying: ""Your son has come back again!"" The voice sounded like
the voice of Rose of Evening, and when she came to greet him at his
mother's side, sure enough, it was Rose of Evening herself.

And in that hour the joy of these two who were so fond of each other
overcame all their sorrow. But in the mother's mind sorrow and doubt,
terror and joy mingled in constant succession in a thousand different
ways."
rose-of-evening,22,"When Rose of Evening had been in the palace of the river-king, and had
come to realize that she would never see Aduan again, she determined
to die, and flung herself into the waters of the stream. But she was
carried to the surface, and the waves carried and cradled her till a
ship came by and took her aboard. They asked whence she came. Now Rose
of Evening had originally been a celebrated singing girl of Wu, who
had fallen into the river and whose body had never been found. So she
thought to herself that, after all, she could not return to her old
life again."
rose-of-evening,23,"So she answered: ""Madame Dsiang, in Dschen-Giang is my
mother-in-law."" Then the travelers took passage for her in a ship
which brought her to the place she had mentioned. The widow Dsiang
first said she must be mistaken, but the girl insisted that there was
no mistake, and told Aduan's mother her whole story. Yet, though the
latter was charmed by her surpassing loveliness, she feared that Rose
of Evening was too young to live a widow's life. But the girl was
respectful and industrious, and when she saw that poverty ruled in her
new home, she took her pearls and sold them for a high price. Aduan's
old mother was greatly pleased to see how seriously the girl took her
duties."
rose-of-evening,24,"Now that Aduan had returned again Rose of Evening could not control
her joy. And even Aduan's old mother cherished the hope that, after
all, perhaps her son had not died. She secretly dug up her son's
grave, yet all his bones were still lying in it. So she questioned
Aduan. And then, for the first time, the latter realized that he was a
departed spirit."
rose-of-evening,25,"Then he feared that Rose of Evening might regard him
with disgust because he was no longer a human being. So he ordered his
mother on no account to speak of it, and this his mother promised.
Then she spread the report in the village that the body which had been
found in the river had not been that of her son at all. Yet she could
not rid herself of the fear that, since Aduan was a departed spirit,
heaven might refuse to send him a child."
rose-of-evening,26,"In spite of her fear, however, she was able to hold a grandson in her
arms in course of time. When she looked at him, he was no different
from other children, and then her cup of joy was filled to
overflowing.

Rose of Evening gradually became aware of the fact that Aduan was not
really a human being. ""Why did you not tell me at once?"" said she.
""Departed spirits who wear the garments of the dragon castle, surround
themselves with a soul-casing so heavy in texture that they can no
longer be distinguished from the living. And if one can obtain the
lime made of dragon-horn which is in the castle, then the bones may be
glued together in such wise that flesh and blood will grow over them
again. What a pity that we could not obtain the lime while we were
there!"""
rose-of-evening,27,"Aduan sold his pearl, for which a merchant from foreign parts gave him
an enormous sum. Thus his family grew very wealthy. Once, on his
mother's birthday, he danced with his wife and sang, in order to
please her. The news reached the castle of the Dragon Prince and he
thought to carry off Rose of Evening by force. But Aduan, alarmed,
went to the Prince, and declared that both he and his wife were
departed spirits. They examined him and since he cast no shadow, his
word was taken, and he was not robbed of Rose of Evening."
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,1,"Long, long ago, there lived in the province of Shinshin in Japan, a traveling monkey-man, who earned his living by taking round a monkey and showing off the animal's tricks.

One evening the man came home in a very bad temper and told his wife to send for the butcher the next morning.

The wife was very bewildered and asked her husband:

""Why do you wish me to send for the butcher?""

""It's no use taking that monkey round any longer, he's too old and forgets his tricks. I beat him with my stick all I know how, but he won't dance properly. I must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him I can. There is nothing else to be done."""
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,2,"The woman felt very sorry for the poor little animal, and pleaded for her husband to spare the monkey, but her pleading was all in vain, the man was determined to sell him to the butcher.

Now the monkey was in the next room and overheard every word of the conversation. He soon understood that he was to be killed, and he said to himself:

""Barbarous, indeed, is my master! Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten? Woe is me! What am I to do. Ah! a bright thought has struck me! There is, I know, a wild boar living in the forest near by. I have often heard tell of his wisdom. Perhaps if I go to him and tell him the strait I am in he will give me his counsel. I will go and try."""
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,3,"There was no time to lose. The monkey slipped out of the house and ran as quickly as he could to the forest to find the boar. The boar was at home, and the monkey began his tale of woe at once.

""Good Mr. Boar, I have heard of your excellent wisdom. I am in great trouble, you alone can help me. I have grown old in the service of my master, and because I cannot dance properly now he intends to sell me to the butcher. What do you advise me to do? I know how clever you are!"""
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,4,"The boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey. He thought for a little while and then said:

""Hasn't your master a baby?""

""Oh, yes,"" said the monkey, ""he has one infant son.""

""Doesn't it lie by the door in the morning when your mistress begins the work of the day? Well, I will come round early and when I see my opportunity I will seize the child and run off with it.""

""What then?"" said the monkey.

""Why the mother will be in a tremendous scare, and before your master and mistress know what to do, you must run after me and rescue the child and take it home safely to its parents, and you will see that when the butcher comes they won't have the heart to sell you."""
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,5,"The monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home. He did not sleep much that night, as you may imagine, for thinking of the morrow. His life depended on whether the boar's plan succeeded or not. He was the first up, waiting anxiously for what was to happen. It seemed to him a very long time before his master's wife began to move about and open the shutters to let in the light of day. Then all happened as the boar had planned. The mother placed her child near the porch as usual while she tidied up the house and got her breakfast ready.

The child was crooning happily in the morning sunlight, dabbing on the mats at the play of light and shadow. Suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child. The mother ran out from the kitchen to the spot, only just in time to see the boar disappearing through the gate with her child in its clutch. She flung out her hands with a loud cry of despair and rushed into the inner room where her husband was still sleeping soundly."
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,6,"He sat up slowly and rubbed his eyes, and crossly demanded what his wife was making all that noise about. By the time that the man was alive to what had happened, and they both got outside the gate, the boar had got well away, but they saw the monkey running after the thief as hard as his legs would carry him.

Both the man and wife were moved to admiration at the plucky conduct of the sagacious monkey, and their gratitude knew no bounds when the faithful monkey brought the child safely back to their arms."
sagacious-monkey-and-boar,7,"""There!"" said the wife. ""This is the animal you want to kill-if the monkey hadn't been here we should have lost our child forever.""

""You are right, wife, for once,"" said the man as he carried the child into the house. ""You may send the butcher back when he comes, and now give us all a good breakfast and the monkey too.""

When the butcher arrived he was sent away with an order for some boar's meat for the evening dinner, and the monkey was petted and lived the rest of his days in peace, nor did his master ever strike him again."
secret-church,1,"Once the schoolmaster of Etnedal was staying in the mountains to fish.
He was very fond of reading, and so he always carried one book or
another along with him, with which he could lie down, and which he
read on holidays, or when the weather forced him to stay in the little
fishing-hut. One Sunday morning, as he was lying there reading, it
seemed as though he could hear church bells; sometimes they sounded
faintly, as though from a great distance; at other times the sound
was clear, as though carried by the wind. He listened long and with
surprise; and did not trust his ears--for he knew that it was impossible
to hear the bells of the parish church so far out among the hills--yet
suddenly they sounded quite clearly on his ear. So he laid aside his
book, stood up and went out. The sun was shining, the weather was fine, and one group of churchgoers after another passed him in their Sunday clothes, their hymn-books in their hands. A little further on in the forest, where he had never before seen anything but trees and brush, stood an old wooden church."
secret-church,2,"After a time the priest came by, and he was so old and decrepit that his wife and daughter led him. And when they came to the spot where the schoolmaster was standing, they stopped and invited him to come to church and hear mass. The schoolmaster thought for a moment; but since it occurred to him that it might be amusing to see how these people worshiped God, he said he would go along, if he did not thereby suffer harm. No, no harm should come to him, said they, but rather a blessing. In the church all went forward in a quiet and orderly manner, there were neither dogs nor crying children to disturb the service, and the singing was good--but he could not make out the words. When the priest had been led to the pulpit he delivered what seemed to the listening schoolmaster a really fine and edifying sermon--but one, it appeared to him, of quite a peculiar trend of thought, which he was not always able to follow. Nor did the ""Our Father in heaven ..."" sound just right, and the ""Deliver us from evil ..."" he did not hear at all. Nor was the name of Jesus uttered; and at the close no blessing was spoken."
secret-church,3,"When mass had been said, the schoolmaster was invited to the parsonage. He gave the same answer he had already returned, that he would be glad to go if he suffered no harm thereby. And as before, they assured him he would not lose; but rather gain thereby. So he went with them to the parsonage, just such an attractive and well-built parsonage like most in the neighborhood. It had a garden with flowers and apple-trees, with a neat lattice fence around it. They invited him to dinner, and the dinner was well cooked and carefully prepared. As before, he said that he would gladly accept their invitation, if he came to no harm thereby, and was given the same reply. So he ate with them, and said later that he had noticed no difference between this food and the Christian dinner he had received when, once or twice, he had been asked to dinner by the priest of the village church. When he had drunk his coffee, the wife and daughter drew him aside into another room, and the wife complained that her husband had grown so old and decrepit that he could not keep up much longer."
secret-church,4,"Then she began to say that the schoolmaster was such a strong
and able man, and finally, that she and her daughter would like to
have him for priest, and whether he would not stay and succeed the old
father. The schoolmaster objected that he was no scholar. But they
insisted that he had more learning than was needed in their case, for
they never had any visits from the bishop, nor did the dean ever hold a
chapter, for of all such things they knew nothing. When the schoolmaster
heard that, he said that even though he had the necessary scholarship,
he doubted very much that he had the right vocation, and since this was
a most important matter for him and for them, it would be unwise to act
too hurriedly, so he would ask for a year to think it over. When he had
said that, he found himself standing by a pond in the wood, and could
see neither church nor parsonage."
secret-church,5,"So he thought the matter was at an end. But a year later, just as the term he had set was up, he was working on a house, for during the school vacation he busied himself either with fishing or carpentering. He was just straddling a wall when he saw the pastor's daughter, the one whom he had seen in the mountains, coming straight toward him. She asked him if he had thought over the matter. ""Yes,"" said he, ""I have thought it over, but I cannot; since I cannot answer for it before God and my own conscience."" That very moment the pastor's daughter from underground vanished; but immediately after he cut himself in the knee with the ax in such wise that he remained a cripple for life."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,1,"On a certain afternoon the sun was falling in the West, and in the midst
of the ruddy silence a solitary lodge stood on the banks of a remote
lake. One sound only broke, in the least degree, the forest
stillness. The low breathing of the dying inmate, who was the head of a
poor family. His wife and children surrounded the buffalo robe on which
he lay. Of the children, two were almost grown up--a daughter and a son. 
The other was a boy, and a mere child in years.

All the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted. They stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps,
awaiting the departure of the spirit. As one of the last acts of
kindness, the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the
fresh air of the evening. The poor man felt a momentary return of
strength, and raising himself a little, he addressed his family.

""I leave you,"" he said, ""in a world of care, in which it has required
all my strength and skill to supply you food, and to protect you from
the storms and cold of a harsh climate."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,2,"He cast his eyes upon his wife, and continued:

""For you, my partner in life, I have less sorrow, because I am persuaded
you will not remain long behind me. But you, my children! My poor and
forsaken children, who have just begun the career of life, who will
shelter you from calamity? Listen to my words. Unkindness, ingratitude,
and every wickedness, are in the scene before you. It was for this that
years ago I withdrew from my kindred and my tribe to spend my days in
this lonely spot. I have contented myself with the company of your
mother and yourselves, during seasons of very frequent scarcity and
want. Your kindred, feasting in plenty, have caused the forests to
echo with the shouts of successful war. I gave up these things for the
enjoyment of peace. I wished to hide you away from the bad examples
which would have spoiled your innocence. I have seen you, thus far, grow
up in purity of heart. If we have sometimes suffered bodily want, we
have escaped pain of mind. We have not been compelled to look on or to
take a part with the red hand in scenes of rioting and bloodshed. My
path now stops. I have arrived at the brink of the world. I will shut my
eyes in peace if you, my children, will promise me to cherish each
other. Let not your mother suffer during the few days that are left to
her. I charge you, on no account, to forsake your younger brother.
Of him I give you both my dying command to have a tender care."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,3,"He spoke no more, and as the sun fell out of view the light had gone
from his face. The family stood still, as if they expected to hear
something further. But when they came to his side and called him by
name, his spirit did not answer. It was in another world.

The mother and daughter lamented aloud, but the elder son clothed
himself in silence, as though it had been a mantle. He took his course
as though nothing had occurred. He exerted himself to supply, with his
bow and net, the wants of the little household, but he never made
mention of his father.

Five moons had filled and waned, and the sixth was near its full, when
the mother also died. In her last moments she pressed the fulfillment of
their father's wish."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,4,"The winter passed, and the spring, sparkling in the clear northern air,
cheered the spirits of the lonely little people in the lodge.

The girl, being the eldest, directed her brothers. She seemed to
feel a tender and sisterly affection for the youngest, who was slight in
frame and of a delicate temper. The other boy soon began to break forth
with restless speeches, which showed that his spirit was not at ease.
One day he addressed his sister as follows:

""My sister, are we always to live as if there were no other human beings
in the world? Must I deprive myself of the pleasure of mingling with my
own kind? I have determined this question for myself. I shall seek the
villages of men, and you can not prevent me."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,5,"The sister replied:

""I do not say no, my brother, to what you desire. We are not forbidden
the society of our fellow-mortals, but we are told to cherish each
other, and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little
household. Neither pleasure nor pain ought, therefore, to separate us,
especially from our younger brother, who, being but a child, and weakly
withal, is entitled to a double share of our affection. If we follow our
separate fancies, it will surely make us neglect him, whom we are bound
by vows, both to our father and mother, to support.""

The young man received this address in silence, and still took his
course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred. After
awhile he seemed to recover his spirits. As they lived in a large
country, where there were open fields, the two brothers, at his
invitation, often amused themselves in playing ball. One afternoon he
chose the ground near to a beautiful lake, and they played and laughed
with great spirit. The ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,6,"Now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old Manito, Mishosha
by name, who looked at the brothers as they played. He was vastly
pleased with their nimbleness and beauty. He thought to himself, what
shall I do to get these lads to accompany me? One of them shall hit the
ball sideways, and it shall fall into my canoe.

It so happened, and it somehow seemed as if Owasso, the elder brother,
had purposely given it that direction. When Owasso saw the old man, he
professed to be greatly surprised. As was the other, Sheem by name, in
truth, for he had not noticed the old Manito before.

""Bring the ball to us,"" they both cried out. ""Come to the shore.""

""No,"" answered the old magician. He, however, came near enough for
either of them to wade out to him. ""Come, come,"" he said. ""Come and get
your ball.""

They insisted that he should come ashore, but he sturdily declined to
oblige them."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,7,"""Very well,"" said Owasso, ""I will go and get it."" And he ran into the
water. ""Hand it to me,"" he said, when he had approached near enough to
receive it.

""Ha!"" answered the Manito, ""reach over and get it yourself.""

Owasso was about to grasp the ball, when the old magician suddenly
seized him and pushed him into the boat.

""My grandfather,"" said Owasso, ""pray take my little brother also. Alone
I can not go with you. He will starve if I leave him.""

Mishosha only laughed at him. Then uttering the charmed words, ""Chemaun
Poll!"" and giving his canoe a slap, it glided through the water, without
further help, with the swiftness of an arrow.

In a short time they reached the magician's lodge, which stood upon the
further shore, a little distance back from the lake. The two daughters
of Mishosha were seated within. ""My daughter,"" he said to his eldest, as
they entered the lodge, ""I have brought you a husband."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,8,"The young woman smiled. Owasso was a comely youth to look upon. The
magician told him to take his seat near her. By this act the
marriage ceremony was completed, and Owasso and the magician's daughter
were man and wife. In the course of time they had born to them a
son.

But no sooner was Owasso in the family than the old Manito wished him
out of the way. He went about in his own wicked fashion to compass
it.

One day he asked his son-in-law to go out a-fishing with him. They
started without delay. The magician had only to speak, and off went
the canoe. They reached a solitary bay in an island, a very dark,
lonely, and out-of-the-way place. The Manito advised Owasso to spear a
large sturgeon which came alongside, and with its great glassy eye
turned up, seemed to recognize the magician. Owasso rose in the boat to
dart his spear, and by speaking that moment to his canoe, Mishosha shot
forward and hurled his son-in-law headlong into the water. Leaving him to struggle for himself, he was soon out of sight."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,9,"Owasso, being himself gifted with limited magical powers, spoke to the
fish, and bade him swim toward the lodge, while he carried him along,
which he did at great speed. Once he directed the sturgeon to rise near
the surface of the water, so that he might, if possible, get a view of
the magician. The fish obeyed, and Owasso saw the wicked old Manito busy
in another direction, fishing, as unconcerned as though he had not just
lost a member of his family.

On went the fish, and on went Owasso, till they reached the shore, near
the magician's lodge, in advance of him. He then spoke kindly to the
sturgeon, and told him he should not be angry with him for having
speared him, as he was created to be meat for man. The sturgeon made no
reply, or if he did, it has not been reported. Owasso, drawing him
on shore, went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately. By
the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight.

""Your grandfather has arrived,"" said the woman to her son. ""Go and see
what he brings, and eat this as you go""--handing a piece of the fish.

The boy went, and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his
hand, than he asked him, ""What are you eating? and who brought it?"""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,10,"He replied, ""My father brought it.""

The magician began to feel uneasy, for he found that he had been
outwitted. He, however, put on a grave face, and entering the lodge,
acted as if nothing unusual had happened.

Some days after this, Mishosha again requested his son-in-law to
accompany him. Owasso, without hesitation, said ""Yes!""

They went out, and, in a rapid passage, they arrived at a solitary
island, which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks.

The magician said to Owasso, ""Go on shore, my son, and pick up all the
gulls' eggs you can find.""

The rocks were strewn with eggs, and the air resounded with the cry of
the birds as they saw them gathered up by Owasso.

The old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls. ""I have
long wished,"" he said, ""to offer you something. I now give you this
young man for food.""

He then uttered the charm to his canoe, and it shot out of sight,
leaving Owasso to make his peace the best way he could."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,11,"The gulls flew in immense numbers around him, and were ready to devour
him. Owasso did not lose his presence of mind, but he addressed them and
said:

""Gulls, you know you were not formed to eat human flesh, nor was man
made to be the prey of birds. Obey my words. Fly close together, a
sufficient number of you, and carry me on your backs to the magician's
lodge.""

They listened attentively to what he said, and seeing nothing
unreasonable in his request, they obeyed him. Owasso soon found
himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward.

Meanwhile, it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and
allowed his canoe to come to a stand-still. Owasso, in his flight
over the lake, saw him lying on his back in the boat, taking a nap,
which was quite natural, as the day was very soft and balmy."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,12,"As Owasso, with his convoy of birds, passed over, he let fall, directly
in the face of the old magician, a capful of gulls' eggs. They broke
and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see. He jumped up and
exclaimed:

""It is always so with these thoughtless birds. They never consider where
they drop their eggs.""

Owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety, and, excusing
himself for the liberty, he killed two or three of the gulls for the
sake of their feathers to ornament his son's head.

When the magician arrived, soon after, his grandson came out to meet
him, tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with
the wind.

""Where did you get these?"" asked the Manito, ""and who brought them?""

""My father brought them,"" the boy replied.

The old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not
destroyed his son-in-law. He entered his lodge in silence, and set his
wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings
in that respect."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,13,"He could not help saying to himself:

""What manner of boy is this who is ever escaping from my power? But his
guardian spirit shall not save him. I will entrap him to-morrow. Ha, ha,
ha!""

He was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without
effect, and that he had but two more left. He now professed to be more
friendly with his son-in-law than ever, and the very next day he said to
Owasso:

""Come, my son, you must go with me to procure some young eagles. We
will tame them, and have them for pets about the lodge. I have
discovered an island where they are in great abundance.""

They started on the trip. When, after traversing an immense waste of
water, they had reached the island, Mishosha led him inland until they
came to the foot of a tall pine-tree, upon which the nests were to be
found.

""Now, my son,"" said Mishosha, ""climb up this tree and bring down the
birds. I think you will get some fine ones up there.""

Owasso obeyed. When he had with great difficulty got near the nest,
Mishosha cried out, addressing himself to the tree, and without much
regard to the wishes of Owasso:

""Now stretch yourself up and be very tall."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,14,"The tree, at this bidding, rose up so far that Owasso would have
imperiled his neck by any attempt to get to the ground.

""Listen, ye eagles!"" continued Mishosha. ""You have long expected a gift
from me. I now present you this boy, who has had the presumption to
climb up where you are to molest your young. Stretch forth your claws
and seize him.""

So saying, the old magician, according to his custom in such cases,
turned his back upon Owasso. Going off in his canoe at a word, he
left his son-in-law to shift for himself.

But the birds did not seem to be so badly-minded as the old magician had
supposed. a very old bald eagle, quite corpulent and large of limb,
alighting on a branch just opposite, opened conversation with him by
asking what had brought him there.

Owasso replied that he had not mounted the tree of himself, or out of
any disposition to harm his people. his father-in-law, the old
magician who had just left them, had sent him up. He was constantly
sending him on mischievous errands. In a word, the young man was
enlarging at great length upon the character of the wicked Manito. He was interrupted by being darted upon by a hungry-eyed bird, with long
claws.

Owasso, not in the least disconcerted, boldly seized this fierce eagle
by the neck and dashed it against the rocks, crying out:

""Thus will I deal with all who come near me."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,15,"The old eagle, who appeared to be the head of the tribe, was so pleased
with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds,
uncommonly strong in the wings, to transport Owasso to his lodge. They
were to take turns in conducting him through the air.

Owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness, and
they forthwith set out. It was a high point from which they started, for
the pine-tree had shot far, far up toward the clouds, and they could
even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived, though it
was miles and miles away. For this point they steered their flight. In a short time they landed Owasso at the door of the lodge.

With many compliments for their dispatch, Owasso dismissed the birds,
and stood ready to greet his wicked father-in-law who now arrived. When he espied his son-in-law still unharmed, Mishosha grew very black
in the face. He had but a single charm left."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,16,"He thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best
advantage. It happened that while he was doing so, one evening, as
Owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake, and the soft
breeze swept over it, they heard a song, as if sung by some one at a
great distance. The sound continued for some time, and then died away in
perfect stillness. ""Oh, it is the voice of Sheem,"" cried Owasso. ""It is
the voice of my brother! If I could but only see him!"" And he hung down
his head in deep anguish.

His wife witnessed his distress, and to comfort him she proposed that
they should attempt to make their escape, and carry him succor on the
morrow.

When the morning came, and the sun shone warmly into the lodge, the wife
of Owasso offered to comb her father's hair, with the hope that it
would soothe him to sleep. It had that effect. They no sooner saw
him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe, Owasso uttered the
charmed words, ""Chemaun Poll!"" and they glided away upon the water
without need of oar or sail."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,17,"They had nearly reached the land on the opposite side of the lake, and
could distinctly hear the voice of the younger brother singing his
lament as before, when the old magician wakened. Missing his daughter
and her husband, he suspected deception of some kind. He looked for his
magic boat and found it gone. He spoke the magic words, which were more
powerful from him than from any other person in the world, and the canoe
immediately returned; to the sore disappointment of Owasso and his wife.

When they came back to the shore, Mishosha stood upon the beach and drew
up his canoe. He did not utter a word. The son-in-law and daughter
entered the lodge in silence.

The time, walking along in its broad open path, brought the autumn
months to a close, and the winter had set in. Soon after the first fall
of snow, Owasso said:

""Father, I wish to try my skill in hunting. It is said there is plenty
of game not far off, and it can now be easily tracked. Let us go."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,18,"The magician consented. They set out, and arriving at a good ground for
their sport, they spent the day in hunting. Night coming on, they built
themselves a lodge of pine-branches to sleep in. Although it was
bitterly cold, the young man took off his leggings and moccasins, and
hung them up to dry. The old magician did the same, carefully hanging
his own in a separate place, and they lay down to sleep.

Owasso, from a glance he had given, suspected that the magician had a
mind to play him a trick. To be ahead of  him, he watched an
opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings, putting his
own in the place of Mishosha's, and depending on the darkness of the
lodge to help him through.

Near daylight, the old magician bestirred himself, as if to rekindle the
fire. He slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a
stick, and thinking they were no other than those of Owasso's, he
dropped them into the flames. He cast himself down, and affected
to be lost in a heavy sleep. The leather leggings and moccasins soon
drew up and were burned."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,19,"Instantly jumping up and rubbing his eyes, Mishosha cried out:

""Son-in-law, your moccasins are burning. I know it by the smell.""

Owasso rose up, deliberately and unconcerned.

""No, my friend,"" said he, ""here are mine,"" at the same time taking them
down and drawing them on. ""It is your moccasins that are burning.""

Mishosha dropped his head upon his breast. All his tricks were played
out--there was not so much as half a one left to help him out of the
sorry plight he was in.

""I believe, my grandfather,"" added Owasso, ""that this is the moon in
which fire attracts. I fear you must have set your foot and leg
garments too near the fire, and they have been drawn in. Now let us go
forth to the hunt.""

The old magician was compelled to follow him, and they pushed out into a
great storm of snow, and hail, and wind, which had come on over night.
Neither the wind, the hail, nor the snow, had the slightest respect
for the bare limbs of the old magician, for there was not the least
virtue of magic in those parts of old Mishosha's body. After a while
they quite stiffened under him, his body became hard, and the hair
bristled in the cold wind, so that he looked to Owasso--who turned away
from him, leaving the wicked old magician alone to ponder upon his past
life. To Owasso he looked like a tough old sycamore-tree more than a
highly-gifted old magician."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,20,"Owasso himself reached home in safety, proof against all kinds of
weather, and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young
man and his wife.

During all this part of Owasso's stay at the lodge of Mishosha, his
sister, whom he had left on the main land with Sheem, their younger
brother, had labored with good-will to supply the lodge. She knew enough
of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food. She watched
her little brother, and tended his wants, with all of a good sister's
care. By times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge. No
one came to be a witness of her constancy, or to let fall a single word
in her mother-tongue. She could not converse with the birds and beasts
about her, and she felt, to the bottom of her heart, that she was alone.
In these thoughts she forgot her younger brother. She almost wished him
dead; for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship
of others.

One day, after collecting all the provisions she had been able to
reserve from their daily use, and bringing a supply of wood to the door,
she said to her little brother:

""My brother, you must not stray from the lodge. I am going to seek our
elder brother. I shall be back soon."""
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,21,"She then set the lodge in perfect order, and, taking her bundle, she set
off in search of habitations. These she soon found, and in the enjoyment
of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance, she began to
think less and less of her little brother, Sheem. She accepted proposals
of marriage, and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy.

As for poor little Sheem, he was soon brought to the pinching turn of
his fate. As soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge, he
was obliged to pick berries, and live off of such roots as he could dig
with his slender hands. As he wandered about in search of wherewithal to
stay his hunger, he often looked up to heaven, and saw the gray clouds
going up and down. And then he looked about upon the wide earth, but he
never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay.

At last, even the roots and berries gave out. They were blighted by the
frost or hidden out of reach by the snow, for the mid-winter had come
on, and poor little Sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away
in search of food."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,22,"Sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees
or caverns, and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage
wolves.

These at last became his only resource, and he grew to be so little
fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured
their meat, and patiently await his share.

After a while, the wolves took to little Sheem very kindly, and seeming
to understand his outcast condition, they would always leave something
for him to eat. By and by they began to talk with him, and to inquire
into his history. When he told them that he had been forsaken by his
brother and his sister, the wolves turned about to each other, lifted up
their eyes to heaven, and wondered among themselves, with raised paws,
that such a thing should have been.

In this way, Sheem lived on till the spring, and as soon as the lake was
free from ice, he followed his new friends to the shore."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,23,"It happened on the same day, that his elder brother, Owasso, was fishing
in his magic canoe, a considerable distance out upon the lake. He
thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore. He wondered how
any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast.

He listened again with all attention, and he heard the cry distinctly
repeated. This time it was the well-known cry of his younger brother
that reached his ear. He knew too well the secret of his song, as he
heard him chaunting mournfully:

""My brother! My brother! Since you left me going in the canoe, a-hee-ee,
I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf,
E-wee.""

Owasso made for the shore, and as he approached the lament was repeated.
The sounds were very distinct, and the voice of wailing was very
sorrowful for Owasso to listen to. It touched him the more that it
died away at the close, into a long-drawn howl, like that of the wolf."
sheem-the-forsaken-boy,24,"In the sand, as he drew closer to the land, he saw the tracks as of that
animal fleeing away; and besides these the prints of human hands. But
what were the pity and astonishment that smote Owasso to the heart when
he espied his poor little brother--poor little forsaken Sheem--half boy
and half wolf, flying along the shore.

Owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his
arms, saying soothingly, ""My brother! my brother! Come to me.""

But the poor wolf-boy avoided his grasp, crying, as he fled, ""Neesia,
neesia. Since you left me going in the canoe, a-he-ee, I am half changed
into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee!"" and howling
between these words of lament.

The elder brother, sore at heart, and feeling all of his brotherly
affection strongly returning, with renewed anguish, cried out, ""My
brother! my brother! my brother!""

But the nearer he approached to poor Sheem, the faster he fled, and the
more rapidly the change went on. The boy-wolf by turns singing and
howling, and calling out the name, first of his brother and then of his
sister, till the change was complete. He leaped upon a bank, and looking
back, and casting upon Owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief, he
exclaimed, ""I am a wolf!"" and disappeared in the woods."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,1,"The compass, with its needle always pointing to the North, is quite a common thing. No one thinks that it is remarkable now, though when it was first invented it must have been a wonder.

Now long ago in China, there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha. This was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the South. No matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the South."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,2,"This curious instrument was invented by Kotei, one of the three Chinese Emperors of the Mythological age. Kotei was the son of the Emperor Yuhi. Before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man.

One summer evening she went out to walk in the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star-lit heavens above her. As she looked at the North Star, strange to relate, it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction. Soon after this her son Kotei came into the world."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,3,"Kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the Emperor Yuhi. His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu. This rebel wanted to make himself King, and many were the battles which he fought to this end. Shiyu was a wicked magician, his head was made of iron, and there was no man that could conquer him.

At last Kotei declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle, and the two armies met on a plain called Takuroku. The Emperor boldly attacked the enemy, but the magician brought down a dense fog upon the battlefield. While the royal army were wandering about in confusion, trying to find their way, Shiyu retreated with his troops, laughing at having fooled the royal army."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,4,"No matter however strong and brave the Emperor's soldiers were, the rebel with his magic could always escape in the end.

Kotei returned to his Palace, and thought and pondered deeply as to how he should conquer the magician, for he was determined not to give up yet. After a long time he invented the shinansha with the figure of a man always pointing South, for there were no compasses in those days. With this instrument to show him the way he need not fear the dense fogs raised up by the magician to confound his men.

Kotei again declared war against Shiyu. He placed the shinansha in front of his army and led the way to the battlefield."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,5,"The battle began in earnest. The rebel was being driven backward by the royal troops when he again resorted to magic. Upon his saying some strange words in a loud voice, immediately a dense fog came down upon the battlefield.

But this time no soldier minded the fog, not one was confused. Kotei by pointing to the shinansha could find his way and directed the army without a single mistake. He closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river. This river Kotei and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,6,"Shiyu by using his magic art quickly passed over with his army and shut himself up in a fortress on the opposite bank.

When Kotei found his march checked he was wild with disappointment, for he had very nearly overtaken the rebel when the river stopped him.

He could do nothing, for there were no boats in those days, so the Emperor ordered his tent to be pitched in the pleasantest spot that the place afforded."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,7,"One day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond. Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought.

It was autumn. The trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves, which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond. By and by, Kotei's attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of the water. The little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by. It did so at last, and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,8,"This little incident made the clever Emperor think that he might try to make something that could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over the spider. He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat. When he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more, and in time there were enough boats for the whole army.

Kotei now took his army across the river, and attacked Shiyu's headquarters. He gained a complete victory, and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,9,"This wise and good Emperor did not rest till he had secured peace and prosperity throughout his whole land. He was beloved by his subjects, who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for many long years under him. He spent a great deal of time in making inventions which would benefit his people, and he succeeded in many besides the boat and the South Pointing shinansha.

He had reigned about a hundred years when one day, as Kotei was looking upwards, the sky became suddenly red, and something came glittering like gold towards the earth. As it came nearer Kotei saw that it was a great Dragon. The Dragon approached and bowed down its head before the Emperor. The Empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,10,"But the Emperor only smiled and called to them to stop, and said:

""Do not be afraid. This is a messenger from Heaven. My time here is finished!"" He then mounted the Dragon, which began to ascend towards the sky.

When the Empress and the courtiers saw this they all cried out together:

""Wait a moment! We wish to come too."" And they all ran and caught hold of the Dragon's beard and tried to mount him."
shinansha-or-south-pointing-carriage,11,"But it was impossible for so many people to ride on the Dragon. Several of them hung on to the creature's beard so that when it tried to mount the hair was pulled out and they fell to the ground.

Meanwhile the Empress and a few of the courtiers were safely seated on the Dragon's back. The Dragon flew up so high in the heavens that in a short time the inmates of the Palace, who had been left behind disappointed, could see them no more.

After some time a bow and an arrow dropped to the earth in the courtyard of the Palace. They were recognized as having belonged to the Emperor Kotei. The courtiers took them up carefully and preserved them as sacred relics in the Palace."
silverwhite-lillwacker,1,"Once upon a time there was a king, who had a queen that he loved with
a great love. But after a time the queen died, and all he had left was
an only daughter. And now that the king was a widower, his whole heart
went out to the little princess. He cherished her as the apple of his
eye. And the king's young daughter grew up into the most lovely maiden
ever known."
silverwhite-lillwacker,2,"When the princess had seen the snows of fifteen winters, it happened
that a great war broke out. Her father had to march against
the foe."
silverwhite-lillwacker,3,"But there was no one to whom the king could entrust his daughter while
he was away at war. So he had a great tower built out in the forest,
provided it with a plentiful store of supplies. In it he shut up his
daughter and a maid. And he had it proclaimed that every man, no
matter who he might be, was forbidden to approach the tower in which
he had placed his daughter and the maid, under pain of death."
silverwhite-lillwacker,4,"Now the king thought he had taken every precaution to protect his
daughter, and went off to war. In the meantime the princess and her
maid sat in the tower. But in the city there were a number of brave
young sons of kings, as well as other young men, who would have liked
to have talked to the beautiful maiden. And when they found that this
was forbidden them, they conceived a great hatred for the king. At
length they took counsel with an old woman who was wiser than most
folk. They told her to arrange matters in such wise that the king's
daughter and her maid might come into disrepute, without their having
anything to do with it. The old hag promised to help them, enchanted
some apples, laid them in a basket, and went to the lonely tower in
which the maidens lived."
silverwhite-lillwacker,5,"When the king's daughter and her maid saw the old woman, who was
sitting beneath the window, they felt a great longing to try the
beautiful apples.

So they called out and asked how much she wanted for her precious
apples. The old woman said they were not for sale. Yet as the
girls kept on pleading with her, the old woman said she would make
each of them a present of an apple. They only need let down a little
basket from the tower. The princess and her maid, in all innocence,
did as the troll-woman told them, and each received an apple. But the
enchanted fruit had a strange effect, for in due course of time heaven
sent them each a child. The king's daughter called her son
Silverwhite, and the son of her maid received the name of Lillwacker."
silverwhite-lillwacker,6,"The two boys grew up larger and stronger than other children, and were
very handsome as well. They looked as much alike as one cherry-pit
does to another. One could easily see that they were related."
silverwhite-lillwacker,7,"Seven years had passed, and the king was expected home from the war.
Then both girls were terrified, and they took counsel together as to
how they might hide their children. When at length they could find no
other way out of the difficulty, they very sorrowfully bade their
children farewell. They let them down from the tower at night, to seek
their fortune in the wide, wide world. At parting the king's daughter
gave Silverwhite a costly knife. The maid had nothing to give her
son."
silverwhite-lillwacker,8,"The two foster-brethren now wandered out into the world. After they
had gone a while, they came to a dark forest. And in this forest they
met a man, strange-looking and very tall. He wore two swords at his
side, and was accompanied by six great dogs. He gave them a friendly
greeting:

""Good-day, little fellows, from where do you come and to where do you go?""
The boys told him they came from a high tower, and were going out into
the world to seek their fortune. The man replied:

""If such be the case, I know more about your origin than any one else.
And that you may have something by which to remember your father, I
will give each of you a sword and three dogs. But you must promise me
one thing, that you will never part from your dogs; but take them with
you wherever you go."" The boys thanked the man for his kind gifts, and
promised to do as he had told them. Then they bade him farewell and
went their way."
silverwhite-lillwacker,9,"When they had traveled for some time they reached a cross-road. Then
Silverwhite said:

""It seems to me that it would be the best for us to try our luck
singly, so let us part."" Lillwacker answered: ""Your advice is good,
but how am I to know whether or not you are doing well out in the
world?""

""I will give you a token by which you may tell,"" said Silverwhite, ""so
long as the water runs clear in this spring you will know that I am
alive. If it turns red and roiled, it will mean that I am dead.""
Silverwhite then drew runes in the water of the spring, said farewell
to his brother, and each of them went on alone. Lillwacker soon came
to a king's court, and took service there, but every morning he would
go to the spring to see how his brother fared."
silverwhite-lillwacker,10,"Silverwhite continued to wander over hill and dale, until he reached a
great city. But the whole city was in mourning, the houses were hung
in black, and all the inhabitants went about full of grief and care,
as though some great misfortune had occurred."
silverwhite-lillwacker,11,"Silverwhite went though the city and inquired as to the cause of all
the unhappiness he saw. They answered: ""You must have come from far
away, since you do not know that the king and queen were in danger of
being drowned at sea. He had to promise to give up their three
daughters in order to escape. To-morrow morning the sea-troll is
coming to carry off the oldest princess."" This news pleased
Silverwhite, for he saw a fine opportunity to wealth and fame, should
fortune favor him."
silverwhite-lillwacker,12,"The next morning Silverwhite hung his sword at his side, called his
dogs to him, and wandered down to the sea-shore alone. And as he sat
on the strand he saw the king's daughter led out of the city. With
her went a courtier, who had promised to rescue her. But the princess
was very sad and cried bitterly. Then Silverwhite stepped up to her
with a polite greeting. When the king's daughter and her escort saw
the fearless youth, they were much frightened, because they thought he
was the sea-troll. The courtier was so alarmed that he ran away and
took refuge in a tree. When Silverwhite saw how frightened the
princess was, he said: ""Lovely maiden, do not fear me, for I will do
you no harm."""
silverwhite-lillwacker,13,"The king's daughter answered:

""Are you the troll who is coming to carry me away?"" ""No,"" said
Silverwhite, ""I have come to rescue you."" Then the princess was glad
to think that such a brave hero was going to defend her, and they
had a long, friendly talk. At the same time Silverwhite begged the
king's daughter to comb his hair. She complied with his request, and
Silverwhite laid his head in her lap. When he did so the princess
drew a golden ring from her finger and, unbeknown to him, wound it
into his locks."
silverwhite-lillwacker,14,"Suddenly the sea-troll rose from the deeps, setting the waves whirling
and foaming far and near. When the troll saw Silverwhite, he grew
angry and said: ""Why do you sit there beside my princess?"" The youth
replied: ""It seems to me that she is my princess, not yours."" The
sea-troll answered: ""Time enough to see which of us is right; but
first our dogs shall fight."" Silverwhite was nothing loath, and set
his dogs at the dogs of the troll. There was a fierce struggle.
But at last the youth's dogs got the upper hand and bit the dogs of
the sea-troll to death. Then Silverwhite drew his sword with a great
sweep, rushed upon the sea-troll, and gave him such a tremendous blow
that the monster's head rolled on the sand. The troll gave a fearsome
cry, and flung himself back into the sea, so that the water spurted to
the very skies. Thereupon the youth drew out his silver-mounted knife,
cut out the troll's eyes and put them in his pocket. Then he saluted
the lovely princess and went away."
silverwhite-lillwacker,15,"Now when the battle was over and the youth had disappeared, the
courtier crawled down from his tree, and threatened to kill the
princess if she did not say before all the people that he, and none
other, had rescued her. The king's daughter did not dare refuse, since
she feared for her life. So she returned to her father's castle with
the courtier, where they were received with great distinction.

And joy reigned throughout the land when the news spread that the
oldest princess had been rescued from the troll."
silverwhite-lillwacker,16,"On the following day everything repeated itself. Silverwhite went down
to the strand and met the second princess, just as she was to be
delivered to the troll.

And when the king's daughter and her escort saw him, they were very
much frightened, thinking he was the sea-troll. And the courtier
climbed a tree, just as he had before. The princess granted the
youth's petition, combed his hair as her sister had done, and also
wound her gold ring into his long curls."
silverwhite-lillwacker,17,"After a time there was a great tumult out at sea, and a sea-troll rose
from the waves. He had three heads and three dogs. But Silverwhite's
dogs overcame those of the troll, and the youth killed the troll
himself with his sword. Thereupon he took out his silver-mounted
knife, cut out the troll's eyes, and went his way. But the courtier
lost no time. He climbed down from his tree and forced the princess
to promise to say that he, and none other, had rescued her. Then they
returned to the castle, where the courtier was acclaimed as the
greatest of heroes."
silverwhite-lillwacker,18,"On the third day Silverwhite hung his sword at his side, called his
three dogs to him, and again wandered down to the sea-shore. As he was
sitting by the strand, he saw the youngest princess led out of the
city, and with her the daring courtier who claimed to have rescued her
sisters. But the princess was very sad and cried bitterly. Then
Silverwhite stepped up and greeted the lovely maiden politely. Now
when the king's daughter and her escort saw the handsome youth, they
were very much frightened, for they believed him to be the sea-troll.
The courtier ran away and hid in a high tree that grew near the
strand."
silverwhite-lillwacker,19,"When Silverwhite noticed the maiden's terror, he said:

""Lovely maiden, do not fear me, for I will do you no harm."" The king's
daughter answered: ""Are you the troll who is coming to carry me away?""
""No,"" said Silverwhite, ""I have come to rescue you."" Then the princess
was very glad to have such a brave hero fight for her, and they had a
long, friendly talk with each other. At the same time Silverwhite
begged the lovely maiden to do him a favor and comb his hair. This the
king's daughter was most willing to do, and Silverwhite laid his head
in her lap. But when the princess saw the gold rings her sisters had
wound in his locks, she was much surprised, and added her own to the
others."
silverwhite-lillwacker,20,"Suddenly the sea-troll came shooting up out of the deep with a
terrific noise, so that waves and foam spurted to the very skies. This
time the monster had six heads and nine dogs. When the troll saw
Silverwhite sitting with the king's daughter, he fell into a rage and
cried: ""What are you doing with my princess?"" The youth answered: ""It
seems to me that she is my princess rather than yours."" Thereupon the
troll said: ""Time enough to see which of us is right; but first our
dogs shall fight each other."" Silverwhite did not delay, but set his
dogs at the sea-dogs, and they had a battle royal. But in the end the
youth's dogs got the upper hand and bit all nine of the sea-dogs to
death. Finally Silverwhite drew out his bare sword, flung himself upon
the sea-troll, and stretched all six of his heads on the sand with a
single blow. The monster uttered a terrible cry, and rushed back into
the sea so that the water spurted to the heavens. Then the youth drew
his silver-mounted knife, cut out all twelve of the troll's eyes,
saluted the king's young daughter, and hastily went away."
silverwhite-lillwacker,21,"Now that the battle was over, and the youth had disappeared, the
courtier climbed down from his tree, drew his sword and threatened to
kill the princess unless she promised to say that he had rescued her
from the troll, as he had her sisters.

The king's daughter did not dare refuse, since she feared for her
life. So they went back to the castle together, and when the king saw
that they had returned in safety, without so much as a scratch, he and
the whole court were full of joy, and they were accorded great honors.
And at court the courtier was quite another fellow from the one who
had hid away in the tree. The king had a splendid banquet prepared,
with amusements and games, and the sound of string music and dancing.
He bestowed the hand of his youngest daughter on the courtier in
reward for his bravey."
silverwhite-lillwacker,22,"In the midst of the wedding festivities, when the king and his whole
court were seated at table, the door opened, and in came Silverwhite
with his dogs.

The youth stepped boldly into the hall of state and greeted the king.
And when the three princesses saw who it was, they were full of joy,
leaped up from their places, and ran over to him, much to the king's
surprise, who asked what it all meant. Then the youngest princess told
him all that had happened, from beginning to end, and that Silverwhite
had rescued them, while the courtier sat in a tree. To prove it beyond
any chance of doubt, each of the king's daughters showed her father
the ring she had wound in Silverwhite's locks. But the king still did
not know quite what to think of it all, until Silverwhite said: ""My
lord king! In order that you need not doubt what your daughters have
told you, I will show you the eyes of the sea-trolls whom I slew.""
Then the king and all the rest saw that the princesses had told the
truth. The traitorous courtier received his just punishment.
Silverwhite was paid every honor, and was given the youngest daughter
and half of the kingdom with her."
silverwhite-lillwacker,23,"One night, when all were sleeping, it chanced that he heard a knocking
at the window, and a voice which said: ""Come, Silverwhite, I have to
talk to you!"" The king, who did not want to wake his young wife, rose
hastily, girded on his sword, called his dogs and went out. When he
reached the open air, there stood a huge and savage-looking troll. The
troll said: ""Silverwhite, you have slain my three brothers, and I have
come to bid you go down to the sea-shore with me, that we may fight
with one another."" This proposal suited the youth, and he followed the
troll without protest. When they reached the sea-shore, there lay
three great dogs belonging to the troll. Silverwhite at once set his
dogs at the troll-dogs. After a hard struggle the latter had to
give in. The young king drew his sword, bravely attacked the troll and
dealt him many a mighty blow. It was a tremendous battle."
silverwhite-lillwacker,24,"But when the troll noticed he was getting the worst of it, he grew frightened,
quickly ran to a high tree, and clambered into it. Silverwhite and the
dogs ran after him, the dogs barking as loudly as they could. Then the
troll begged for his life and said: ""Dear Silverwhite, I will take
wergild for my brothers, only bid your dogs be still, so that we may
talk."" The king bade his dogs be still, but in vain, they only barked
the more loudly. Then the troll tore three hairs from his head, handed
them to Silverwhite and said: ""Lay a hair on each of the dogs, and
then they will be as quiet as can be."" The king did so and at once the
dogs fell silent, and lay motionless as though they had grown fast to
the ground. Now Silverwhite realized that he had been deceived; but it
was too late. The troll was already descending from the tree, and he
drew his sword and again began to fight. But they had exchanged no
more than a few blows, before Silverwhite received a mortal wound, and
lay on the earth in a pool of blood."
silverwhite-lillwacker,25,"But now we must tell about Lillwacker. The next morning he went to the
spring by the cross-road and found it red with blood. Then he knew
that Silverwhite was dead. He called his dogs, hung his sword at his
side, and went on until he came to a great city. And the city was in
festal array, the streets were crowded with people, and the houses
were hung with scarlet cloths and splendid rugs. Lillwacker asked why
everybody was so happy, and they said: ""You must hail from distant
parts, since you do not know that a famous hero has come here by the
name of Silverwhite. He has rescued our three princesses, and is now
the king's son-in-law."" Lillwacker then inquired how it had all come
about, and then went his way, reaching the royal castle in which
Silverwhite dwelt with his beautiful queen in the evening."
silverwhite-lillwacker,26,"When Lillwacker entered the castle gate, all greeted him as though he
had been the king. For he resembled his foster-brother so closely that
none could tell one from the other. When the youth came to the queen's
room, she also took him for Silverwhite. She went up to him and said:
""My lord king, where have you been so long? I have been awaiting you
with great anxiety."" Lillwacker said little, and was very taciturn.
Then he lay down on a couch in a corner of the queen's room."
silverwhite-lillwacker,27,"The young woman did not know what to think of his actions. Her
husband did not act queerly at other times. But she thought: ""One
should not try to discover the secrets of others,"" and said nothing."
silverwhite-lillwacker,28,"In the night, when all were sleeping, there was a knocking at the
window, and a voice cried: ""Come, Lillwacker, I have to talk to you!""
The youth rose hastily, took his good sword, called his dogs and
went. When he reached the open air, there stood the same troll who had
slain Silverwhite. He said: ""Come with me, Lillwacker, and then you
shall see your foster-brother!"" To this Lillwacker at once agreed, and
the troll led the way. When they came to the sea-shore, there lay the
three great dogs whom the troll had brought with him. Somewhat further
away, where they had fought, lay Silverwhite in a pool of blood, and
beside him his dogs were stretched out on the ground as though they
had taken root in it. Then Lillwacker saw how everything had happened,
and thought that he would gladly venture his life, if he might in some
way call his brother back from the dead. He at once set his dogs at
the troll-dogs, and they had a hard struggle, in which Lillwacker's
dogs won the victory. Then the youth drew his sword, and attacked the
troll with mighty blows. But when the troll saw that he was getting
the worst of it, he took refuge in a lofty tree. Lillwacker and his
dogs ran after him and the dogs barked loudly."
silverwhite-lillwacker,29,"Then the troll humbly begged for his life, and said: ""Dear Lillwacker,
I will give you wergild for your brother, only bid your dogs be still,
so that we may talk."" At the same time the troll handed him three
hairs from his head and added: ""Lay one of these hairs on each of your
dogs, and then they will soon be quiet."" But Lillwacker saw through
his cunning scheme, took the three hairs and laid them on the
troll-dogs, which at once fell on the ground and lay like dead."
silverwhite-lillwacker,30,"When the troll saw that his attempt had failed, he was much alarmed
and said: ""Dearest Lillwacker, I will give you wergild for your
brother, if you will only leave me alone."" But the youth answered:

""What is there you can give me that will compensate for my brother's
life?"" The troll replied: ""Here are two flasks. In one is a liquid
which, if you anoint a dead man with it, it will restore him to life.
As to the liquid in the other flask, if you moisten anything with
it, and some one touches the place you have moistened, he will be
unable to move from the spot. I think it would be hard to find
anything more precious than the liquid in these flasks."""
silverwhite-lillwacker,31,"Lillwacker said: ""Your proposal suits me, and I will accept it. But there is
something else you must promise to do: that you will release my
brother's dogs."" The troll agreed, climbed down from the tree,
breathed on the dogs and thus freed them. Then Lillwacker took the two
flasks and went away from the sea-shore with the troll. After they had
gone a while they came to a great flat stone, lying near the highway.
Lillwacker hastened on in advance and moistened it with liquid from
the second flask. Then, as he was going by, Lillwacker suddenly set
all six of his dogs at the troll, who stepped back and touched the
stone. There he stuck, and could move neither forward nor backward.
After a time the sun rose and shone on the stone. And when the troll
saw the sun he burst--and was as dead as a doornail!"
silverwhite-lillwacker,32,"Lillwacker now ran back to his brother and sprinkled him with the
liquid in the other flask, so that he came to life again, and they
were both very happy, as may well be imagined. The two foster-brothers
then returned to the castle, recounting the story of their experiences
and adventures on the way. Lillwacker told how he had been taken for
his brother. He even mentioned that he had lain down on a couch in a
corner of the queen's room, and that she had never suspected that he
was not her rightful husband. But when Silverwhite heard that, he
thought that Lillwacker had offended against the queen's dignity, and
he grew angry and fell into such a rage that he drew his sword, and
thrust it into his brother's breast. Lillwacker fell to earth dead,
and Silverwhite went home to the castle alone. But Lillwacker's dogs
would not leave their master, and lay around him, whining and licking
his wound."
silverwhite-lillwacker,33,"In the evening, when the young king and his wife retired, the queen
asked him why he had been so taciturn and serious the evening before.
Then the queen said: ""I am very curious to know what has befallen you
during the last few days, but what I would like to know most of all,
is why you lay down on a couch in a corner of my room the other
night?"" Now it was clear to Silverwhite that the brother he had slain
was innocent of all offense, and he felt bitter regret at having
repaid his faithfulness so badly. So King Silverwhite at once rose and
went to the place where his brother was lying. He poured the water of
life from his flask and anointed his brother's wound. In a moment
Lillwacker was alive again, and the two brother's went joyfully back
to the castle."
silverwhite-lillwacker,34,"When they got there, Silverwhite told his queen how Lillwacker had
rescued him from death, and all the rest of their adventures, and all
were happy at the royal court. They paid the youth the greatest
honors and compliments. After he had stayed there a time he sued for
the hand of the second princess and obtained it. Thereupon the wedding
was celebrated with great pomp, and Silverwhite divided his half of
the kingdom with his foster-brother. The two brothers continued to
live together in peace and unity, and if they have not died, they are
living still."
skalunda-giant,1,"In the Skalunda mountain, near the church, there once lived a giant in the early days, who no longer felt comfortable after the church had been built there. He decided that he could no longer stand the ringing of the church bells; so he emigrated and settled down on an island far out in the North Sea. Once upon a time a ship was wrecked on this island, and among those saved were several people from Skalunda."
skalunda-giant,2,"""From where do you hail?"" asked the giant, who by now had grown old and blind, and sat warming himself before a log fire.

""We are from Skalunda,"" said one of the men saved.

""Give me your hand, so that I may feel whether there is still warm blood to be found in the Swedish land,"" said the giant."
skalunda-giant,3,"The man, who feared to shake hands with the giant, drew a red-hot bar of iron from the fire and handed it to him. He seized it firmly, and pressed it so hard that the molten iron ran down between his fingers."
skalunda-giant,4,"""Yes, there is still warm blood to be found in Sweden,"" said he. ""And tell me,"" he continued, ""is Skalunda mountain still standing?""

""No, the hens have scratched it away,"" the man answered.

""How could it last?"" said the giant. ""My wife and daughter piled it up in the course of a single Sunday morning. But surely the Hallenberg and the Hunneberg are still standing, for those I built myself."""
skalunda-giant,5,"When the man had confirmed this, the giant wanted to know whether Karin was still living in Stommen. And when they told him that she was, he gave them a girdle, and with it the message that Karin was to wear it in remembrance of him."
skalunda-giant,6,"The men took the girdle and gave it to Karin upon their return home. But before Karin put it on, she clasped it around the oak-tree that grew in the court. No sooner had she done so than the oak tore itself out of the ground, and flew to the North, borne away by the storm-wind. In the place where it had stood was a deep pit, and the roots of the tree were so enormous that one of the best springs in Stommen flows from one of the root-holes to this very day."
skipper-and-sir-urian,1,"Once upon a time there was a master mariner who had the most unheard of
good fortune in all that he undertook; none had such splendid cargoes,
and none earned so much money as he did, for everything seemed to come
to him. And it is quite certain that there were none who could risk
taking the trips he did, for wherever he sailed he had fair winds, yes,
it was even said that when he turned around his cap, the wind turned
with it, to suit his wish.

Thus he sailed for many years with cargoes of lumber, and even went as
far as China, and earned money like hay. But once he sailed the North
Sea with all sails set, as though he had stolen ship and cargo. But the
one who was after him sailed even more swiftly. And that was Sir Urian,
the devil! With him the master mariner, as you may imagine, had made
a bargain, and that very day and hour the contract expired, and the
mariner had to be prepared, from moment to moment, to see him arrive to
fetch him."
skipper-and-sir-urian,2,"So he came up on deck, out of the cabin, and took a look at the weather.
Then he called the ship's carpenter and several others, and told them to
go down at once into the ship's hold, and bore two holes in the ship's
bottom. Then they were to take the pumps from out their frames, and set
them closely over the holes, so that the water would rise quite high in
the pipes.

The men were surprised, and thought his orders passing strange, yet they
did as he told them. They bored the holes, and set up the pumps closely
over them, so that not even a drop of water could get at the cargo; yet
the North Sea stood seven feet high in the pumps."
skipper-and-sir-urian,3,"No more had they cast overboard their chips and litter than Sir Urian
came along in a squall, and grabbed the master mariner by the collar.
""Wait, old boy, the matter is not so terribly urgent!"" said he, and
began to defend himself, and pry loose the claws that held him with an
awl. ""Did you not bind yourself in your contract always to keep my ship
tight and dry?"" said the master mariner. ""You are a nice article! Just
take a look at the pumps! The water stands seven feet high in the pipes!
Pump, devil, pump my ship dry, then you may take me to have and to hold
as long as ever you wish!""

The devil was fool enough, and allowed himself to be hoaxed. He worked
and sweat, and the perspiration ran down his cheeks in such streams that
one might have run a mill with them, but he merely kept on pumping out
of the North Sea into the North Sea. At last he had enough of it, and
when he could pump no longer, he flew home to his grandmother to rest.
He let the master mariner stay master mariner as long as he might
choose, and if he has not died he is still sailing the seas at his own
sweet will, and letting the wind blow according to how he turns his cap."
snail-rose-tree,1,"Round about the garden ran a hedge of hazel-bushes; beyond the hedge were fields and meadows with cows and sheep; but in the middle of the garden stood a Rose-tree in bloom, under which sat a Snail, whose shell contained a great deal--that is, himself.
""Only wait till my time comes,"" he said; ""I shall do more than grow roses, bear nuts, or give milk, like the hazel-bush, the cows and the sheep.""
""I expect a great deal from you,"" said the rose-tree. ""May I ask when it will appear?""
""I take my time,"" said the snail. ""You're always in such a hurry. That does not excite expectation."""
snail-rose-tree,2,"The following year the snail lay in almost the same spot, in the sunshine under the rose-tree, which was again budding and bearing roses as fresh and beautiful as ever. The snail crept half out of his shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in again.
""Everything is just as it was last year! No progress at all; the rose-tree sticks to its roses and gets no farther."""
snail-rose-tree,3,"The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses and buds till the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet; then it bent down its head, and the snail crept into the ground.
A new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the snail made his too.
""You are an old rose-tree now,"" said the snail. ""You must make haste and die. You have given the world all that you had in you; whether it was of much importance is a question that I have not had time to think about. But this much is clear and plain, that you have not done the least for your inner development, or you would have produced something else. Have you anything to say in defence? You will now soon be nothing but a stick. Do you understand what I say?""
""You frighten me,"" said the rose--tree. ""I have never thought of that."""
snail-rose-tree,4,"""No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all. Have you ever given yourself an account why you bloomed, and how your blooming comes about--why just in that way and in no other?""
""No,"" said the rose-tree. ""I bloom in gladness, because I cannot do otherwise. The sun shone and warmed me, and the air refreshed me; I drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain. I breathed and I lived! Out of the earth there arose a power within me, whilst from above I also received strength; I felt an ever-renewed and ever-increasing happiness, and therefore I was obliged to go on blooming. That was my life; I could not do otherwise."""
snail-rose-tree,5,"""You have led a very easy life,"" remarked the snail.
""Certainly. Everything was given me,"" said the rose-tree. ""But still more was given to you. Yours is one of those deep-thinking natures, one of those highly gifted minds that astonishes the world.""
""I have not the slightest intention of doing so,"" said the snail. ""The world is nothing to me. What have I to do with the world? I have enough to do with myself, and enough in myself."""
snail-rose-tree,6,"""But must we not all here on earth give up our best parts to others, and offer as much as lies in our power? It is true, I have only given roses. But you--you who are so richly endowed--what have you given to the world? What will you give it?""
""What have I given? What am I going to give? I spit at it; it's good for nothing, and does not concern me. For my part, you may go on bearing roses; you cannot do anything else. Let the hazel bush bear nuts, and the cows and sheep give milk; they have each their public. I have mine in myself. I retire within myself and there I stop. The world is nothing to me.""
With this the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up the entrance."
snail-rose-tree,7,"""That's very sad,"" said the rose tree. ""I cannot creep into myself, however much I might wish to do so; I have to go on bearing roses. Then they drop their leaves, which are blown away by the wind. But I once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress's hymn-book, and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom of a young beautiful girl, and how another was kissed by the lips of a child in the glad joy of life. That did me good; it was a real blessing. Those are my recollections, my life.""
And the rose tree went on blooming in innocence, while the snail lay idling in his house--the world was nothing to him."
snail-rose-tree,8,"Years passed by.
The snail had turned to earth in the earth, and the rose tree too. Even the souvenir rose in the hymn-book was faded, but in the garden there were other rose trees and other snails. The latter crept into their houses and spat at the world, for it did not concern them.
Shall we read the story all over again? It will be just the same."
Snow-man,1,"""It is so delightfully cold,"" said the Snow Man, ""that it makes my whole body crackle. This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one. How that great red thing up there is staring at me!"" He meant the sun, who was just setting. ""It shall not make me wink. I shall manage to keep the pieces.""
He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes. His mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth. He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips. The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue."
Snow-man,2,"""There it comes again, from the other side,"" said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. ""Ah, I have cured him of staring, though. Now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself. If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,--I should so like to move. If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do. But I don't understand how. I don't even know how to run.""
""Away, away,"" barked the old yard-dog. He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce ""Bow wow"" properly. He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since. ""The sun will make you run some day. I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him. Away, away, they all have to go.""
""I don't understand you, comrade,"" said the Snow Man. ""Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run? I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side."""
Snow-man,3,"""You know nothing at all,"" replied the yard-dog; ""but then, you've only lately been patched up. What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun. It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well. I think the weather is going to change. I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg. I am sure there is going to be a change.""
""I don't understand him,"" said the Snow Man to himself. ""But I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable. The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too.""
""Away, away,"" barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep."
Snow-man,4,"There was really a change in the weather. Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones. But when the sun rose, the sight was splendid. Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral. While on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops. The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like glittering lace-work. From every twig glistened a white radiance. The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees in summer. Its appearance was wondrously beautiful. And where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about. While the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself."
Snow-man,5,"""This is really beautiful,"" said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man. They both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene. ""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.
""And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time,"" replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; ""he is capital.""
The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend. The snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch.
""Who are these two?"" asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog. ""You have been here longer than I have. Do you know them?""
""Of course I know them,"" replied the yard-dog; ""she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. I never bite those two.""
""But what are they?"" asked the Snow Man.
""They are lovers,"" he replied; ""they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. Away, away!""
""Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?"" asked the Snow Man."
Snow-man,6,"""Well, they belong to the same master,"" retorted the yard-dog. ""Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little. I can see that in you. I have age and experience. I know every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain. Away, away!""
""The cold is delightful,"" said the Snow Man; ""but do tell me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so. It jars all through me when you do that."""
Snow-man,7,"""Away, away!"" barked the yard-dog. ""I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once. Then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap. They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room. So I came to live on the lower story. You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once. I was indeed master to the housekeeper. It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs. But I was more comfortable, for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been. I received quite as good food, or even better. I had my own cushion, and there was a stove--it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath it. Ah, I still dream of that stove. Away, away!"""
Snow-man,8,"""Does a stove look beautiful?"" asked the Snow Man, ""is it at all like me?""
""It is just the reverse of you,"" said the dog; ""it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob. It eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth. We should keep on one side, or under it, to be comfortable. You can see it through the window, from where you stand.""
Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it. The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him. It was very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it. But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is. ""And why did you leave her?"" asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. ""How could you give up such a comfortable place?"""
Snow-man,9,"""I was obliged,"" replied the yard-dog. ""They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here. I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing. 'Bone for bone,' I thought. But they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone. Don't you hear how hoarse I am. Away, away! I can't talk any more like other dogs. Away, away, that is the end of it all.""
But the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey. Where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself. ""What a strange crackling I feel within me,"" he said. ""Shall I ever get in there? It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window.""
""You must never go in there,"" said the yard-dog, ""for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away.""
""I might as well go,"" said the Snow Man, ""for I think I am breaking up as it is."""
Snow-man,10,"During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon. No, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth. This is customary with all stoves. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam. ""I can endure it no longer,"" said he; ""how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"""
Snow-man,11,"The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold. In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him. It was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. But he did not enjoy it. How, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was ""stove sick?"""
Snow-man,12,"""That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,"" said the yard-dog; ""I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it. Away, away,"" he barked and then he added, ""the weather is going to change."" And the weather did change. It began to thaw. As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether. Behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round which the boys had built him up. ""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,"" said the yard-dog. ""Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole."" The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body. That was what moved him so. ""But it's all over now. Away, away."" And soon the winter passed. ""Away, away,"" barked the hoarse yard-dog. But the girls in the house sang,"
Snow-man,13,"""Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;     Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree;   The months are bringing the sweet spring-time,     When the lark in the sky sings joyfully.   Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings,   And I'll mock his note in my wanderings.""
 And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man."
snowflake,1,"Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan, and he had a wife whose name was Marie. They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own.

One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them. The children first made a sort of little terrace, and stamped it hard and firm, and then they began to make a snow woman. Ivan and Marie watched them, the while thinking about many things."
snowflake,2,"Suddenly Ivan's face brightened, and, looking at his wife, he said, 'Wife, why shouldn't we make a snow woman too?'

'Why not?' replied Marie, who happened to be in a very good temper; 'it might amuse us a little. But there is no use making a woman. Let us make a little snow child, and pretend it is a living one.'

'Yes, let us do that,' said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife.

Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow. They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet. On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be.

'What in the world are you doing?' asked a passer-by.

'Can't you guess?' returned Ivan.

'Making a snow-child,' replied Marie."
snowflake,3,"They had finished the nose and the chin. Two holes were left for the eyes, and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth. No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek. He started back in surprise and looked-and behold! the eyes of the child met his, and its lips, which were as red as raspberries, smiled at him!

'What is it?' cried Ivan, crossing himself. 'Am I mad, or is the thing bewitched?'

The snow-child bent its head as if it had been really alive. It moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs.

'Ah! Ivan, Ivan,' exclaimed Marie, trembling with joy, 'heaven has sent us a child at last!' And she threw herself upon Snowflake (for that was the snow-child's name) and covered her with kisses. And the loose snow fell away from Snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg, and it was a little girl whom Marie held in her arms.

'Oh! my darling Snowflake!' cried the old woman, and led her into the cottage."
snowflake,4,"And Snowflake grew fast; each hour as well as each day made a difference, and every day she became more and more beautiful. The old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy, and thought of nothing else. The cottage was always full of village children, for they amused Snowflake, and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her. She was their doll, and they were continually inventing new dresses for her, and teaching her songs or playing with her. Nobody knew how clever she was! She noticed everything, and could learn a lesson in a moment. Anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least! And, besides all that, she was so good and obedient; and so pretty, too! Her skin was as white as snow, her eyes as blue as forget-me-nots, and her hair was long and golden. Only her cheeks had no colour in them, but were as fair as her forehead."
snowflake,5,"So the winter went on, till at last the spring sun mounted higher in the heavens and began to warm the earth. The grass grew green in the fields, and high in the air the larks were heard singing. The village girls met and danced in a ring, singing, 'Beautiful spring, how came you here? How came you here? Did you come on a plough, or was it a harrow?' Only Snowflake sat quite still by the window of the cottage.

'What is the matter, dear child?' asked Marie. 'Why are you so sad? Are you ill? or have they treated you unkindly?'

'No,' replied Snowflake, 'it is nothing, mother; no one has hurt me; I am well.'"
snowflake,6,"The spring sun had chased away the last snow from its hiding place under the hedges; the fields were full of flowers; nightingales sang in the trees, and all the world was gay. But the gayer grew the birds and the flowers the sadder became Snowflake. She hid herself from her playmates, and curled herself up where the shadows were deepest, like a lily amongst its leaves. Her only pleasure was to lie amid the green willows near some sparkling stream. At the dawn and at twilight only she seemed happy. When a great storm broke, and the earth was white with hail, she became bright and joyous as the Snowflake of old; but when the clouds passed, and the hail melted beneath the sun, Snowflake would burst into tears and weep as a sister would weep over her brother."
snowflake,7,"The spring passed, and it was the eve of St. John, or Midsummer Day. This was the greatest holiday of the year, when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play. They went to fetch Snowflake, and said to Marie: 'Let her come and dance with us.'

But Marie was afraid; she could not tell why, only she could not bear the child to go. Snowflake did not wish to go either, but they had no excuse ready. So Marie kissed the girl and said: 'Go, my Snowflake, and be happy with your friends, and you, dear children, be careful of her. You know she is the light of my eyes to me.'"
snowflake,8,"'Oh, we will take care of her,' cried the girls gaily, and they ran off to the woods. There they wore wreaths, gathered nosegays, and sang songs some sad, some merry. And whatever they did Snowflake did too.

When the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass, and placed themselves in a row, Snowflake being the last of all. 'Now, watch us,' they said, 'and run just as we do.'

And they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire."
snowflake,9,"Suddenly, close behind them, they heard a sigh, then a groan. 'Ah!' They turned hastily and looked at each other. There was nothing. They looked again. Where was Snowflake? She has hidden herself for fun, they thought, and searched for her everywhere. 'Snowflake! Snowflake!' But there was no answer. 'Where can she be? Oh, she must have gone home.' They returned to the village, but there was no Snowflake.

For days after that they sought her high and low. They examined every bush and every hedge, but there was no Snowflake. And long after everyone else had given up hope Ivan and Marie would wander through the woods crying 'Snowflake, my dove, come back, come back!' And sometimes they thought they heard a call, but it was never the voice of Snowflake.

And what had become of her? Had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into his lair in the forest? Had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea?

No, no beast had touched her, no bird had borne her away. With the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends Snowflake had melted away, and a little soft haze floating upwards was all that remained of her."
spectre-fjelkinge,1,"During the first half of the eighteenth century, several large estates
in Schonen were the property of the family of Barnekow. Or rather, they were property of
its most distinguished representative at that time, Margaret Barnekow. She was the daughter of the famous captain and governor-general Count Rutger of Aschenberg, and the wife of Colonel Kjell Kristofer Barnekow. A widow at twenty-nine, she herself took over the management of her large
properties. She showed evidence of invincible courage, an
endless capacity for work, and a tireless concern for all her
many dependents and servitors."
spectre-fjelkinge,2,"While traveling about her estates, Madame Margaret one evening came to the tavern in Fjelkinge. She was quartered for the night in a room
that had the name of being haunted. Some years before a traveler had
lain in the same room and presumably had been murdered. At any rate,
the man himself and all his belongings had disappeared without leaving
a trace. The mystery had never been explained. Since that time the
room had been haunted. Those who knew about it preferred to
travel a post-station further in the dark, rather than pass the night
in the room in question. But Margaret Barnekow did not do so. She had
already shown greater courage in greater contingencies, and chose this
particular room to sleep in without any fear."
spectre-fjelkinge,3,"She let the lamp burn and fell asleep, after she had said her evening
prayer. On the stroke of twelve she awoke, just as some planks were
raised in the floor. Up rose a bleeding phantom whose head, split
wide open, hung down on his shoulder."
spectre-fjelkinge,4,"""Noble lady,"" whispered the specter, ""prepare a grave in consecrated
earth for a murdered man. Deliver his murderer to the judgment
which is his due!"""
spectre-fjelkinge,5,"God-fearing and unafraid, Madame Margaret beckoned the phantom nearer. He told her he had already addressed the same prayer to various other people. But none had had the courage to grant it. Then
Madame Margaret drew a gold ring from her finger, laid it on the
gaping wound, and tied up the head of the murdered man with her
kerchief. With a glance of unspeakable gratitude he told her the
murderer's name, and disappeared beneath the floor without a sound."
spectre-fjelkinge,6,"The following morning Madame Margaret sent for the sheriff of the
district to come to the tavern with some of his people. She informed him
of what had happened to her during the night, and ordered those
present to tear up the floor. And there they found, buried in the
earth, the remains of a body and, in a wound in its head, the
Countess's ring. Tied about its head was her kerchief. One of the
bystanders grew pale at the sight, and fell senseless to the ground.
When he came to his senses, he confessed that he had murdered the
traveler and robbed him of his belongings. He was condemned to death
for his crime, and the body of the murdered man was buried in the
village church-yard."
spectre-fjelkinge,7,"The ring, of peculiar shape, and its setting bearing a large gray
stone, is still preserved in the Barnekow family. Magic virtues in
cases of sickness, fire and other misfortunes are ascribed to it. And
when one of the Barnekows dies, it is said that a red spot, like a
drop of blood, appears on the stone."
starkad-bale,1,"Starkad, the hero of the legends, the bravest warrior in the army of
the North, had fallen into disgrace with the king because of a certain
princess, so he wandered up into Norland, and settled down at Rude in
Tuna, where he was known as the Thrall of the Alders or the Red
Fellow."
starkad-bale,2,"In Balbo, nine miles from Rude, dwelt another hero, Bale, a good
friend and companion-at-arms of Starkad.

One morning Starkad climbed the Klefberg in Tuna, and called over to
Bale: ""Bale in Balbo, are you awake?"""
starkad-bale,3,"""Red Fellow!"" answered Bale, nine miles away, ""the sun and I wake
together! But how goes it with you?""

""None too well. I eat salmon morning, noon and night. Come over with a
bit of meat!"""
starkad-bale,4,"""I'll come!"" Bale called back, and in a few hours time he was down in
Tuna with an elk under each arm.

The following morning Bale in Balbo stood on a hill in Borgsjo and
called: ""Red Fellow! Are you awake?"""
starkad-bale,5,"""The sun and I wake together!"" answered Starkad. ""And how goes it with
you?""

""Alas, I have nothing to eat but meat! Elk in the morning, elk at noon
and elk at night. Come over and bring a fish-tail along with you!"""
starkad-bale,6,"""I'm coming!"" called out Starkad, and in a short time he had joined
his friend with a barrel of salmon under each arm."
starkad-bale,7,"In this fashion the two friends provided themselves with all the game
to be found in the woods and in the water, and spread terror and
destruction throughout the countryside. But one evening, when they
were just returning to the sea from an excursion, a black cloud came
up, and a tempest broke. They hurried along as fast as they could; but
got no further than Vattjom, where a flash of lightning struck Starkad
and flung him to the ground. His friend and companion-at-arms buried
him beneath a stone cairn, about which he set five rocks: two at his
feet, two at his shoulders, and one at his head; and that grave,
measuring twenty ells in length, may still be seen near the river."
stompe-pilt,1,"Not far from Baalsberg, near Filkestad in the Willandsharad, there is a hill in which a giant named Stompe Pilt once used to live.

It happened one day that a goat-herd was driving his flock up the hill in which Stompe Pilt dwelt."
stompe-pilt,2,"""Who is there?"" cried the giant. He rushed out of his hill with a hunk of flint-rock in his fist.

""I am, if that's what you want to know!"" shouted the shepherd-lad and continued driving his goats up the hill.

""If you come here, I will squash you as I squash this stone!"" cried the giant. He crushed it into fine sand between his fingers.

""And I will squash you till the water runs out, just as I squash this stone!"" answered the shepherd-lad, drawing a fresh cheese from his pocket, and pressing it hard, so that the water ran from his fingers."
stompe-pilt,3,"""Are you not frightened?"" asked the giant.

""Of you? Certainly not!"" was the youth's reply.

""Then we will fight with one another!"" proposed the giant.

""As you choose,"" replied the shepherd, ""but first we must abuse each other so that we can get into a proper rage. As we abuse each other we will grow angry, and when we are angry we will fight!""

""But I shall begin by abusing you,"" said the giant."
stompe-pilt,4,"""As you choose,"" said the youth, ""but then it will be my turn.""

""May a troll with a crooked nose take you!"" yelled the giant.

""May a flying devil carry you off!"" answered the shepherd and he shot a sharp arrow against the giant's body with his bow.

""What was that?"" asked the giant, and tried to pull the arrow out of his body.

""That was a word of abuse,"" said the shepherd."
stompe-pilt,5,"""How does it come to have feathers?"" asked the giant.

""The better to fly with,"" answered the shepherd.

""Why does it stick so tight?"" the giant continued.

""Because it has taken root in your body,"" was the shepherd's answer.

""Have you any other abusive words of the same sort?"" asked the giant. ""Here is another one,"" replied the youth. He shot another arrow into the giant.

""Ouch, ouch!"" cried Stompe Pilt, ""are you still not angry enough for us to come to blows?"""
stompe-pilt,6,"""No, I have not abused you enough as yet,"" said the shepherd and aimed another arrow.

""Lead your goats wherever you choose! If I cannot stand your abusive words, I surely will not be able to bear up against your blows,"" cried Stompe Pilt. He jumped back into his hill.

And that is how the shepherd gained the victory. He was brave and did not let the stupid giant frighten him."
storks,1,"ON the last house in the village there lay a stork's nest. The mother stork sat in it with her four little ones, who were stretching out their heads with their pointed black bills that had not yet turned red. At a little distance, on the top of the roof, stood the father stork, bolt upright and as stiff as could be. That he might not appear quite idle while standing sentry, he had drawn one leg up under him, as is the manner of storks. One might have taken him to be carved in marble, so still did he stand."
storks,2,"""It must look very grand for my wife to have a sentinel to guard her nest,"" he thought. ""They can't know that I am her husband and will, of course, conclude that I am commanded to stand here by her nest. It looks aristocratic!""
Below, in the street, a crowd of children were playing. When they chanced to catch sight of the storks, one of the boldest of the boys began to sing the old song about the stork. The others soon joined him, but each sang the words that he happened to have heard. This is one of the ways:
          ""Stork, stork, fly away;            Stand not on one leg to-day.            Thy dear wife sits in the nest,            To lull the little ones to rest.
          ""There's a halter for one,            There's a stake for another,            For the third there's a gun,            And a spit for his brother!"""
storks,3,"""Only listen,"" said the young storks, ""to what the boys are singing. Do you hear them say we're to be hanged and shot?""
""Don't listen to what they say; if you don't mind, it won't hurt you,"" said the mother.
But the boys went on singing, and pointed mockingly at the sentinel stork. Only one boy, whom they called Peter, said it was a shame to make game of animals, and he would not join in the singing at all.
The mother stork tried to comfort her young ones. ""Don't mind them,"" she said; ""see how quiet your father stands on one leg there.""
""But we are afraid,"" said the little ones, drawing back their beaks into the nest."
storks,4,"The children assembled again on the next day, and no sooner did they see the storks than they again began their song:
          ""The first will be hanged,            The second be hit.""
""Tell us, are we to be hanged and burned?"" asked the young storks.
""No, no; certainly not,"" replied the mother. ""You are to learn to fly, and then we shall pay a visit to the frogs. They will bow to us in the water and sing 'Croak! croak!' and we shall eat them up, and that will be a great treat.""
""And then what?"" questioned the young storks.
""Oh, then all the storks in the land will assemble, and the autumn sports will begin; only then one must be able to fly well, for that is very important. Whoever does not fly as he should will be pierced to death by the general's beak, so mind that you learn well, when the drill begins.""
""Yes, but then, after that, we shall be killed, as the boys say. Hark! they are singing it again."""
storks,5,"""Attend to me and not to them,"" said the mother stork. ""After the great review we shall fly away to warm countries, far from here, over hills and forests. To Egypt we shall fly, where are the three-cornered houses of stone, one point of which reaches to the clouds; they are called pyramids and are older than a stork can imagine. In that same land there is a river which overflows its banks and turns the whole country into mire. We shall go into the mire and eat frogs.""
""Oh! oh!"" exclaimed all the youngsters.
""Yes, it is indeed a delightful place. We need do nothing all day long but eat; and while we are feasting there so comfortably, in this country there is not a green leaf left on the trees. It is so cold here that the very clouds freeze in lumps or fall down in little white rags."" It was hail and snow that she meant, but she did not know how to say it better."
storks,6,"""And will the naughty boys freeze in lumps?"" asked the young storks.
""No, they will not freeze in lumps, but they will come near it, and they will sit moping and cowering in gloomy rooms while you are flying about in foreign lands, amid bright flowers and warm sunshine.""
Some time passed, and the nestlings had grown so large and strong that they could stand upright in the nest and look all about them. Every day the father stork came with delicious frogs, nice little snakes, and other such dainties that storks delight in. How funny it was to see the clever feats he performed to amuse them! He would lay his head right round upon his tail; and sometimes he would clatter with his beak, as if it were a little rattle; or he would tell them stories, all relating to swamps and fens."
storks,7,"""Come, children,"" said the mother stork one day, ""now you must learn to fly."" And all the four young storks had to go out on the ridge of the roof. How they did totter and stagger about! They tried to balance themselves with their wings, but came very near falling to the ground.
""Look at me!"" said the mother. ""This is the way to hold your head. And thus you must place your feet. Left! right! left! right! that's what will help you on in the world.""
Then she flew a little way, and the young ones took a clumsy little leap. Bump! plump! down they fell, for their bodies were still too heavy for them.
""I will not fly,"" said one of the young storks, as he crept back to the nest. ""I don't care about going to warm countries.""
""Do you want to stay here and freeze when the winter comes? Will you wait till the boys come to hang, to burn, or to roast you? Well, then, I'll call them.""
""Oh, no!"" cried the timid stork, hopping back to the roof with the rest."
storks,8,"By the third day they actually began to fly a little. Then they had no doubt that they could soar or hover in the air, upborne by their wings. And this they attempted to do, but down they fell, flapping their wings as fast as they could.
Again the boys came to the street, singing their song, ""Storks, storks, fly home and rest.""
""Shall we fly down and peck them?"" asked the young ones.
""No, leave them alone. Attend to me; that's far more important. One--two--three! now we fly round to the right. One--two--three! now to the left, round the chimney. There! that was very good. That last flap with your wings and the kick with your feet were so graceful and proper that to-morrow you shall fly with me to the marsh. Several of the nicest stork families will be there with their children. Let me see that mine are the best bred of all. Carry your heads high and mind you strut about proudly, for that looks well and helps to make one respected."""
storks,9,"""But shall we not take revenge upon the naughty boys?"" asked the young storks.
""No, no; let them scream away, as much as they please. You are to fly up to the clouds and away to the land of the pyramids, while they are freezing and can neither see a green leaf nor taste a sweet apple.""
""But we will revenge ourselves,"" they whispered one to another. And then the training began again."
storks,10,"Among all the children down in the street the one that seemed most bent upon singing the song that made game of the storks was the boy who had begun it, and he was a little fellow hardly more than six years old. The young storks, to be sure, thought he was at least a hundred, for he was much bigger than their parents, and, besides, what did they know about the ages of either children or grown men? Their whole vengeance was to be aimed at this one boy. It was always he who began the song and persisted in mocking them. The young storks were very angry, and as they grew larger they also grew less patient under insult, and their mother was at last obliged to promise them that they might be revenged--but not until the day of their departure."
storks,11,"""We must first see how you carry yourselves at the great review. If you do so badly that the general runs his beak through you, then the boys will be in the right--at least in one way. We must wait and see!""
""Yes, you shall see!"" cried all the young storks; and they took the greatest pains, practicing every day, until they flew so evenly and so lightly that it was a pleasure to see them.
The autumn now set in; all the storks began to assemble, in order to start for the warm countries and leave winter behind them. And such exercises as there were! Young fledglings were set to fly over forests and villages, to see if they were equal to the long journey that was before them. So well did our young storks acquit themselves, that, as a proof of the satisfaction they had given, the mark they got was, ""Remarkably well,"" with a present of a frog and a snake, which they lost no time in eating.
""Now,"" said they, ""we will be revenged."""
storks,12,"""Yes, certainly,"" said their mother; ""and I have thought of a way that will surely be the fairest. I know a pond where all the little human children lie till the stork comes to take them to their parents. There lie the pretty little babies, dreaming more sweetly than they ever dream afterwards. All the parents are wishing for one of these little ones, and the children all want a sister or a brother. Now we'll fly to the pond and bring back a baby for every child who did not sing the naughty song that made game of the storks.""
""But the very naughty boy who was the first to begin the song,"" cried the young storks, ""what shall we do with him?""
""There is a little dead child in the pond--one that has dreamed itself to death. We will bring that for him. Then he will cry because we have brought a little dead brother to him."
storks,13,"""But that good boy,--you have not forgotten him!--the one who said it was a shame to mock at the animals; for him we will bring both a brother and a sister. And because his name is Peter, all of you shall be called Peter, too.""
All was done as the mother had said; the storks were named Peter, and so they are called to this day."
storm-magic,1,"The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew
restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though
he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall
lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did
as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was
ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship.
But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
storm-magic,2,"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices
within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three
coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking
about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning
their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had
assumed another form."
storm-magic,3,"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.

""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first
and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard.""

""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of
them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two
others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,
and sink the ship with every man on board."""
storm-magic,4,"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the
day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?""
once more asked the captain's wife.

""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others.

""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is
used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our
lives!""

""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one
quartermaster.

""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though
some one were smoking in the forward cabin.""

""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the
fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the
quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
storm-magic,5,"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must
be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first
cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,
and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,
and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,
then it is all up with us!""

""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up
with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who
knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out
of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
storm-magic,6,"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything
in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were
useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether
he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide
behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,
he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made
it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full
measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as
though he himself were the captain."
storm-magic,7,"The captain asked what sort of
nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's
being entrusted with the command of a ship. But the boy answered that
was all one to him; if they did not care to buy the three cords of
birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a
single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted
to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he
likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. So
the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they
set sail."
storm-magic,8,"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the
weather was fair and quiet; but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and
with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. The
captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a
captain we have now. Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail
this very minute?"" ""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long.""

Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought
they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would
undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the
ship."
storm-magic,9,"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard,
billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them
touch the other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did
not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling
with death, and then the squall had passed.

""Heaven be praised!"" said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going
to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."""
storm-magic,10,"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there
is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as
what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the
whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last
billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now
there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the
boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on
the whole ship.

The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the
preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she
would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck."
storm-magic,11,"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet
by billet, and no two billets at once. And when the last billet of wood
fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard,
and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood,
as far as eye could reach.

When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of
writing to their wives. ""That is something you might just as well let
be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."""
storm-magic,12,"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the
captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the
quartermasters.

""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying
his deckload of wood.

And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard
anything more of them."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,1,"Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. His surname meant ""Millionaire,"" but although he was not so rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor. He had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on this. He spent his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age.

One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him. The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,2,"""I should like to live,"" he said to himself, ""till I am five or six hundred years old at least, free from all sickness. The ordinary span of a man's life is very short.""

He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished.

He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years. There was a Princess of Yamato, who, it was said, lived to the age of five hundred. This was the latest story of a very long life record."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,3,"Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no-Shiko. He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history. He built all the large palaces, and also the famous great wall of China. He had everything in the world he could wish for. But in spite of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court, the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all.

When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning, as he went through his day, the thought of death was always with him. He could not get away from it. Ah-if only he could find the ""Elixir of Life,"" he would be happy."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,4,"The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the ""Elixir of Life"" of which he had so often read and heard.

One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas there was a country called Horaizan. Certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the ""Elixir of Life."" Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,5,"The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir. He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits.

Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned to the waiting Emperor. But ever since that time Mount Fuji has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir. It has been said that Jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,6,"Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water of perpetual life. He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit all the very high peaks.

So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and started out on his quest. He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the land, climbing to the tops of the highest peaks, but never a hermit did he find."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,7,"At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many days, he met a hunter.

""Can you tell me,"" asked Sentaro, ""where the hermits live who have the Elixir of Life?""

""No."" said the hunter; ""I can't tell you where such hermits live. But, there is a notorious robber living in these parts. It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers."""
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,8,"This odd answer irritated Sentaro very much. He thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way. So he decided to go at once to the shrine of Jofuku, who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of Japan.

Sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days, entreating Jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,9,"At midnight of the seventh day, as Sentaro knelt in the temple, the door of the innermost shrine flew open. Jofuku appeared in a luminous cloud, and calling to Sentaro to come nearer, spoke thus:

""Your desire is a very selfish one and cannot be easily granted. You think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir of Life. Do you know how hard a hermit's life is? A hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees. A hermit must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire. Gradually after following these strict rules, the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold or heat. His body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp, and can walk on water without getting his feet wet."""
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,10,"""You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort. You are not even like an ordinary man, for you are exceptionally idle. You more sensitive to heat and cold than most people. You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time! Do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit's life?""

""In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in another way. I will send you to the country of Perpetual Life, where death never comes-where the people live forever!""

Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane made of paper, telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,11,"Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort. It then spread its wings, rose high in the air, and flew away over the mountains right out to sea.

Sentaro was at first quite frightened. By degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air. On and on they went for thousands of miles. The bird never stopped for rest or food, but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment, and strange to say, neither did Sentaro.

After several days they reached an island. The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,12,"As soon as Sentaro got down from the bird's back, the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket.

Now Sentaro began to look about him wonderingly, curious to see what the country of Perpetual Life was like. He walked first round about the country and then through the town. Everything was, of course, quite strange, and different from his own land. But both the land and the people seemed prosperous, so he decided that it would be good for him to stay there. He took up lodgings at one of the hotels.

The proprietor was a kind man. When Sentaro told him that he was a stranger and had come to live there, he promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the governor of the city concerning Sentaro's sojourn there. He even found a house for his guest, and in this way Sentaro obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country of Perpetual Life."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,13,"Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there, and sickness was a thing unknown. Priests had come over from India and China and told them of a beautiful country called Paradise, where happiness and bliss and contentment fill all men's hearts. But its gates could only be reached by dying. This tradition was handed down for ages from generation to generation-but none knew exactly what death was except that it led to Paradise.

Quite unlike Sentaro and other ordinary people, instead of having a great dread of death, they all, both rich and poor, longed for it as something good and desirable. They were all tired of their long, long lives, and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called Paradise of which the priests had told them centuries ago."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,14,"All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders. He found himself, according to his ideas, in the land of Topsyturvydom. Everything was upside down. He had wished to escape from dying. He had come to the land of Perpetual Life with great relief and joy, only to find that the inhabitants themselves, doomed never to die, would consider it bliss to find death.

What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food. All the things to which he had been accustomed as food they rejected. Whenever any merchants from other countries arrived, the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons. These they swallowed eagerly, hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,15,"But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without effect in this strange place. People who swallowed them with the hope of dying only found that in a short time they felt better in health instead of worse.

Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like. The wealthy would have given all their money and all their goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred years even. Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad.

In the chemist shops there was a drug which was in constant demand. This was because after using it for a hundred years, it was supposed to turn the hair slightly gray and to bring about disorders of the stomach."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,16,"Sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish was served up in restaurants as a delectable dish, and hawkers in the streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish flies. He never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things, nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold.

Sentaro was delighted. He said to himself that he would never grow tired of living, and that he considered it profane to wish for death. He was the only happy man on the island. For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. He set himself up in business, and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,17,"As years went by, however, things did not go as smoothly as at first. He had heavy losses in business, and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors. This caused him great annoyance.

Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him, for he was busy from morning till night. Three hundred years went by in this monotonous way. Then at last he began to grow tired of life in this country, and he longed to see his own land and his old home. However long he lived here, life would always be the same, so was it not foolish and wearisome to stay on here forever?"
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,18,"Sentaro, in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual Life, recollected Jofuku, who had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death. He prayed to the saint to bring him back to his own land again.

No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket. Sentaro was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years. Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it. As he did so, the bird spread its wings and flew, swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan.

Such was the willfulness of the man's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left behind. He tried to stop the bird in vain. The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,19,"Then a storm came on, and the wonderful paper crane got damp, crumpled up, and fell into the sea. Sentaro fell with it. Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned, he cried out loudly to Jofuku to save him. He looked round, but there was no ship in sight. He swallowed a quantity of sea-water, which only increased his miserable plight. While he was thus struggling to keep himself afloat, he saw a monstrous shark swimming towards him. As it came nearer it opened its huge mouth ready to devour him. Sentaro was all but paralyzed with fear now that he felt his end so near. He screamed out as loudly as ever he could to Jofuku to come and rescue him.

Lo, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams, to find that during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine. All his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a wild dream. He was in a cold perspiration with fright, and utterly bewildered."
story-of-man-who-did-not-wish-to-die,20,"Suddenly a bright light came towards him, and in the light stood a messenger. The messenger held a book in his hand, and spoke to Sentaro:

""I am sent to you by Jofuku, who in answer to your prayer, has permitted you in a dream to see the land of Perpetual Life. But you grew weary of living there, and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die.

""In this book I give you there are many precepts good for you to know. If you study them, you will be guided in the way I have pointed out to you.""

The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking, and Sentaro took the lesson to heart. With the book in his hand he returned to his old home. Giving up all his old vain wishes, he tried to live a good and useful life and to observe the lessons taught him in the book, and he and his house prospered henceforth."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,1,"Long, long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating a small plot of land. Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow. This was they had no child. Their only pet was a dog named Shiro. On him they lavished all the affection of their old age. Indeed, they loved him so much that whenever they had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to Shiro. Now Shiro means ""white,"" and he was so called because of his color. He was a real Japanese dog, and very like a small wolf in appearance."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,2,"The happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from his work in the field. Having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables, he would take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage. Sure enough, Shiro was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit. Then the old man said ""Chin, chin!"" and Shiro sat up and begged, and his master gave him the food. Next door to this good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel. They hated their good neighbors and the dog Shiro with all their might. Whenever Shiro happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him, sometimes even wounding him."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,3,"One day Shiro was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master's house. The old man, thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn, hurried out to see what was the matter. As soon as Shiro saw his master he ran to meet him, wagging his tail. Seizing the end of his kimono, he dragged him under a large yenoki tree. Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws, yelping with joy all the time. The old man, unable to understand what it all meant, stood looking on in bewilderment. But Shiro went on barking and digging with all his might."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,4,"The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree, and that the dog had scented it, at last struck the old man. He ran back to the house, fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot. What was his astonishment when, after digging for some time, he came upon a heap of old and valuable coins. The deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find. So intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge. At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground. Shiro sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say, ""You see, though only a dog, I can make some return for all the kindness you show me."""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,5,"The old man ran in to call his wife, and together they carried home the treasure. Thus in one day the poor old man became rich. His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds. He loved and petted him more than ever, if that were possible.

The cross old neighbor, attracted by Shiro's barking, had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure. He began to think that he, too, would like to find a fortune. So a few days later he called at the old man's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow Shiro for a short time."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,6,"Shiro's master thought this a strange request, because he knew quite well that not only did his neighbor not love his pet dog. He never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting him whenever the dog crossed his path. But the good old man was too kind-hearted to refuse his neighbor, so he consented to lend the dog on condition that he should be taken great care of.

The wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face. He told his wife how he had succeeded in his crafty intentions. He then took his spade and hastened to his own field, forcing the unwilling Shiro to follow him. As soon as he reached a yenoki tree, he said to the dog, threateningly:

""If there were gold coins under your master's tree, there must also be gold coins under my tree. You must find them for me! Where are they? Where? Where?"""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,7,"And catching hold of Shiro's neck he held the dog's head to the ground, so that Shiro began to scratch and dig in order to free himself from the horrid old man's grasp.

The old man was very pleased when he saw the dog begin to scratch and dig. He at once supposed that some gold coins lay buried under his tree as well as under his neighbor's, and that the dog had scented them as before. Pushing Shiro away he began to dig himself, but there was nothing to be found. As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable, and he at last came upon a refuse heap."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,8,"The old man's disgust can be imagined. This soon gave way to anger. He had seen his neighbor's good fortune, and hoping for the same luck himself, he had borrowed the dog Shiro. Now, just as he seemed on the point of finding what he sought, only a horrid smelling refuse heap had rewarded him for a morning's digging. Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment, he blamed the poor dog. He seized his spade, and with all his strength struck Shiro and killed him on the spot. He then threw the dog's body into the hole which he had dug in the hope of finding a treasure of gold coins, and covered it over with the earth. Then he returned to the house, telling no one, not even his wife, what he had done."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,9,"After waiting several days, as the dog Shiro did not return, his master began to grow anxious. Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain. Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog. Without any shame or hesitation, the wicked neighbor answered that he had killed Shiro because of his bad behavior. At this dreadful news Shiro's master wept many sad and bitter tears. Great indeed, was his woful surprise, but he was too good and gentle to reproach his bad neighbor. Learning that Shiro was buried under the yenoki tree in the field, he asked the old man to give him the tree, in remembrance of his poor dog Shiro."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,10,"Even the cross old neighbor could not refuse such a simple request, so he consented to give the old man the tree under which Shiro lay buried. Shiro's master then cut the tree down and carried it home. Out of the trunk he made a mortar. In this his wife put some rice, and he began to pound it with the intention of making a festival to the memory of his dog Shiro.

A strange thing happened! His wife put the rice into the mortar, and no sooner had he begun to pound it to make the cakes, than it began to increase in quantity gradually till it was about five times the original amount. The cakes were turned out of the mortar as if an invisible hand were at work."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,11,"When the old man and his wife saw this, they understood that it was a reward to them from Shiro for their faithful love to him. They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food. So from this time they never troubled about food. They lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them.

The greedy neighbor, hearing of this new piece of good luck, was filled with envy as before. He called on the old man and asked leave to borrow the wonderful mortar for a short time, pretending that he, too, sorrowed for the death of Shiro, and wished to make cakes for a festival to the dog's memory."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,12,"The old man did not in the least wish to lend it to his cruel neighbor, but he was too kind to refuse. So the envious man carried home the mortar, but he never brought it back.

Several days passed, and Shiro's master waited in vain for the mortar, so he went to call on the borrower. He asked him to be good enough to return the mortar if he had finished with it. He found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood. On the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar. In answer to the old man's inquiry, the wicked neighbor answered haughtily:

""Have you come to ask me for your mortar? I broke it to pieces, and now I am making a fire of the wood. When I tried to pound cakes in it only some horrid smelling stuff came out."""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,13,"The good old man said:

""I am very sorry for that. It is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them. I would have given you as many as ever you wanted. Now please give me the ashes of the mortar, as I wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog.""

The neighbor consented at once, and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes.

Not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden. A wonderful thing happened!"
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,14,"It was late in autumn and all the trees had shed their leaves, but no sooner did the ashes touch their branches than the cherry trees, the plum trees, and all other blossoming shrubs burst into bloom. The old man's garden was suddenly transformed into a beautiful picture of spring. The old man's delight knew no bounds, and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes.

The story of the old man's garden spread far and wide, and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,15,"One day, soon after this, the old man heard some one knocking at his door. Going to the porch to see who it was he was surprised to see a Knight standing there. This Knight told him that he was a retainer of a great Daimio (Earl). One of the favorite cherry trees in this nobleman's garden had withered. Though every one in his service had tried all manner of means to revive it, none took effect. The Knight was sore perplexed when he saw what great displeasure the loss of his favorite cherry tree caused the Daimio. At this point, fortunately, they had heard that there was a wonderful old man who could make withered trees to blossom. His Lord had sent him to ask the old man to come to him.

""And,"" added the Knight, ""I shall be very much obliged if you will come at once."""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,16,"The good old man was greatly surprised at what he heard, but respectfully followed the Knight to the nobleman's Palace.

The Daimio, who had been impatiently awaiting the old man's coming, as soon as he saw him asked him at once:

""Are you the old man who can make withered trees flower even out of season?""

The old man made an obeisance, and replied:

""I am that old man!""

Then the Daimio said:

""You must make that dead cherry tree in my garden blossom again by means of your famous ashes. I shall look on.""

Then they all went into the garden-the Daimio and his retainers and the ladies-in waiting, who carried the Daimio's sword."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,17,"The old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree. Saying ""Excuse me,"" he took the pot of ashes which he had brought with him, and began to climb the tree. Every one watched his movements with great interest.

At last he climbed to the spot where the tree divided into two great branches. Taking up his position here, the old man sat down and scattered the ashes right and left all over the branches and twigs."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,18,"Wonderful, indeed, was the result! The withered tree at once burst into full bloom! The Daimio was so transported with joy that he looked as if he would go mad. He rose to his feet and spread out his fan, calling the old man down from the tree. He himself gave the old man a wine cup filled with the best SAKE, and rewarded him with much silver and gold and many other precious things. The Daimio ordered that henceforth the old man should call himself by the name of Hana-Saka-Jijii, or ""The Old Man who makes the Trees to Blossom."" Henceforth all were to recognize him by this name. He sent him home with great honor."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,19,"The wicked neighbor, as before, heard of the good old man's fortune, and of all that had so auspiciously befallen him. He could not suppress all the envy and jealousy that filled his heart. He called to mind how he had failed in his attempt to find the gold coins, and then in making the magic cakes. This time surely he must succeed if he imitated the old man, who made withered trees to flower simply by sprinkling ashes on them. This would be the simplest task of all."
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,20,"So he set to work and gathered together all the ashes which remained in the fire-place from the burning of the wonderful mortar. Then he set out in the hope of finding some great man to employ him, calling out loudly as he went along:

""Here comes the wonderful man who can make withered trees blossom! Here comes the old man who can make dead trees blossom!"""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,21,"The Daimio in his Palace heard this cry, and said:

""That must be the Hana-Saka-Jijii passing. I have nothing to do to-day. Let him try his art again. It will amuse me to look on.""

So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord. The satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined.

But the Daimio looking at him, thought it strange that he was not at all like the old man he had seen before, so he asked him:

""Are you the man whom I named Hana-Saka-Jijii?""

And the envious neighbor answered with a lie:

""Yes, my Lord!""

""That is strange!"" said the Daimio. ""I thought there was only one Hana-Saka-Jijii in the world! Has he now some disciples?""

""I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii. The one who came to you before was only my disciple!"" replied the old man again.

""Then you must be more skillful than the other. Try what you can do and let me see!"""
story-of-old-man-who-made-withered-trees-to-flower,22,"The envious neighbor, with the Daimio and his Court following, then went into the garden. Approaching a dead tree, he took out a handful of the ashes which he carried with him, and scattered them over the tree.

But not only did the tree not burst into flower, but not even a bud came forth. Thinking that he had not used enough ashes, the old man took handfuls and again sprinkled them over the withered tree. But all to no effect. After trying several times, the ashes were blown into the Daimio's eyes. This made him very angry. He ordered his retainers to arrest the false Hana-Saka-Jijii at once and put him in prison for an impostor. From this imprisonment the wicked old man was never freed. Thus did he meet with punishment at last for all his evil doings.

The good old man, however, with the treasure of gold coins which Shiro had found for him, and with all the gold and the silver which the Daimio had showered on him, became a rich and prosperous man in his old age, and lived a long and happy life, beloved and respected by all."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,1,"The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered sacred, and guarded with jealous care from time immemorial. These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata, the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami, and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi or the Sword of Murakumo.

Of these three treasures of the Empire, the sword of Murakumo, afterwards known as Kusanagi-no-Tsrugugi, or the grass-cleaving sword, is considered the most precious and most highly to be honored, for it is the symbol of strength to this nation of warriors and the talisman of invincibility for the Emperor, while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ances"
story-of-prince-yamato-take,2,"Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite, the temples dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu, the great and beautiful Sun Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors are said to be descended.

There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name of the sword was changed from that of Murakumo to Kasanagi, which means grass clearing."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,3,"Once, many, many years ago, there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko, the twelfth in descent from the great Jimmu, the founder of the Japanese dynasty. This Prince was the second son of the Emperor Keiko, and he was named Yamato. From his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength, wisdom and courage, and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great things, and he loved him even more than he did his elder son.

Now when Prince Yamato had grown to manhood (in the olden days of Japanese history, a boy was considered to have reached man's estate at the early age of sixteen) the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers, Kumaso and Takeru. These rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the King, in breaking the laws and defying all authority."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,4,"At last King Keiko ordered his younger son Prince Yamato to subdue the brigands and, if possible, to rid the land of their evil lives. Prince Yamato was only sixteen years of age, he had but reached his manhood according to the law, yet though he was such a youth in years he possessed the dauntless spirit of a warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was. Even then there was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds, and he received his father's command with great joy."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,5,"He at once made ready to start, and great was the stir in the precincts of the Palace as he and his trusty followers gathered together and prepared for the expedition, and polished up their armor and donned it. Before he left his father's Court he went to pray at the shrine of Ise and to take leave of his aunt the Princess Yamato, for his heart was somewhat heavy at the thought of the dangers he had to face, and he felt that he needed the protection of his ancestress, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. The Princess his aunt came out to give him glad welcome, and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a mission by his father the King. She then gave him one of her gorgeous robes as a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good luck, saying that it would surely be of service to him on this adventure. She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,6,"The young Prince bowed low before his aunt, and received her gracious gift with much pleasure and many respectful bows.

""I will now set out,"" said the Prince, and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops. Thus cheered by his aunt's blessing, he felt ready for all that might befall, and marching through the land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu, the home of the brigands."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,7,"Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island, and then slowly but surely made his way to the head-quarters of the chiefs Kumaso and Takeru. He now met with great difficulties, for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough. The mountains were high and steep, the valleys dark and deep, and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his army. It was all but impossible to go on.

Though the Prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years, and, seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further, he said to himself:

""To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder. We cannot clear the roads and fight as well. It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares. In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion."""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,8,"So he now bade his army halt by the way. His wife, the Princess Ototachibana, had accompanied him, and he bade her bring him the robe his aunt the priestess of Ise had given him, and to help him attire himself as a woman. With her help he put on the robe, and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders. Ototachibana then brought him her comb, which he put in his black tresses, and then adorned himself with strings of strange jewels. When he had finished his unusual toilet, Ototachibana brought him her mirror. He smiled as he gazed at himself-the disguise was so perfect."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,9,"He hardly knew himself, so changed was he. All traces of the warrior had disappeared, and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him.

Thus completely disguised, he set out for the enemy's camp alone. In the folds of his silk gown, next his strong heart, was hidden a sharp dagger.

The two chiefs Kumaso and Takeru wore sitting in their tent, resting in the cool of the evening, when the Prince approached. They were talking of the news which had recently been carried to them, that the King's son had entered their country with a large army determined to exterminate their band. They had both heard of the young warrior's renown, and for the first time in their wicked lives they felt afraid. In a pause in their talk they happened to look up, and saw through the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in sumptuous garments coming towards them. Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight. Little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,10,"""What a beautiful woman! Where has she come from?"" said the astonished Kumaso, forgetting war and council and everything as he looked at the gentle intruder.

He beckoned to the disguised Prince and bade him sit down and serve them with wine. Yamato Take felt his heart swell with a fierce glee for he now knew that his plan would succeed. However, he dissembled cleverly, and putting on a sweet air of shyness he approached the rebel chief with slow steps and eyes glancing like a frightened deer. Charmed to distraction by the girl's loveliness Kumaso drank cup after cup of wine for the pleasure of seeing her pour it out for him, till at last he was quite overcome with the quantity he had drunk."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,11,"This was the moment for which the brave Prince had been waiting. Flinging down the wine jar, he seized the tipsy and astonished Kumaso and quickly stabbed him to death with the dagger which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast.

Takeru, the brigand's brother, was terror-struck as soon as he saw what was happening and tried to escape, but Prince Yamato was too quick for him. Ere he could reach the tent door the Prince was at his heel, his garments were clutched by a hand of iron, and a dagger flashed before his eyes and he lay stabbed to the earth, dying but not yet dead."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,12,"""Wait one moment!"" gasped the brigand painfully, and he seized the Prince's hand.

Yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said.

""Why should I pause, thou villain?""

The brigand raised himself fearfully and said:

""Tell me from whence you come, and whom I have the honor of addressing? Hitherto I believed that my dead brother and I were the strongest men in the land, and that there was no one who could overcome us. Alone you have ventured into our stronghold, alone you have attacked and killed us! Surely you are more than mortal?"""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,13,"Then the young Prince answered with a proud smile:-""I am the son of the King and my name is Yamato, and I have been sent by my father as the avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels! No longer shall robbery and murder hold my people in terror!"" and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel's head.

""Ah,"" gasped the dying man with a great effort, ""I have often heard of you. You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us. Allow me to give you a new name. From henceforth you shall be known as Yamato Take. Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in Yamato."""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,14,"And with these noble words, Takeru fell back and died.

The Prince having thus successfully put an end to his father's enemies in the world, was prepared to return to the capital. On the way back he passed through the province of Idum. Here he met with another outlaw named Idzumo Takeru who he knew had done much harm in the land. He again resorted to stratagem, and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name. Having done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword. This he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion when he expected to meet the third robber Takeru.

He now invited Takeru to the bank of the River Hinokawa, and persuaded him to try a swim with him in the cool refreshing waters of the river."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,15,"As it was a hot summer's day, the rebel was nothing loath to take a plunge in the river, while his enemy was still swimming down the stream the Prince turned back and landed with all possible haste. Unperceived, he managed to change swords, putting his wooden one in place of the keen steel sword of Takeru.

Knowing nothing of this, the brigand came up to the bank shortly. As soon as he had landed and donned his clothes, the Prince came forward and asked him to cross swords with him to prove his skill, saying:

""Let us two prove which is the better swordsman of the two!"""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,16,"The robber agreed with delight, feeling certain of victory, for he was famous as a fencer in his province and he did not know who his adversary was. He seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself. Alas! for the rebel the sword was the wooden one of the young Prince and in vain Takeru tried to unsheathe it-it was jammed fast, not all his exerted strength could move it. Even if his efforts had been successful the sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood. Yamato Take saw that his enemy was in his power, and swinging high the sword he had taken from Takeru he brought it down with great might and dexterity and cut off the robber's head."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,17,"In this way, sometimes by using his wisdom and sometimes by using his bodily strength, and at other times by resorting to craftiness, which was as much esteemed in those days as it is despised in these, he prevailed against all the King's foes one by one, and brought peace and rest to the land and the people.

When he returned to the capital the King praised him for his brave deeds, and held a feast in the Palace in honor of his safe coming home and presented him with many rare gifts. From this time forth the King loved him more than ever and would not let Yamato Take go from his side, for he said that his son was now as precious to him as one of his arms."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,18,"But the Prince was not allowed to live an idle life long. When he was about thirty years old, news was brought that the Ainu race, the aborigines of the islands of Japan, who had been conquered and pushed northwards by the Japanese, had rebelled in the Eastern provinces, and leaving the vicinity which had been allotted to them were causing great trouble in the land. The King decided that it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to reason. But who was to lead the men?"
story-of-prince-yamato-take,19,"Prince Yamato Take at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into subjection. Now as the King loved the Prince dearly, and could not bear to have him go out of his sight even for the length of one day, he was of course very loath to send him on his dangerous expedition. But in the whole army there was no warrior so strong or so brave as the Prince his son, so that His Majesty, unable to do otherwise, reluctantly complied with Yamato's wish.

When the time came for the Prince to start, the King gave him a spear called the Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree (the handle was probably made from the wood of the holly tree), and ordered him to set out to subjugate the Eastern Barbarians as the Ainu were then called."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,20,"The Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree of those old days, was prized by warriors just as much as the Standard or Banner is valued by a regiment in these modern days, when given by the King to his soldiers on the occasion of setting out for war.

The Prince respectfully and with great reverence received the King's spear, and leaving the capital, marched with his army to the East. On his way he visited first of all the temples of Ise for worship, and his aunt the Princess of Yamato and High Priestess came out to greet him. She it was who had given him her robe which had proved such a boon to him before in helping him to overcome and slay the brigands of the West."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,21,"He told her all that had happened to him, and of the great part her keepsake had played in the success of his previous undertaking, and thanked her very heartily. When she heard that he was starting out once again to do battle with his father's enemies, she went into the temple, and reappeared bearing a sword and a beautiful bag which she had made herself, and which was full of flints, which in those times people used instead of matches for making fire. These she presented to him as a parting gift.

The sword was the sword of Murakumo, one of the three sacred treasures which comprise the insignia of the Imperial House of Japan. No more auspicious talisman of luck and success could she have given her nephew, and she bade him use it in the hour of his greatest need."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,22,"Yamato Take now bade farewell to his aunt, and once more placing himself at the head of his men he marched to the farthest East through the province of Owari, and then he reached the province of Suruga. Here the governor welcomed the Prince right heartily and entertained him royally with many feasts. When these were over, the governor told his guest that his country was famous for its fine deer, and proposed a deer hunt for the Prince's amusement. The Prince was utterly deceived by the cordiality of his host, which was all feigned, and gladly consented to join in the hunt."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,23,"The governor then led the Prince to a wild and extensive plain where the grass grew high and in great abundance. Quite ignorant that the governor had laid a trap for him with the desire to compass his death, the Prince began to ride hard and hunt down the deer, when all of a sudden to his amazement he saw flames and smoke bursting out from the bush in front of him. Realizing his danger he tried to retreat, but no sooner did he turn his horse in the opposite direction than he saw that even there the prairie was on fire. At the same time the grass on his left and right burst into flames, and these began to spread swiftly towards him on all sides. He looked round for a chance of escape. There was none. He was surrounded by fire."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,24,"""This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy!"" said the Prince, looking round on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled in towards him on every side. ""What a fool I was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast!"" and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought of the governor's smiling treachery.

Dangerous as was his situation now, the Prince was not in the least confounded. In his dire extremity he remembered the gifts his aunt had given him when they parted, and it seemed to him as if she must, with prophetic foresight, have divined this hour of need. He coolly opened the flint-bag that his aunt had given him and set fire to the grass near him. Then drawing the sword of Murakumo from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of him with all speed. He determined to die, if that were necessary, fighting for his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,25,"Strange to say the wind began to change and to blow from the opposite direction, and the fiercest portion of the burning bush which had hitherto threatened to come upon him was now blown right away from him, and the Prince, without even a scratch on his body or a single hair burned, lived to tell the tale of his wonderful escape, while the wind rising to a gale overtook the governor, and he was burned to death in the flames he had set alight to kill Yamato Take."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,26,"Now the Prince ascribed his escape entirely to the virtue of the sword of Murakumo, and to the protection of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess of Ise, who controls the wind and all the elements and insures the safety of all who pray to her in the hour of danger. Lifting the precious sword he raised it above his head many times in token of his great respect, and as he did this he re-named it Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or the Grass-Cleaving Sword, and the place where he set fire to the grass round him and escaped from death in the burning prairie, he called Yaidzu. To this day there is a spot along the great Tokaido railway named Yaidzu, which is said to be the very place where this thrilling event took place."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,27,"Thus did the brave Prince Yamato Take escape out of the snare laid for him by his enemy. He was full of resource and courage, and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes. Leaving Yaidzu he marched eastward, and came to the shore at Idzu from whence he wished to cross to Kadzusa.

In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the Princess Ototachibana. For his sake she counted the weariness of the long journeys and the dangers of war as nothing, and her love for her warrior husband was so great that she felt well repaid for all her wanderings if she could but hand him his sword when he sallied forth to battle, or minister to his wants when he returned weary to the camp."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,28,"But the heart of the Prince was full of war and conquest and he cared little for the faithful Ototachibana. From long exposure in traveling, and from care and grief at her lord's coldness to her, her beauty had faded, and her ivory skin was burnt brown by the sun, and the Prince told her one day that her place was in the Palace behind the screens at home and not with him upon the warpath. But in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband's part, Ototachibana could not find it in her heart to leave him. But perhaps it would have been better for her if she had done so, for on the way to Idzu, when they came to Owari, her heart was well-nigh broken."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,29,"Here dwelt in a Palace shaded by pine-trees and approached by imposing gates, the Princess Miyadzu, beautiful as the cherry blossom in the blushing dawn of a spring morning. Her garments were dainty and bright, and her skin was white as snow, for she had never known what it was to be weary along the path of duty or to walk in the heat of a summer's sun. And the Prince was ashamed of his sunburnt wife in her travel-stained garments, and bade her remain behind while he went to visit the Princess Miyadzu. Day after day he spent hours in the gardens and the Palace of his new friend, thinking only of his pleasure, and caring little for his poor wife who remained behind to weep in the tent at the misery which had come into her life. Yet she was so faithful a wife, and her character so patient, that she never allowed a reproach to escape her lips, or a frown to mar the sweet sadness of her face, and she was ever ready with a smile to welcome her husband back or usher him forth wherever he went."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,30,"At last the day came when the Prince Yamato Take must depart for Idzu and cross over the sea to Kadzusa, and he bade his wife follow in his retinue as an attendant while he went to take a ceremonious farewell of the Princess Miyadzu. She came out to greet him dressed in gorgeous robes, and she seemed more beautiful than ever, and when Yamato Take saw her he forgot his wife, his duty, and everything except the joy of the idle present, and swore that he would return to Owari and marry her when the war was over. And as he looked up when he had said these words he met the large almond eyes of Ototachibana fixed full upon him in unspeakable sadness and wonder, and he knew that he had done wrong, but he hardened his heart and rode on, caring little for the pain he had caused her."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,31,"When they reached the seashore at Idzu his men sought for boats in which to cross the straits to Kadzusa, but it was difficult to find boats enough to allow all the soldiers to embark. Then the Prince stood on the beach, and in the pride of his strength he scoffed and said:

""This is not the sea! This is only a brook! Why do you men want so many boats? I could jump this if I would.""

When at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the straits, the sky suddenly clouded and a great storm arose. The waves rose mountains high, the wind howled, the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled, and the boat which held Ototachibana and the Prince and his men was tossed from crest to crest of the rolling waves, till it seemed that every moment must be their last and that they must all be swallowed up in the angry sea. For Kin Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, had heard Yamato Take jeer, and had raised this terrible storm in anger, to show the scoffing Prince how awful the sea could be though it did but look like a brook."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,32,"The terrified crew lowered the sails and looked after the rudder, and worked for their dear lives' sake, but all in vain-the storm only seemed to increase in violence, and all gave themselves up for lost. Then the faithful Ototachibana rose, and forgetting all the grief that her husband had caused her, forgetting even that he had wearied of her, in the one great desire of her love to save him, she determined to sacrifice her life to rescue him from death if it were possible.

While the waves dashed over the ship and the wind whirled round them in fury she stood up and said:

""Surely all this has come because the Prince has angered Rin Jin, the God of the Sea, by his jesting. If so, I, Ototachibana, will appease the wrath of the Sea God who desires nothing less than my husband's life!"""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,33,"Then addressing the sea she said:

""I will take the place of His Augustness, Yamato Take. I will now cast myself into your outraged depths, giving my life for his. Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa.""

With these words she leaped quickly into the boisterous sea, and the waves soon whirled her away and she was lost to sight. Strange to say, the storm ceased at once, and the sea became as calm and smooth as the matting on which the astonished onlookers were sitting. The gods of the sea were now appeased, and the weather cleared and the sun shone as on a summer's day."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,34,"Yamato Take soon reached the opposite shore and landed safely, even as his wife Ototachibana had prayed. His prowess in war was marvelous, and he succeeded after some time in conquering the Eastern Barbarians, the Ainu.

He ascribed his safe landing wholly to the faithfulness of his wife, who had so willingly and lovingly sacrificed herself in the hour of his utmost peril. His heart was softened at the remembrance of her, and he never allowed her to pass from his thoughts even for a moment. Too late had he learned to esteem the goodness of her heart and the greatness of her love for him."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,35,"As he was returning on his homeward way he came to the high pass of the Usui Toge, and here he stood and gazed at the wonderful prospect beneath him. The country, from this great elevation, all lay open to his sight, a vast panorama of mountain and plain and forest, with rivers winding like silver ribbons through the land; then far off he saw the distant sea, which shimmered like a luminous mist in the great distance, where Ototachibana had given her life for him, and as he turned towards it he stretched out his arms, and thinking of her love which he had scorned and his faithlessness to her, his heart burst out into a sorrowful and bitter cry:

""Azuma, Azuma, Ya!"" (Oh! my wife, my wife!) And to this day there is a district in Tokio called Azuma, which commemorates the words of Prince Yamato Take, and the place where his faithful wife leapt into the sea to save him is still pointed out. So, though in life the Princess Ototachibana was unhappy, history keeps her memory green, and the story of her unselfishness and heroic death will never pass away."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,36,"Yamato Take had now fulfilled all his father's orders, he had subdued all rebels, and rid the land of all robbers and enemies to the peace, and his renown was great, for in the whole land there was no one who could stand up against him, he was so strong in battle and wise in council.

He was about to return straight for home by the way he had come, when the thought struck him that he would find it more interesting to take another route, so he passed through the province of Owari and came to the province of Omi."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,37,"When the Prince reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear. In many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations. On inquiring the cause of this he was told that a terrible monster had appeared in the mountains, who daily came down from thence and made raids on the villages, devouring whoever he could seize. Many homes had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work in the fields, or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice.

When Yamato Take heard this his wrath was kindled, and he said fiercely:

""From the western end of Kiushiu to the eastern corner of Yezo I have subdued all the King's enemies-there is no one who dares to break the laws or to rebel against the King. It is indeed a matter for wonder that here in this place, so near the capital, a wicked monster has dared to take up his abode and be the terror of the King's subjects. Not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk. I will start out and kill it at once."""
story-of-prince-yamato-take,38,"With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain, where the monster was said to live. He climbed up a good distance, when all of a sudden, at a winding in the path, a monster serpent appeared before him and stopped the way.

""This must be the monster,"" said the Prince; ""I do not need my sword for a serpent. I can kill him with my hands.""

He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his bare arms. It was not long before his prodigious strength gained the mastery and the serpent lay dead at his feet. Now a sudden darkness came over the mountain and rain began to fall, so that for the gloom and the rain the Prince could hardly see which way to take. In a short time, however, while he was groping his way down the pass, the weather cleared, and our brave hero was able to make his way quickly down the mountain."
story-of-prince-yamato-take,39,"When he got back he began to feel ill and to have burning pains in his feet, so he knew that the serpent had poisoned him. So great was his suffering that he could hardly move, much less walk, so he had himself carried to a place in the mountains famous for its hot mineral springs, which rose bubbling out of the earth, and almost boiling from the volcanic fires beneath.

Yamato Take bathed daily in these waters, and gradually he felt his strength come again, and the pains left him, till at last one day he found with great joy that he was quite recovered. He now hastened to the temples of Ise, where you will remember that he prayed before undertaking this long expedition. His aunt, priestess of the shrine, who had blessed him on his setting out, now came to welcome him back. He told her of the many dangers he had encountered and of how marvelously his life had been preserved through all-and she praised his courage and his warrior's prowess, and then putting on her most magnificent robes she returned thanks to their ancestress the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, to whose protection they both ascribed the Prince's wonderful preservation.

Here ends the story of Prince Yamato Take of Japan."
story-of-princess-hase,1,"Many, many years ago there lived in Nara, the ancient Capital of Japan, a wise State minister, by name Prince Toyonari Fujiwara. His wife was a noble, good, and beautiful woman called Princess Murasaki (Violet). They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young, and had lived together happily ever since. They had, however, one cause for great sorrow, for as the years went by no child was born to them. This made them very unhappy, for they both longed to see a child of their own who would grow up to gladden their old age, carry on the family name, and keep up the ancestral rites when they were dead. The Prince and his lovely wife, after long consultation and much thought, determined to make a pilgrimage to the temple of Hase-no-Kwannon (Goddess of Mercy at Hase). They believed, according to the beautiful tradition of their religion, that the Mother of Mercy, Kwannon, comes to answer the prayers of mortals in the form that they need the most. Surely after all these years of prayer she would come to them in the form of a beloved child in answer to their special pilgrimage, for that was the greatest need of their two lives. Everything else they had that this life could give them, but it was all as nothing because the cry of their hearts was unsatisfied."
story-of-princess-hase,2,"So the Prince Toyonari and his wife went to the temple of Kwannon at Hase and stayed there for a long time, both daily offering incense and praying to Kwannon, the Heavenly Mother, to grant them the desire of their whole lives. And their prayer was answered.

A daughter was born at last to the Princess Murasaki, and great was the joy of her heart. On presenting the child to her husband, they both decided to call her Hase-Hime, or the Princess of Hase, because she was the gift of the Kwannon at that place. They both reared her with great care and tenderness, and the child grew in strength and beauty."
story-of-princess-hase,3,"When the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her. A little before she breathed her last she called her daughter to her, and gently stroking her head, said:

""Hase-Hime, do you know that your mother cannot live any longer? Though I die, you must grow up a good girl. Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family. Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother. If so do not grieve for me, but look upon your father's second wife as your true mother, and be obedient and filial to both her and your father. Remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors, and to be kind to all those who are under you. Don't forget this. I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman."""
story-of-princess-hase,4,"Hase-Hime listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke, and promised to do all that she was told. There is a proverb which says ""As the soul is at three so it is at one hundred,"" and so Hase-Hime grew up as her mother had wished, a good and obedient little Princess, though she was now too young to understand how great was the loss of her mother.

Not long after the death of his first wife, Prince Toyonari married again, a lady of noble birth named Princess Terute. Very different in character, alas! to the good and wise Princess Murasaki, this woman had a cruel, bad heart. She did not love her step-daughter at all, and was often very unkind to the little motherless girl, saving to herself:

""This is not my child! this is not my child!"""
story-of-princess-hase,5,"But Hase-Hime bore every unkindness with patience. She even waited upon her step-mother kindly and obeyed her in every way and never gave any trouble, just as she had been trained by her own good mother, so that the Lady Terute had no cause for complaint against her.

The little Princess was very diligent, and her favorite studies were music and poetry. She would spend several hours practicing every day, and her father had the most proficient of masters he could find to teach her the koto (Japanese harp), the art of writing letters and verse. When she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her step-mother were summoned to the Palace to perform before the Emperor."
story-of-princess-hase,6,"It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers, and there were great festivities at the Court. The Emperor threw himself into the enjoyment of the season, and commanded that Princess Hase should perform before him on the koto, and that her mother Princess Terute should accompany her on the flute.

The Emperor sat on a raised dais, before which was hung a curtain of finely-sliced bamboo and purple tassels, so that His Majesty might see all and not be seen, for no ordinary subject was allowed to look upon his sacred face."
story-of-princess-hase,7,"Hase-Hime was a skilled musician though so young, and often astonished her masters by her wonderful memory and talent. On this momentous occasion she played well. But Princess Terute, her step-mother, who was a lazy woman and never took the trouble to practice daily, broke down in her accompaniment and had to request one of the Court ladies to take her place. This was a great disgrace, and she was furiously jealous to think that she had failed where her step-daughter succeeded. To make matters worse the Emperor sent many beautiful gifts to the little Princess to reward her for playing so well at the Palace.

There was also now another reason why Princess Terute hated her step-daughter, for she had had the good fortune to have a son born to her, and in her inmost heart she kept saying:

""If only Hase-Hime were not here, my son would have all the love of his father."""
story-of-princess-hase,8,"And never having learned to control herself, she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step-daughter's life.

So one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine. This poisoned wine she put into a bottle. Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine. It was the occasion of the Boys' Festival on the fifth of May, and Hase-Hime was playing with her little brother. All his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them. They were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes."
story-of-princess-hase,9,"""You are both so good and happy."" said the wicked Princess Terute with a smile, ""that I have brought you some sweet wine as a reward-and here are some nice cakes for my good children.""

And she filled two cups from the different bottles.

Hase-Hime, never dreaming of the dreadful part her step-mother was acting, took one of the cups of wine and gave to her little step brother the other that had been poured out for him."
story-of-princess-hase,10,"The wicked woman had carefully marked the poisoned bottle, but on coming into the room she had grown nervous, and pouring out the wine hurriedly had unconsciously given the poisoned cup to her own child. All this time she was anxiously watching the little Princess, but to her amazement no change whatever took place in the young girl's face. Suddenly the little boy screamed and threw himself on the floor, doubled up with pain. His mother flew to him, taking the precaution to upset the two tiny jars of wine which she had brought into the room, and lifted him up. The attendants rushed for the doctor, but nothing could save the child-he died within the hour in his mother's arms. Doctors did not know much in those ancient times, and it was thought that the wine had disagreed with the boy, causing convulsions of which he died."
story-of-princess-hase,11,"Thus was the wicked woman punished in losing her own child when she had tried to do away with her step-daughter. Instead of blaming herself, she began to hate Hase-Hime more than ever in the bitterness and wretchedness of her own heart. She eagerly watched for an opportunity to do her harm, which was, however, long in coming.

When Hase-Hime was thirteen years of age, she had already become mentioned as a poetess of some merit. This was an accomplishment very much cultivated by the women of old Japan and one held in high esteem."
story-of-princess-hase,12,"It was the rainy season at Nara, and floods were reported every day as doing damage in the neighborhood. The river Tatsuta, which flowed through the Imperial Palace grounds, was swollen to the top of its banks. The roaring of the torrents of water rushing along a narrow bed so disturbed the Emperor's rest day and night, that a serious nervous disorder was the result. An Imperial Edict was sent forth to all the Buddhist temples commanding the priests to offer up continuous prayers to Heaven to stop the noise of the flood. But this was of no avail."
story-of-princess-hase,13,"Then it was whispered in Court circles that the Princess Hase, the daughter of Prince Toyonari Fujiwara, second minister at Court, was the most gifted poetess of the day, though still so young, and her masters confirmed the report. Long ago, a beautiful and gifted maiden-poetess had moved Heaven by praying in verse, had brought down rain upon a land famished with drought-so said the ancient biographers of the poetess Ono-no-Komachi. If the Princess Hase were to write a poem and offer it in prayer, might it not stop the noise of the rushing river and remove the cause of the Imperial illness? What the Court said at last reached the ears of the Emperor himself, and he sent an order to the minister Prince Toyonari to this effect."
story-of-princess-hase,14,"Great indeed was Hase-Hime's fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her what was required of her. Heavy, indeed, was the duty that was laid on her young shoulders-that of saving the Emperor's life by the merit of her verse.

At last the day came and her poem was finished. It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust. With her father and attendants and some of the Court officials, she proceeded to the bank of the roaring torrent and raising up her heart to Heaven, she read the poem she had composed, aloud, lifting it heavenwards in her two hands."
story-of-princess-hase,15,"Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round. The waters ceased their roaring, and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer. After this the Emperor soon recovered his health.

His Majesty was highly pleased, and sent for her to the Palace and rewarded her with the rank of Chinjo-that of Lieutenant-General-to distinguish her. From that time she was called Chinjo-hime, or the Lieutenant-General Princess, and respected and loved by all."
story-of-princess-hase,16,"There was only one person who was not pleased at Hase-Hime's success. That one was her stepmother. Forever brooding over the death of her own child whom she had killed when trying to poison her step-daughter, she had the mortification of seeing her rise to power and honor, marked by Imperial favor and the admiration of the whole Court. Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire. Many were the lies she carried to her husband about Hase-Hime, but all to no purpose. He would listen to none of her tales, telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken.

At last the step-mother, seizing the opportunity of her husband's absence, ordered one of her old servants to take the innocent girl to the Hibari Mountains, the wildest part of the country, and to kill her there. She invented a dreadful story about the little Princess, saying that this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family-by killing her."
story-of-princess-hase,17,"Katoda, her vassal, was bound to obey his mistress. Anyhow, he saw that it would be the wisest plan to pretend obedience in the absence of the girl's father. He placed Hase-Hime in a palanquin and accompanied her to the most solitary place he could find in the wild district. The poor child knew there was no good in protesting to her unkind step-mother at being sent away in this strange manner, so she went as she was told.

But the old servant knew that the young Princess was quite innocent of all the things her step-mother had invented to him as reasons for her outrageous orders, and he determined to save her life. Unless he killed her, however, he could not return to his cruel task-mistress, so he decided to stay out in the wilderness. With the help of some peasants he soon built a little cottage, and having sent secretly for his wife to come, these two good old people did all in their power to take care of the now unfortunate Princess. She all the time trusted in her father, knowing that as soon as he returned home and found her absent, he would search for her."
story-of-princess-hase,18,"Prince Toyonari, after some weeks, came home, and was told by his wife that his daughter Hime had done something wrong and had run away for fear of being punished. He was nearly ill with anxiety. Every one in the house told the same story-that Hase-Hime had suddenly disappeared, none of them knew why or whither. For fear of scandal he kept the matter quiet and searched everywhere he could think of, but all to no purpose.

One day, trying to forget his terrible worry, he called all his men together and told them to make ready for a several days' hunt in the mountains. They were soon ready and mounted, waiting at the gate for their lord. He rode hard and fast to the district of the Hibari Mountains, a great company following him. He was soon far ahead of every one, and at last found himself in a narrow picturesque valley."
story-of-princess-hase,19,"Looking round and admiring the scenery, he noticed a tiny house on one of the hills quite near, and then he distinctly heard a beautiful clear voice reading aloud. Seized with curiosity as to who could be studying so diligently in such a lonely spot, he dismounted. Leaving his horse to his groom, he walked up the hillside and approached the cottage. As he drew nearer his surprise increased, for he could see that the reader was a beautiful girl. The cottage was wide open and she was sitting facing the view. Listening attentively, he heard her reading the Buddhist scriptures with great devotion. More and more curious, he hurried on to the tiny gate and entered the little garden, and looking up beheld his lost daughter Hase-Hime. She was so intent on what she was saying that she neither heard nor saw her father till he spoke.

""Hase-Hime!"" he cried, ""it is you, my Hase-Hime!"""
story-of-princess-hase,20,"Taken by surprise, she could hardly realize that it was her own dear father who was calling her, and for a moment she was utterly bereft of the power to speak or move.

""My father, my father! It is indeed you-oh, my father!"" was all she could say, and running to him she caught hold of his thick sleeve, and burying her face burst into a passion of tears.

Her father stroked her dark hair, asking her gently to tell him all that had happened, but she only wept on, and he wondered if he were not really dreaming."
story-of-princess-hase,21,"Then the faithful old servant Katoda came out, and bowing himself to the ground before his master. He poured out the long tale of wrong, telling him all that had happened, and how it was that he found his daughter in such a wild and desolate spot with only two old servants to take care of her.

The Prince's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds. He gave up the hunt at once and hurried home with his daughter. One of the company galloped ahead to inform the household of the glad news, and the step-mother hearing what had happened, and fearful of meeting her husband now that her wickedness was discovered, fled from the house and returned in disgrace to her father's roof, and nothing more was heard of her."
story-of-princess-hase,22,"The old servant Katoda was rewarded with the highest promotion in his master's service. He lived happily to the end of his days, devoted to the little Princess, who never forgot that she owed her life to this faithful retainer. She was no longer troubled by an unkind step-mother, and her days passed happily and quietly with her father.

As Prince Toyonari had no son, he adopted a younger son of one of the Court nobles to be his heir, and to marry his daughter Hase-Hime, and in a few years the marriage took place. Hase-Hime lived to a good old age, and all said that she was the wisest, most devout, and most beautiful mistress that had ever reigned in Prince Toyonari's ancient house. She had the joy of presenting her son, the future lord of the family, to her father just before he retired from active life.

To this day there is preserved a piece of needle-work in one of the Buddhist temples of Kioto. It is a beautiful piece of tapestry, with the figure of Buddha embroidered in the silky threads drawn from the stem of the lotus. This is said to have been the work of the hands of the good Princess Hase."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,1,"There was a man called Odshedoph, or the Child of Strong Desires, who
had a wife and one son. He had withdrawn his family from the village,
where they had spent the winter, to the neighborhood of a distant
forest, where game abounded. This wood was a day's travel from his
winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while
the husband went out to hunt. Early in the evening he returned with a
deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called
Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. The son replied that
it was dark, and he was afraid. His father still urged him, saying that
his mother, as well as himself, was tired, and the distance to the water
very short. But no persuasion could overcome the young man's reluctance.
He refused to go."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,2,"""Ah, my son,"" said the father, at last, ""if you are afraid to go to the
river, you will never kill the Red Head.""

The stripling was deeply vexed by this observation; it seemed to touch
him to the very quick. He mused in silence. He refused to eat, and made
no reply when spoken to. He sat by the lodge door all the night through,
looking up at the stars, and sighing like one sorely distressed.

The next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer, and to
make it into moccasins for him, while he busied himself in preparing a
bow and arrows.

As soon as these were in readiness, he left the lodge one morning, at
sunrise, without saying a word to his father or mother. As he passed
along, he fired one of his arrows into the air, which fell westward. He
took that course, and coming to the spot where the arrow had fallen, he
was rejoiced to find it piercing the heart of a deer."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,3,"He refreshed
himself with a meal of the venison, and the next morning he fired
another arrow. Following its course, after traveling all day he found
that he had transfixed another deer. In this manner he fired four
arrows, and every evening he discovered that he had killed a deer.

By a strange oversight, he left the arrows sticking in the carcasses,
and passed on without withdrawing them. Having in this way no arrow for
the fifth day, he was in great distress at night for the want of food.

At last he threw himself upon the earth in despair, concluding that he
might as well perish there as go further. But he had not lain long
before he heard a hollow rumbling noise, in the ground beneath him, like
that of an earthquake moving slowly along."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,4,"He sprang up, and discovered at a distance the figure of a human being,
walking with a stick. He looked attentively, and saw that the figure was
walking in a wide beaten path in a prairie, leading from a dusky lodge
to a lake, whose waters were black and turbid.

To his surprise, this lodge, which had not been in view when he cast himself upon the ground, was now near at hand. He approached a little nearer, and concealed himself; and in a moment he discovered that the figure was no other than that of the terrible witch, the little old woman who makes war. Her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and solid, and the noise Strong Desire had heard was caused by the striking of her walking staff upon the ground. The top of this staff was decorated with a string of the toes and bills of birds of every kind, who, at every stroke of the stick, fluttered and sung their various notes in concert."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,5,"She entered her lodge and laid off her mantle, which was entirely composed of the scalps of women. Before folding it, she shook it several times, and at every shake the scalps uttered loud shouts of laughter, in which the old hag joined. The boy, who lingered at the door, was greatly alarmed, but he uttered no cry.

After laying by the cloak, she came directly to him. Looking at him steadily, she informed him that she had known him from the time he had left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements. She told him not to fear or despair, for she would be his protector and friend. She invited him into her lodge, and gave him a supper. During the repast, she questioned him as to his motives for visiting her. He related his history, stated the manner in which he had been disgraced, and the difficulties he labored under.

""Now tell me truly,"" said the little old woman who makes war, ""you were afraid to go to the water in the dark."""
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,6,"""I was,"" Strong Desire answered, promptly.

As he replied, the hag waved her staff. The birds set up a clamorous cry, and the mantle shook violently as all the scalps burst into a hideous shout of laughter.

""And are you afraid now,"" she asked again.

""I am,"" again answered Strong Desire, without hesitation.

""But you are not afraid to speak the truth,"" rejoined the little old woman. ""You will be a brave man yet.""

She cheered him with the assurance of her friendship, and began at once to exercise her power upon him. His hair being very short, she took a great leaden comb, and after drawing it through his locks several times, they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman. She then proceeded to dress him as a female, furnishing him with the necessary garments, and tinting his face with colors of the most charming dye."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,7,"She gave him, too, a bowl of shining metal. She directed him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword-grass, and to proceed the next morning to the banks of the lake, which was no other than that over which the Red Head reigned. Now Hah-Undo-Tah, or the Red Head, was a most powerful sorcerer, living upon an island in the centre of his realm of water, and he was the terror of all the country. She informed him that there would be many Indians upon the island, who, as soon as they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with, would come and solicit him to be their wife, and to take him over to the island. These offers he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for himself, she would return to her village. She said, that as soon as the Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which she must embark."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,8,"""On reaching the shore,"" added the little old woman, ""you must consent to be his wife; and in the evening you are to induce him to take a walk out of the village, and when you have reached a lonesome spot, use the first opportunity to cut off his head with the blade of grass.""

She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself to sustain his assumed character of a woman. His fear would scarcely permit him to consent to engage in an adventure attended with so much danger; but the recollection of his father's looks and reproaches of the want of courage, decided him.

Early in the morning he left the lodge of the little old woman who makes war, which was clouded in a heavy brackish fog, so thick and heavy to breathe, that he with difficulty made his way forth. When he turned to look back for it, it was gone.

He took the hard beaten path to the banks of the lake, and made for the water at a point directly opposite the Red Head's lodge."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,9,"Where he now stood it was beautiful day. The heavens were clear, and the sun shone out as brightly to Strong Desire as on the first morning when he had put forth his little head from the door of his father's lodge. He had not been long there, sauntering along the beach, when he displayed the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake. Very soon a number of canoes came off from the island. The men admired his dress, and were charmed with his beauty, and almost with one voice they all made proposals of marriage. These, Strong Desire promptly declined.

When this was reported to Red Head, he ordered his royal bark to be launched by his chosen men of the oar, and crossed over to see this wonderful girl. As they approached the shore, Strong Desire saw that the ribs of the sorcerer's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes, whose heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies. Being invited, he had no sooner stepped into the canoe, than they began to hiss and rattle furiously, which put him in a great fright; but the magician spoke to them, when they became pacified and quiet. Shortly after they were at the landing upon the island. The marriage took place immediately; and the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,10,"As they were sitting in the lodge, surrounded by the friends and relatives, the mother of the Red Head regarded the face of her new daughter-in-law for a long time with fixed attention. From this scrutiny she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to her son. She drew him aside, and disclosed to him her suspicions. This can be no female, said she; she has the figure and manners, the countenance, and more especially the eyes, are beyond a doubt those of a man. Her husband rejected her suspicions, and rebuked her severely for entertaining such notions of her own daughter-in-law. She still urged her doubts, which so vexed the husband that he broke his pipe-stem in her face, and called her an owl.

This act astonished the company, who sought an explanation; and it was no sooner given, than the mock bride, rising with an air of offended dignity, informed the Red Head that after receiving so gross an affront from his relatives she could not think of remaining with him as his wife, but should forthwith return to her own friends."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,11,"With a toss of the head, like that of an angry female, Strong Desire left the lodge, followed by Red Head, and walked away until he came to the beach of the island, near the spot where they had first landed. Red Head entreated him to remain, urging every motive, and making all sorts of magnificent promises-none of which seemed to make the least impression. Strong Desire, Red Head thought, was very hard-hearted. During these appeals they had seated themselves upon the ground, and Red Head, in great affliction, reclined his head upon his fancied wife's lap. Strong Desire now changed his manner, was very kind and soothing, and suggested in the most winning accent that if Red Head would sleep soundly for awhile he might possibly dream himself out of all his troubles. Red Head, delighted at so happy a prospect, said that he would fall asleep immediately.

""You have killed a good many men in your time, Red Head,"" said Strong Desire, by way of suggesting an agreeable train of ideas to the sorcerer.

""Hundreds,"" answered Red Head; ""and what is better, now that I am fairly settled in life by this happy marriage, I shall be able to give my whole attention to massacre."""
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,12,"""And you will kill hundreds more,"" interposed Strong Desire, in the most insinuating manner imaginable.

""Just so, my dear,"" Red Head replied, with a great leer; ""thousands. There will be no end to my delicious murders. I love dearly to kill people. I would like to kill you if you were not my wife.""

""There, there,"" said Strong Desire, with the coaxing air of a little coquette, ""go to sleep; that's a good Red Head.""

No other subject of conversation occurring to the chief, now that he had exhausted the delightful topic of wholesale murder, he straightway fell into a deep sleep.

The chance so anxiously sought for had come; and Strong Desire, with a smiling eye, drawing his blade of grass with lightning swiftness once across the neck of the Red Head, severed the huge and wicked head from the body.

In a moment, stripping off his woman's dress, underneath which he had all along worn his male attire, Strong Desire seized the bleeding trophy, plunged into the lake, and swam safely over to the main shore. He had scarcely reached it, when, looking back, he saw amid the darkness the torches of persons come out in search of the new married couple. He listened until they had found the headless body, and he heard their piercing shrieks of rage and sorrow as he took his way to the lodge of his kind adviser."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,13,"The little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor, and she received Strong Desire with rejoicing. She admired his prudence, and assured him his bravery should never be questioned again. Lifting up the head, which she gazed upon with vast delight, she said he need only have brought the scalp. Cutting off a lock of the hair for herself, she told him he might now return with the head, which would be evidence of an achievement that would cause his own people to respect him.

""In your way home,"" added the little old woman, ""you will meet with but one difficulty. Maunkahkeesh, the Spirit of the Earth, requires an offering or sacrifice from all of her sons who perform extraordinary deeds. As you walk along in a prairie there will be an earthquake; the earth will open and divide the prairie in the middle. Take this partridge and throw it into the opening, and instantly spring over it.""

With many thanks to the little old witch, who had so faithfully befriended him, Strong Desire took leave of her, and having, by the course pointed out, safely passed the earthquake, he arrived near his own village. He secretly hid his precious trophy."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,14,"On entering the village, he found that his parents had returned from the place of their spring encampment by the wood-side, and that they were in heavy sorrowing for their son, whom they supposed to be lost. One and another of the young men had presented themselves to the disconsolate parents, and said, ""Look up, I am your son;"" but when they looked up, they beheld not the familiar face of Strong Desire.

Having been often deceived in this manner, when their own son in truth presented himself they sat with their heads down, and with their eyes nearly blinded with weeping. It was some time before they could be prevailed upon to bestow a glance upon him. It was still longer before they could recognize him as their son who had refused to draw water from the river, at night, for fear, for his countenance was no longer that of a timid stripling; it was that of a man who has seen and done great things, and who has the heart to do greater still."
strong-desire-and-the-red-sorcerer,15,"When he recounted his adventures they believed him mad. The young men laughed at him-him, Strong Desire-who feared to walk to the river at night-time.

He left the lodge, and ere their laughter had ceased, returned with his trophy. He held aloft the head of the Red Sorcerer, with the great ghastly leer which lighted it up before his last sleep, at prospect of a thousand future murders, fresh upon it. It was easily recognized, and the young men who had scoffed at Strong Desire shrunk into the corners out of sight. Strong Desire had conquered the terrible Red Head! All doubts of the truth of his adventures were dispelled.

He was greeted with joy, and placed among the first warriors of the nation. He finally became a chief, and his family were ever after respected and esteemed."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,1,"Once upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was
""Ginger and Pickles.""

It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and Jane
Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.

The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and
Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.

They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,2,"In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly
everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces,
hair-pins and mutton chops.

Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow
tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.

The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,3,"The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of
Ginger.

Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made
his mouth water.

""I cannot bear,"" said he, ""to see them going out at the door carrying
their little parcels."""
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,4,"""I have the same feeling about rats,"" replied Pickles, ""but it would
never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha
Twitchit's.""

""On the contrary, they would go nowhere,"" replied Ginger gloomily.

(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not
give credit.)"
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,5,"Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.

Now the meaning of ""credit"" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap,
instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says
she will pay another time.

And Pickles makes a low bow and says, ""With pleasure, madam,"" and it is
written down in a book.

The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being
afraid of Ginger and Pickles.

But there is no money in what is called the ""till."""
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,6,"The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially
the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for
as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.

But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.

As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat
their own goods.

Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.

They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,7,"When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable
to buy a dog licence.

""It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,"" said Pickles.

""It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence,
and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.""

""It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried
in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;"" said Pickles.
""The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.""

""Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9
for bacon."""
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,8,"""I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,"" replied Ginger.

""And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream
crackers?""

""You have eaten them yourself,"" replied Ginger."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,9,"Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.

They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.

""Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an
ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.""

""What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and
four matches?""

""Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with comp'ts,'"" replied Ginger."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,10,"After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been
pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an
envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!

Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.

""Bite him, Pickles! bite him!"" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel,
""he's only a German doll!""

The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in
his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.

Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice.
He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,11,"At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
The policeman had disappeared.

But the envelope remained.

""Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid
it is a summons,"" said Pickles.

""No,"" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, ""it is the rates and
taxes, 3 pounds, 19 shillings, 11 pence 3 farthings.""

""This is the last straw,"" said Pickles, ""let us close the shop.""

They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the
neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,12,"Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues;
he looks stout and comfortable.

Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.

The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit
immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued
to refuse to give credit.

Of course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fish-man and
Timothy Baker.

But a person cannot live on ""seed wigs"" and sponge-cake and
butter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!"
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,13,"After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints
and candles.

But they did not keep ""self-fitting sixes""; and it takes five mice to
carry one seven inch candle.


Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm
weather.

And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought
back to her with complaints.

And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would
say nothing but ""very snug;"" which is not the way to carry on a retail
business."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,14,"So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster
to say that she was going to re-open the shop--""Henny's Opening Sale!
Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come
buy!""

The poster really was most ticing."
tale-of-ginger-and-pickles,15,"There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with
customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.

Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out
change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.

And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.

There is something to please everybody."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,1,Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard. Timmy Willie was born in a garden. Timmy Willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper. The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper.
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,2,"The gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas-Timmy Willie fell fast asleep."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,3,"He awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles-jolt-jolt-jolt! and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,4,"At last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,5,"Timmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death. Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables. Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,6,"Up jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming ""A mouse! a mouse! Call the cat! Fetch me the poker, Sarah!"" Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,7,"He dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.-""Who in the world is this?"" inquired Johnny Town-mouse. But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,8,"With the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties. Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; but they were too well bred to make personal remarks; only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap?"
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,9,"The dinner was of eight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant. All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners. The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. ""Never mind, they don't belong to us,"" said Johnny."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,10,"""Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?"" It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat. His appetite failed, he felt faint. ""Try some jelly?"" said Johnny Town-mouse."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,11,"""No? Would you rather go to bed? I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow.""The sofa pillow had a hole in it. Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors. But the sofa smelt of cat. Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,12,"It was just the same next day. An excellent breakfast was provided-for mice accustomed to eat bacon; but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,13,"Timmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank. The food disagreed with him; the noise prevented him from sleeping. In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him. He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden. ""It sounds rather a dull place? What do you do when it rains?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,14,"""When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers-roses and pinks and pansies-no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,15,"""There goes that cat again!"" exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse. When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; ""I confess I am a little disappointed; we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William.""""Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; but I do feel so ill,"" said Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,16,"""It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper.""""Oh? Oh!"" cried Timmy Willie.""Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,"" said Johnny rather huffily-""did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,17,"So Timmy Willie said good-bye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,18,"Sometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again. And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,19,The winter passed; the sun came out again; Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass. He had nearly forgotten his visit to town. When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse!
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,20,"Timmy Willie received him with open arms. ""You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun.""""H'm'm! it is a little damp,"" said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,21,"""What is that fearful noise?"" he started violently.""That?"" said Timmy Willie, ""that is only a cow; I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. How are all our friends?"""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,22,"Johnny's account was rather middling. He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; the family had gone to the sea-side for Easter; the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice. There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,23,"""They say we did it; but I know better,"" said Johnny Town-mouse. ""Whatever is that fearful racket?""""That is only the lawn-mower; I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny."""
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,24,"""H'm'm-we shall see by Tuesday week; the hamper is stopped while they are at the sea-side.""""I am sure you will never want to live in town again,"" said Timmy Willie."
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,25,But he did. He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; he said it was too quiet!!
tale-of-johnny-town-mouse,26,"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,1,"Once upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs.Tittlemouse.She lived in a bank under a hedge.Such a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages,leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst theroots of the hedge."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,2,"There was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder.Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a littlebox bed!Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse,always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.""Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering herdust-pan."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,3,"And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.""Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to yourchildren!""Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.""Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?""""Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my niceclean house!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,4,"She bundled the spider out at a window.He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetchcherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.""I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? Iam sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,5,"Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!""said the bumble bee.Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had abroom.""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. Butwhat are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, andsay Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"" Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.""Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. Shesidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had beenused for acorns.Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroomought to have been empty.But it was full of untidy dry moss."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,6,"Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other beesput their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.""I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!"" saidMrs. Tittlemouse. ""I will have them turned out--"" ""Buzz! Buzz!Buzzz!""--""I wonder who would help me?"" ""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!""--""I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.""Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.When she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fatvoice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs andsmiling, with his feet on the fender.He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,7,"""How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!""""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile anddry myself,"" said Mr. Jackson.He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs.Tittlemouse went round with a mop.He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take somedinner?First she offered him cherry-stones. ""Thank you, thank you, Mrs.Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson.He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not atooth in his head."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,8,"Then she offered him thistle-down seed--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff,pouff, puff!"" said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over theroom.""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what Ireally--_really_ should like--would be a little dish of honey!""""I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson,"" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"" said the smiling Mr.Jackson, ""I can _smell_ it; that is why I came to call.""Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into thecupboards.Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wetfootmarks off the parlour floor."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,9,"When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards,he began to walk down the passage.""Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!""""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!""First he squeezed into the pantry.""Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?""There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two ofthem got away; but the littlest one he caught."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,10,"Then he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar;but she flew away out of the window.""Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty ofvisitors!""""And without any invitation!"" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.They went along the sandy passage--""Tiddly widdly--"" ""Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!""He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her downagain.""I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,"" said Mr.Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.""Get out, you nasty old toad!"" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.""I shall go distracted!"" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,11,"She shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out thebees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.But the untidiness was something dreadful--""Never did I see such amess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big andlittle dirty feet--all over my nice clean house!""She gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the frontdoor.""I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"""
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,12,"She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from thestoreroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleepin her chair, and then she went to bed.""Will it ever be tidy again?"" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning whichlasted a fortnight.She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniturewith beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to fiveother little mice, without Mr. Jackson.He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in atthe door."
tale-of-mrs.tittlemouse,13,"So they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey-dew through the window,and he was not at all offended.He sat outside in the sun, and said--""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your verygood health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"""
tale-of-tom-kitten,1,"Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.But one day their mother-Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit-expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived."
tale-of-tom-kitten,2,"First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).Then she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens)."
tale-of-tom-kitten,3,"Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas."
tale-of-tom-kitten,4,"Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again.When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.""Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks."""
tale-of-tom-kitten,5,"Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.When they stood up there were several green smears!""Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,"" said Moppet.They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road."
tale-of-tom-kitten,6,"Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst."
tale-of-tom-kitten,7,"While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised."
tale-of-tom-kitten,8,"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.""Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck,"" said Moppet-""Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!"""
tale-of-tom-kitten,9,"Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.But he put them on himself! They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.""It's a very fine morning!"" said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck."
tale-of-tom-kitten,10,"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step-pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on."
tale-of-tom-kitten,11,"She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true."
tale-of-tom-kitten,12,"Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!"
tale-of-tom-kitten,13,"As for the Puddle-Ducks-they went into a pond.The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons."
tale-of-tom-kitten,14,"And Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."
the-abbot-of-inisfalen,1,"The Abbot of Inisfalen awoke before dawn of day.
Under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray.
 The lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep.
 And wrapt in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep.
 Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac when the dawn was dim and gray.
The prayers of his holy office he faithfully began to say.
 Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac while the dawn was waxing red.
 And for his sins' forgiveness a solemn prayer he said.
 Low kneel'd that holy Abbot while the dawn was waxing clear.
 And he pray'd with loving-kindness for his convent-brethren dear.
 Low kneel'd that blessed Abbot while the dawn was waxing bright.
 He pray'd a great prayer for Ireland, he pray'd with all his might.
Low kneel'd that good old Father while the sun began to dart.
He pray'd a prayer for all men, he pray'd it from his heart.
His blissful soul was in Heaven, though a breathing man was he.
He was out of Time's dominion, so far as the living may be."
the-abbot-of-inisfalen,2,"The Abbot of Inisfalen arose upon his feet.
 He heard a small bird singing, and O but it sung sweet!
  It sung upon a holly-bush, this little snow-white bird.
 A song so full of gladness he never before had heard.
  It sung upon a hazel. it sung upon a thorn.
  He had never heard such music since the hour that he was born.
  It sung upon a sycamore. It sung upon a briar.
  To follow the song and hearken this Abbot could never tire.
  Till at last he well bethought him, he might no longer stay.
  So he blessed the little white singing-bird, and gladly went his way."
the-abbot-of-inisfalen,3,"But, when he came to his Abbey, he found a wondrous change.
  He saw no friendly faces there, for every face was strange.
  The strange men spoke unto him. And he heard from all and each
  The foreign tongue of the Sassenach, not wholesome Irish speech.
  Then the oldest monk came forward. In Irish tongue, he spoke:
  ""You wearest the holy Augustine's dress, and who hath given it to you?""
  ""I wear the holy Augustine's dress, and Cormac is my name.
  The Abbot of this good Abbey by grace of God I am.
  I went forth to pray, at the dawn of day. And when my prayers were said,
  I hearken'd awhile to a little bird that sung above my head.""
  The monks to him made answer, ""Two hundred years have gone over,
  Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate, and never was heard of
    more.
  Matthias now is our Abbot, and twenty have pass'd away.
  The stranger is lord of Ireland. We live in an evil day.""
  ""Days will come and go."" he said, ""and the world will pass away.
  In Heaven a day is a thousand years, a thousand years are a day."""
the-abbot-of-inisfalen,4,"""Now, give me absolution, for my time is come,"" said he.
  And they gave him absolution as speedily as might be.
  Then, close outside the window, the sweetest song they heard.
  That ever yet since the world began was uttered by any bird.
  The monks looked out and saw the bird. Its feathers all white and clean.
  And there in a moment, beside it, another white bird was seen.
  Those two they sang together, waved their white wings, and fled,
  flew aloft, and vanished. But the good old man was dead.
  They buried his blessed body where lake and greensward meet.
  A carven cross above his head, a holly-bush at his feet.
  Where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies,
  the purple peaks of Killarney from ancient woods arise."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,1,"Long ago a poor widow woman lived down by the iron forge near
Enniscorthy, and she was so poor, she had no clothes to put on her son.
So, she used to fix him in the ash-hole, near the fire, and pile the warm
ashes about him. Accordingly, as he grew up, she sunk the pit
deeper. At last, by hook or by crook, she got a goat-skin, and fastened
it round his waist, and he felt quite grand, and took a walk down the
street. So says she to him next morning, ""Tom, you thief, you never done
any good yet, and six-foot high, and past nineteen. Take that rope and
bring me a bresna from the wood."" ""Never say't twice, mother,"" says
Tom; ""here goes.""

When he had it gathered and tied, what should come up but a big
joiant, nine-foot high, and made a lick of a club at him. Well become
Tom, he jumped a-one side and picked up a ram-pike. The first crack
he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod. ""If you have e'er a
prayer,"" says Tom, ""now's the time to say it, before I make brishe of
you."" ""I have no prayers,"" says the giant, ""but if you spare my life
I'll give you that club. As long as you keep from sin you'll win
every battle you ever fight with it.""

Tom made no bones about letting him off. As soon as he got the club
in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the
kippeen, and says, ""Bresna, I had a great trouble gathering you, and run
the risk of my life for you. The least you can do is to carry me home.""
And, sure enough, the wind of the word was all it wanted. It went off
through the wood, groaning and cracking till it came to the widow's
door."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,2,"Well, when the sticks were all burned Tom was sent off again to pick
more. This time he had to fight with a giant with two heads on him.
Tom had a little more trouble with him--that's all. The prayers he
said was to give Tom a fife that nobody could help dancing when he was
playing it. Begonies, he made the big faggot dance home, with himself
sitting on it. Well, if you were to count all the steps from this to
Dublin, dickens a bit you'd ever arrive there. The next giant was a
beautiful boy with three heads on him. He had neither prayers nor
catechism no more nor the others. So he gave Tom a bottle of green
ointment that wouldn't let you be burned, nor scalded, nor wounded. ""And
now,"" says he, ""there's no more of us. You may come and gather sticks
here till little Lunacy Day in harvest without giant or fairy man to
disturb you.""

Well, now, Tom was prouder nor ten paycocks, and used to take a walk
down street in the heel of the evening. Some of the little boys had
no more manners nor if they were Dublin jackeens, and put out their
tongues at Tom's club and Tom's goat-skin. He didn't like that at all,
and it would be mean to give one of them a clout. At last, what should
come through the town but a kind of bellman, only it's a big bugle he
had, and a huntsman's cap on his head, and a kind of painted shirt. So
this--he wasn't a bellman, and I don't know what to call him--bugleman,
maybe--proclaimed that the King of Dublin's daughter was so melancholy
that she didn't give a laugh for seven years, and that her father would
grant her in marriage to whoever would make her laugh three times.
""That's the very thing for me to try,"" says Tom. So, without burning
any more daylight, he kissed his mother, curled his club at the little
boys, and he set off along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,3,"At last Tom came to one of the city gates, and the guards laughed and
cursed at him instead of letting him through. Tom stood it all for a
little time, but at last one of them--out of fun, as he said--drove his
bagnet half an inch or so into his side. Tom did nothing but take the
fellow by the scruff of his neck and the waistband of his corduroys and
fling him into the canal. Some ran to pull the fellow out, and others to
let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers. But a tap
from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones,
and they were soon begging him to stay his hands.

So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palace
yard. There was the King and the Queen, and the princess in a
gallery, looking at all sorts of wrestling and sword-playing, and
rinka-fadhas (long dances) and mumming, all to please the princess. But not a smile came over her handsome face.

Well, they all stopped when they seen the young giant, with his boy's
face and long black hair, and his short curly beard--for his poor mother
couldn't afford to buy razhurs--and his great strong arms and bare
legs, and no covering but the goat-skin that reached from his waist to
his knees. But an envious wizened basthard of a fellow, with a red
head, that wished to be married to the princess, and didn't like how she
opened her eyes at Tom, came forward, and asked his business very
snappishly."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,4,"""My business,"" says Tom, says he, ""is to make the beautiful
princess, God bless her, laugh three times."" ""Do you see all them merry
fellows and skilful swordsmen,"" says the other, ""that could eat you up
with a grain of salt, and not a mother's soul of them ever got a laugh
from her these seven years?"" So the fellows gathered round Tom, and the
bad man aggravated him till he told them he didn't care a pinch of snuff
for the whole bilin' of 'em. Let 'em come on, six at a time, and try
what they could do. The King, that was too far off to hear what they
were saying, asked what did the stranger want. ""He wants,"" says the
red-headed fellow, ""to make hares of your best men."" ""Oh!"" says the
King, ""if that's the way, let one of 'em turn out and try his mettle.""
So one stood forward, with sword and pot-lid, and made a cut at Tom.
He struck the fellow's elbow with the club, and up over their heads flew
the sword, and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a thump he
got on the helmet. Another took his place, and another, and another, and
then half a dozen at once, and Tom sent swords, helmets, shields, and
bodies rolling over and over, and themselves bawling out that they were
kilt, and disabled, and damaged, and rubbing their poor elbows and hips,
and limping away. Tom contrived not to kill anyone. The princess was
so amused that she let a great sweet laugh out of her that was heard all
over the yard. ""King of Dublin,"" says Tom, ""I've quarter of your
daughter."" And the King didn't know whether he was glad or sorry, and
all the blood in the princess's heart run into her cheeks."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,5,"So there was no more fighting that day, and Tom was invited to dine with
the royal family. Next day Redhead told Tom of a wolf, the size of a
yearling heifer, that used to be serenading (sauntering) about the
walls, and eating people and cattle; and said what a pleasure it would
give the King to have it killed. ""With all my heart,"" says Tom. ""Send a
jackeen to show me where he lives, and we'll see how he behaves to a
stranger."" The princess was not well pleased, for Tom looked a different
person with fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long, curly
hair; and besides, he'd got one laugh out of her. However, the King gave
his consent. In an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking in
the palace yard, and Tom a step or two behind, with his club on his
shoulder, just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb. The King
and Queen and princess were safe up in their gallery, but the officers
and people of the court that were padrowling about the great bawn,
when they saw the big baste coming in gave themselves up, and began to
make for doors and gates. The wolf licked his chops, as if he was
saying, ""Wouldn't I enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yez!"" The King
shouted out, ""O Gilla na Chreck an Gour, take away that terrible wolf,
and you must have all my daughter."" But Tom didn't mind him a bit. He
pulled out his flute and began to play like vengeance. Dickens a man
or boy in the yard but began shovelling away heel and toe, and the wolf
himself was obliged to get on his hind legs and dance Tatther Jack
Walsh along with the rest. A good deal of the people got inside and
shut the doors, the way the hairy fellow wouldn't pin them. But Tom kept
playing, and the outsiders kept shouting and dancing, and the wolf kept
dancing and roaring with the pain his legs were giving him: and all the
time he had his eyes on Redhead, who was shut out along with the rest."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,6,"Wherever Redhead went the wolf followed, and kept one eye on him and the
other on Tom, to see if he would give him leave to eat him. But Tom
shook his head, and never stopped the tune. Redhead never stopped
dancing and bawling and the wolf dancing and roaring, one leg up and the
other down, and he ready to drop out of his standing from fair
tiresomeness.

When the princess seen that there was no fear of anyone being kilt she
was so divarted by the stew that Redhead was in that she gave another
great laugh; and well become Tom, out he cried, ""King of Dublin, I have
two quarters of your daughter."" ""Oh, quarters or alls,"" says the King,
""put away that divel of a wolf and we'll see about it."" So Gilla put his
flute in his pocket, and says he to the baste that was sittin' on his
currabingo ready to faint, ""Walk off to your mountains, my fine
fellow, and live like a respectable baste. If ever I find you come
within seven miles of any town----"" He said no more, but spit in his
fist, and gave a flourish of his club. It was all the poor divel wanted.
He put his tail between his legs and took to his pumps without looking
at man nor mortial, and neither sun, moon, nor stars ever saw him in
sight of Dublin again.

At dinner everyone laughed but the foxy fellow. Sure enough, he was
laying out how he'd settle poor Tom next day. ""Well, to be sure!"" says
he, ""King of Dublin, you are in luck. There's the Danes moidhering us to
no end. D---- run to Lusk wid 'em! and if anyone can save us from 'em it
is this gentleman with the goat-skin. There is a flail hangin' on the
collar-beam in Hell, and neither Dane nor Devil can stand before it.""
""So,"" says Tom to the King, ""will you let me have the other half of the
princess if I bring you the flail?"" ""No, no,"" says the princess, ""I'd
rather never be your wife than see you in that danger."""
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,7,"But Redhead whispered and nudged Tom about how shabby it would look to
reneague the adventure. So he asked him which way he was to go, and
Redhead directed him through a street where a great many bad women
lived, and a great many shibbeen houses were open, and away he set.

Well, he travelled and travelled till he came in sight of the walls of
Hell; and, bedad, before he knocked at the gates, he rubbed himself over
with the greenish ointment. When he knocked a hundred little imps popped
their heads out through the bars, and axed him what he wanted. ""I want
to speak to the big divel of all,"" says Tom: ""open the gate.""

It wasn't long till the gate was thrune open, and the Ould Boy
received Tom with bows and scrapes, and axed his business. ""My business
isn't much,"" says Tom. ""I only came for the loan of that flail that I
see hanging on the collar-beam for the King of Dublin to give a
thrashing to the Danes."" ""Well,"" says the other, ""the Danes is much
better customers to me. But, since you walked so far, I won't refuse.
Hand that flail,"" says he to a young imp. He winked the far-off eye
at the same time."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,8,"So while some were barring the gates, the young devil
climbed up and took down the iron flail that had the handstaff and
booltheen both made out of red-hot iron. The little vagabond was
grinning to think how it would burn the hands off of Tom, but the
dickens a burn it made on him, no more nor if it was a good oak sapling.
""Thankee,"" says Tom; ""now would you open the gate for a body and I'll
give you no more trouble."" ""Oh, tramp!"" says Ould Nick, ""is that the way?
It is easier getting inside them gates than getting out again. Take that
tool from him, and give him a dose of the oil of stirrup."" So one fellow
put out his claws to seize on the flail, but Tom gave him such a welt of
it on the side of his head that he broke off one of his horns, and made
him roar like a divel as he was. Well, they rushed at Tom, but he gave
them, little and big, such a thrashing as they didn't forget for a
while. At last says the ould thief of all, rubbing his elbows, ""Let the
fool out; and woe to whoever lets him in again, great or small.""

So out marched Tom and away with him, without minding the shouting and
cursing they kept up at him from the tops of the walls. And when he got
home to the big bawn of the palace, there never was such running and
racing as to see himself and the flail."
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,9,"When he had his story told he
laid down the flail on the stone steps, and bid no one for their lives
to touch it. If the King and Queen and princess made much of him before
they made ten times as much of him now; but Redhead, the mean
scruff-hound, stole over, and thought to catch hold of the flail to make
an end of him. His fingers hardly touched it, when he let a roar out of
him as if heaven and earth were coming together, and kept flinging his
arms about and dancing that it was pitiful to look at him. Tom run at
him as soon as he could rise, caught his hands in his own two, and
rubbed them this way and that, and the burning pain left them before you
could reckon one. Well, the poor fellow, between the pain that was only
just gone, and the comfort he was in, had the comicalest face that ever
you see; it was such a mixerum-gatherum of laughing and crying. Everyone
burst out a laughing--the princess could not stop no more than the
rest--and then says Gilla, or Tom, ""Now, ma'am, if there were fifty
halves of you I hope you'll give me them all."" Well, the princess had no
mock modesty about her. She looked at her father, and, by my word, she
came over to Gilla and put her two delicate hands into his two rough
ones, and I wish it was myself was in his shoes that day!"
the-adventures-of-gilla-na-chreck-an-gour,10,"Tom would not bring the flail into the palace. You may be sure no other
body went near it; and when the early risers were passing next morning
they found two long clefts in the stone where it was, after burning
itself an opening downwards, nobody could tell how far. But a messenger
came in at noon and said that the Danes were so frightened when they
heard of the flail coming into Dublin that they got into their ships and
sailed away.

Well, I suppose before they were married Gilla got some man like Pat
Mara of Tomenine to larn him the ""principles of politeness,"" fluxions,
gunnery, and fortifications, decimal fractions, practice, and the
rule-of-three direct, the way he'd be able to keep up a conversation
with the royal family. Whether he ever lost his time larning them
sciences, I'm not sure, but it's as sure as fate that his mother never
more saw any want till the end of her days."
the-believing-husbands,1,"Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was
seeking a wife. Of all the maidens round about none pleased him
as well as the only daughter of a farmer. The girl was willing and the
father was willing. Very soon they were married and went to live at
the farm. By and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and
pile them up to dry, so that they might have fires in the winter. So
on a fine day the girl and her husband, and the father and his wife all
went out upon the moor."
the-believing-husbands,2,"They worked hard for many hours. At length grew hungry, so the young
woman was sent home to bring them food, and also to give the horses
their dinner. When she went into the stables, she suddenly saw the heavy
pack-saddle of the speckled mare just over her head. She jumped and
said to herself:

'Suppose that pack-saddle were to fall and kill me, how dreadful it
would be!' and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much
afraid of, and began to cry."
the-believing-husbands,3,"Now the others out on the moor grew hungrier and hungrier.

'What can have become of her?' asked they. At length the mother
declared that she would wait no longer, and must go and see what had
happened.

As the bride was nowhere in the kitchen or the dairy, the old woman went
into the stable. She found her daughter weeping bitterly."
the-believing-husbands,4,"'What is the matter, my dove?' and the girl answered, between her sobs:

'When I came in and saw the pack-saddle over my head, I thought how
dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me.' She cried louder
than before.

The old woman struck her hands together: 'Ah, to think of it! if that
were to be, what should I do?' She sat down by her daughter. They both wrung their hands and let their tears flow."
the-believing-husbands,5,"'Something strange must have occurred,' exclaimed the old farmer on the
moor, who by this time was not only hungry, but cross. 'I must go after
them.' And he went and found them in the stable.

'What is the matter?' asked he.

'Oh!' replied his wife, 'when our daughter came home, did she not see
the pack-saddle over her head. She thought how dreadful it would be
if it were to fall and kill her.'

'Ah, to think of it!' exclaimed he, striking his hands together. He
sat down beside them and wept too."
the-believing-husbands,6,"As soon as night fell the young man returned full of hunger. There
they were, all crying together in the stable.

'What is the matter?' asked he.

'When thy wife came home,' answered the farmer, 'she saw the pack-saddle
over her head. She thought how dreadful it would be if it were to
fall and kill her.'

'Well, but it didn't fall,' replied the young man. He went off to
the kitchen to get some supper, leaving them to cry as long as they
liked."
the-believing-husbands,7,"The next morning he got up with the sun, and said to the old man and to
the old woman and to his wife:

'Farewell: my foot shall not return to the house till I have found other
three people as silly as you.' He walked away till he came to the
town, and seeing the door of a cottage standing open wide. He entered.
No man was present, but only some women spinning at their wheels.

'You do not belong to this town,' said he.

'You speak truth,' they answered, 'nor you either?'

'I do not,' replied he, 'but is it a good place to live in?'"
the-believing-husbands,8,"The women looked at each other.

'The men of the town are so silly that we can make them believe anything
we please,' said they.

'Well, here is a gold ring,' replied he, 'and I will give it to the one
amongst you who can make her husband believe the most impossible thing.'
He left them."
the-believing-husbands,9,"As soon as the first husband came home his wife said to him:

'Thou art sick!'

'Am I?' asked he.

'Yes, thou art,' she answered; 'take off thy clothes and lie down.'"
the-believing-husbands,10,"So he did. When he was in his bed his wife went to him and said:

'Thou art dead.'

'Oh, am I?' asked he.

'Thou art,' said she; 'shut thine eyes and stir neither hand nor foot.'"
the-believing-husbands,11,"And dead he felt sure he was.

Soon the second man came home. His wife said to him:

'You are not my husband!'

'Oh, am I not?' asked he.

'No, it is not you,' answered she. He went away and slept in the
wood."
the-believing-husbands,12,"When the third man arrived his wife gave him his supper. After that
he went to bed, just as usual. The next morning a boy knocked at the
door, bidding him attend the burial of the man who was dead. He was
just going to get up when his wife stopped him."
the-believing-husbands,13,"'Time enough,' said she. He lay still till he heard the funeral
passing the window.

'Now rise, and be quick,' called the wife. The man jumped out of bed
in a great hurry, and began to look about him.

'Why, where are my clothes?' asked he.

'Silly that you are, they are on your back, of course,' answered the
woman.

'Are they?' said he.

'They are,' said she, 'and make haste lest the burying be ended before
you get there.'"
the-believing-husbands,14,"Then off he went, running hard. When the mourners saw a man coming
towards them with nothing on but his nightshirt, they forgot in their
fright what they were there for, and fled to hide themselves. And the
naked man stood alone at the head of the coffin.

Very soon a man came out of the wood and spoke to him."
the-believing-husbands,15,"'Do you know me?'

'Not I,' answered the naked man. 'I do not know you.'

'But why are you naked?' asked the first man.

'Am I naked? My wife told me that I had all my clothes on,' answered he.

'And my wife told me that I myself was dead,' said the man in the
coffin."
the-believing-husbands,16,"But at the sound of his voice the two men were so terrified that they
ran straight home. The man in the coffin got up and followed them. It was his wife that gained the gold ring, as he had been sillier than the other two."
the-bones-of-djulung,1,"In a beautiful island that lies in the southern seas, where chains of
gay orchids bind the trees together. The days and nights are equally
long and nearly equally hot. There once lived a family of seven sisters.
Their father and mother were dead, and they had no brothers, so the
eldest girl ruled over the rest. They all did as she bade them. One
sister had to clean the house. A second carried water from the spring
in the forest. A third cooked their food, while to the youngest fell the
hardest task of all. She had to cut and bring home the wood which
was to keep the fire continually burning. This was very hot and tiring
work. When she had fed the fire and heaped up in a corner the sticks
that were to supply it till the next day, she often threw herself down
under a tree, and went sound asleep.

One morning, however, as she was staggering along with her bundle on her
back, she thought that the river which flowed past their hut looked so
cool and inviting. She determined to bathe in it, instead of taking
her usual nap. Hastily piling up her load by the fire, and thrusting
some sticks into the flame. She ran down to the river and jumped in. How
delicious it was diving and swimming and floating in the dark forest,
where the trees were so thick that you could hardly see the sun! But
after a while she began to look about her. Her eyes fell on a little
fish that seemed made out of a rainbow. So brilliant were the colours he
flashed out."
the-bones-of-djulung,2,"'I should like him for a pet,' thought the girl. The next time the
fish swam by, she put out her hand and caught him. Then she ran along
the grassy path till she came to a cave in front of which a stream fell
over some rocks into a basin. Here she put her little fish, whose name
was Djulung-djulung, and promising to return soon and bring him some
dinner. She went away.

By the time she got home, the rice for their dinner was ready cooked. The eldest sister gave the other six their portions in wooden bowls.
But the youngest did not finish hers, and when no one was looking, stole
off to the fountain in the forest where the little fish was swimming
about.

'See! I have not forgotten you,' she cried. One by one she let
the grains of rice fall into the water, where the fish gobbled them up
greedily. He had never tasted anything so nice.

'That is all for to-day,' she said at last, 'but I will come again
to-morrow,' and biding him good-bye she went down the path.

Now the girl did not tell her sisters about the fish, but every day she
saved half of her rice to give him, and called him softly in a little
song she had made for herself. If she sometimes felt hungry, no one knew
of it, and, indeed, she did not mind that much, when she saw how the
fish enjoyed it. And the fish grew fat and big, but the girl grew thin
and weak. The loads of wood felt heavier every day. At last her
sisters noticed it."
the-bones-of-djulung,3,"Then they took counsel together, and watched her to see what she did. One of them followed her to the fountain where Djulung lived, and saw her give him all the rice she had saved from her breakfast.
Hastening home the sister told the others what she had witnessed, and
that a lovely fat fish might be had for the catching. So the eldest
sister went and caught him. He was boiled for supper, but the
youngest sister was away in the woods, and did not know anything about
it.

Next morning she went as usual to the cave, and sang her little song,
but no Djulung came to answer it. Twice and thrice she sang. Then she threw
herself on her knees by the edge, and peered into the dark water, but
the trees cast such a deep shadow that her eyes could not pierce it.

'Djulung cannot be dead, or his body would be floating on the surface,'
she said to herself, and rising to her feet she set out homewards,
feeling all of a sudden strangely tired.

'What is the matter with me?' she thought, but somehow or other she
managed to reach the hut, and threw herself down in a corner, where she
slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her."
the-bones-of-djulung,4,"At length, one morning early, a cock began to crow so loud that
she could sleep no longer and as he continued to crow she seemed to
understand what he was saying. He was telling her that Djulung
was dead, killed and eaten by her sisters. His bones lay buried
under the kitchen fire. Very softly she got up, and took up the large
stone under the fire. She was creeping out carried the bones to the cave
by the fountain, where she dug a hole and buried them anew. And as she
scooped out the hole with a stick she sang a song, bidding the bones
grow till they became a tree. A tree that reached up so high into the
heavens that its leaves would fall across the sea into another island,
whose king would pick them up.

As there was no Djulung to give her rice to, the girl soon became fat
again. As she was able to do her work as of old, her sisters did not
trouble about her. They never guessed that when she went into the forest
to gather her sticks. She never failed to pay a visit to the tree, which
grew taller and more wonderful day by day. Never was such a tree seen
before. Its trunk was of iron, its leaves were of silk, its flowers of
gold, and its fruit of diamonds. One evening, though the girl did
not know it, a soft breeze took one of the leaves, and blew it across
the sea to the feet of one of the king's attendants."
the-bones-of-djulung,5,"'What a curious leaf! I have never beheld one like it before. I must
show it to the king,' he said. When the king saw it he declared he
would never rest until he had found the tree which bore it, even if he
had to spend the rest of his life in visiting the islands that lay all
round. Happily for him, he began with the island that was nearest. 
Here in the forest he suddenly saw standing before him the iron tree.
Its boughs covered with shining leaves like the one he carried about
him.

'But what sort of a tree is it, and how did it get here?' he asked of
the attendants he had with him. No one could answer him. As they
were about to pass out of the forest a little boy went by, and the king
stopped and inquired if there was anyone living in the neighbourhood
whom he might question.

'Seven girls live in a hut down there,' replied the boy, pointing with
his finger to where the sun was setting.

'Then go and bring them here, and I will wait,' said the king. The
boy ran off and told the sisters that a great chief, with strings of
jewels round his neck, had sent for them."
the-bones-of-djulung,6,"Pleased and excited the six elder sisters at once followed the boy, but
the youngest, who was busy, and who did not care about strangers, stayed
behind, to finish the work she was doing. The king welcomed the girls
eagerly, and asked them all manner of questions about the tree. As
they had never even heard of its existence, they could tell him nothing.
'And if we, who live close by the forest, do not know, you may be sure
no one does,' added the eldest, who was rather cross at finding this was
all that the king wanted of them.

'But the boy told me there were seven of you, and there are only six
here,' said the king.

'Oh, the youngest is at home, but she is always half asleep, and is of
no use except to cut wood for the fire,' replied they in a breath.

'That may be, but perhaps she dreams,' answered the king. 'Anyway, I
will speak to her also.' Then he signed to one of his attendants, who
followed the path that the boy had taken to the hut.

Soon the man returned, with the girl walking behind him. And as soon as
she reached the tree it bowed itself to the earth before her, and she
stretched out her hand and picked some of its leaves and flowers and
gave them to the king.

'The maiden who can work such wonders is fitted to be the wife of the
greatest chief,' he said. He married her, and took her with him
across the sea to his own home, where they lived happily for ever after."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,1,"At the time when the animals reigned in the earth, they had killed all the people but a girl and her little brother. These two were living in fear, in an out-of-the-way place. The boy was a perfect little pigmy, and never grew beyond the size of a mere infant. The girl increased with her years, so that the task of providing food and shelter fell wholly upon her. She went out daily to get wood for the lodge-fire, and she took her little brother with her that no mishap might befall him. He was too little to leave alone. A big bird, of a mischievous disposition, might have flown away with him. She made him a bow and arrows, and said to him one day, ""My little brother, I will leave you behind where I have been gathering the wood. You must hide yourself, and you will soon see the snow-birds come and pick the worms out of the logs which I have piled up. Shoot one of them and bring it home.""

He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but he came home unsuccessful. His sister told him that he must not despair, but try again the next day."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,2,"She accordingly left him at the gathering-place of the wood, and returned to the lodge. Toward night-fall she heard his little footsteps crackling through the snow. He hurried in and threw down, with an air of triumph, one of the birds which he had killed. ""My sister,"" said he, ""I wish you to skin it, and stretch the skin, and when I have killed more, I will have a coat made out of them.""

""But what shall we do with the body?"" said she; for they had always up to that time lived upon greens and berries.

""Cut it in two,"" he answered, ""and season our pottage with one half of it at a time.""

It was their first dish of game, and they relished it greatly.

The boy kept on in his efforts, and in the course of time he killed ten birds-out of the skins of which his sister made him a little coat. Being very small, he had a very pretty coat, and a bird skin to spare."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,3,"""Sister,"" said he, one day, as he paraded up and down before the lodge, enjoying his new coat, and fancifying himself the greatest little fellow in the world-as he was, for there was no other beside him-""My sister, are we really alone in the world, or are we playing at it? Is there nobody else living? And, tell me, was all this great broad earth and this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl like you and me?""

She told him, by no means that there were many folks very unlike a harmless girl and boy, such as they were, who lived in a certain other quarter of the earth, who had killed off all of their kinsfolk. That if he would live blameless and not endanger his life, he must never go where they were. This only served to inflame the boy's curiosity. He soon after took his bow and arrows and went in that direction. After walking a long time and meeting no one, he became tired, and stretched himself upon a high green knoll where the day's warmth had melted off the snow."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,4,"It was a charming place to lie upon, and he fell asleep. While sleeping, the sun beat so hot upon him that it not only singed his bird-skin coat, but it so shrivelled and shrunk and tightened it upon the little boy's body, as to wake him up.

When he felt how the sun had seared and the mischief its fiery beams had played with the coat he was so proud of, he flew into a great passion, and berated the sun in a terrible way for a little boy no higher than a man's knee. He vowed fearful things against it.

""Do not think you are too high,"" said he; ""I shall revenge myself. Oh, sun! I will have you for a plaything yet.""

On coming home he gave an account of his misfortune to his sister, and bitterly bewailed the spoiling of his new coat. He would not eat-not so much as a single berry. He lay down as one that fasts; nor did he move nor change his manner of lying for ten full days, though his sister strove to prevail on him to rise. At the end of ten days he turned over, and then he lay full ten days on the other side."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,5,"When he got up he was very pale, but very resolute too. He bade his sister make a snare, for, he informed her, that he meant to catch the sun. She said she had nothing. But after awhile she brought forward a deer's sinew which the father had left, and which she soon made into a string suitable for a noose. The moment she showed it to him he was quite angry, and told her that would not do, and directed her to find something else. She said she had nothing-nothing at all. At last she thought of the bird-skin that was left over when the coat was made; and this she wrought into a string. With this the little boy was more vexed than before. ""The sun has had enough of my bird-skins,"" he said; ""find something else."" She went out of the lodge saying to herself, ""Was there ever so obstinate a boy?"" She did not dare to answer this time that she had nothing. Luckily she thought of her own beautiful hair, and pulling some of it from among her locks, she quickly braided it into a cord. Upon returning, she handed it to her brother."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,6,"The moment his eye fell upon this jet black braid he was delighted. ""This will do,"" he said. He immediately began to run it back and forth through his hands as swiftly as he could. As he drew it forth, he tried its strength. He said again, ""this will do;"" and winding it in a glossy coil about his shoulders, he set out a little after midnight. His object was to catch the sun before he rose. He fixed his snare firmly on a spot just where the sun must strike the land as it rose above the earth. Sure enough, he caught the sun, so that it was held fast in the cord and did not rise.

The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great commotion. They had no light. They ran to and fro, calling out to each other, and inquiring what had happened. They summoned a council to debate upon the matter, and an old dormouse, suspecting where the trouble lay, proposed that some one should be appointed to go and cut the cord. This was a bold thing to undertake, as the rays of the sun could not fail to burn whoever should venture so near to them."
the-boy-who-set-a-snare-for-the-sun,7,"At last the venerable dormouse himself undertook it, for the very good reason that no one else would. At this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world. When he stood up he looked like a mountain. It made haste to the place where the sun lay ensnared, and as it came nearer and nearer, its back began to smoke and burn with the heat. The whole top of his huge bulk was turned in a very short time to enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun, which rolled up again, as round and beautiful as ever, into the wide blue sky. But the dormouse-or blind woman as it is called-was shrunk away to a very small size. That is the reason why it is now one of the tiniest creatures upon the earth.

The little boy returned home when he discovered that the sun had escaped his snare, and devoted himself entirely to hunting. ""If the beautiful hair of my sister would not hold the sun fast, nothing in the world could,"" he said. ""He was not born, a little fellow like himself, to look after the sun. It required one greater and wiser than he was to regulate that."" And he went out and shot ten more snow-birds. In this business he was very expert, and he had a new bird-skin coat made, which was prettier than the one he had worn before."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,1,"Dectera, one of the sisters of Conchubar Mac Nessa, married a prince
whose patrimony lay along the shores of the Muirnict, and whose capital
was Dun Dalgan. They had one child, a boy, whom they named Setanta.

As soon as Setanta was able to understand the stories and conversation
of those around him, he evinced a passion for arms and the martial life,
which was so premature and violent as to surprise all who knew him. His
thoughts for ever ran on the wars and achievements of the Red Branch. He
knew all the knights by name, the appearance and bearing of each, and
what deeds of valour they had severally performed. Emain Macha, the
capital of the Clanna Rury, was never out of his mind. He saw for ever
before his mind its moats and ramparts, its gates and bridges, its
streets filled with martial men, its high-raised Duns and Raths, its
branching roads, over which came the tributes of wide Ulla to the High
King. He had seen his father's tribute driven thither, and had even
longed to be one of the four-footed beasts that he beheld wending their
way to the wondrous city. But, above all, he delighted to be told of the
great school where the young nobles of Ulster were taught martial
exercises and the military art, under the superintendence of chosen
knights and of the High King himself. Of the several knights he had his
own opinion, and had already resolved to accept no one as his instructor
save Fergus Mac Roy, tanist of Ulster."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,2,"Of his father he saw little. His mind had become impaired, and he was
confined in a secluded part of the Dun. But whenever he spoke to Dectera
of what was nearest his heart, and his desire to enter the military
school at Emain Macha, she laughed, and said that he was not yet old
enough to endure that rough life. But secretly she was alarmed, and
formed plans to detain him at home altogether. Then Setanta concealed
his desire, but enquired narrowly concerning the partings of the roads
on the way to Emania.

At last, when he was ten years old, selecting a favourable night,
Setanta stole away from his father's Dun, and before morning had crossed
the frontier. He then lay down to rest and sleep in a wood. After this
he set out again, travelling quickly, lest he should be met by any of
his father's people. On his back was strapped his little wooden shield,
and by his side hung a sword of lath. He had brought his ball and hurle
of red-bronze with him, and ran swiftly along the road, driving the ball
before him, or throwing up his javelin into the air, and running to meet
it ere it fell.

In the afternoon of that day Fergus Mac Roy and the King sat together in
the part that surrounded the King's palace. A chessboard was between
them, and their attention was fixed on the game."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,3,"At a distance the young nobles were at their sports, and the shouts of
the boys and the clash of the metal hurles resounded in the evening air.

Suddenly, the noise ceased, and Fergus and the King looked up. They saw
a strange boy rushing backwards and forwards through the crowd of young
nobles, urging the ball in any direction that he pleased, as if in
mockery, till none but the very best players attempted to stop him,
while the rest stood about the ground in groups. Fergus and the King
looked at each other for a moment in silence.

After this the boys came together into a group and held a council. Then
commenced what seemed to be an attempt to force him out of the ground,
followed by a furious fight. The strange boy seemed to be a very demon
of war; with his little hurle grasped, like a war-mace, in both hands,
he laid about him on every side, and the boys were tumbling fast. He
sprang at tall youths, like a hound at a stag's throat. He rushed
through crowds of his enemies like a hawk through a flock of birds. The
boys, seized with a panic, cried out that it was one of the Tuatha from
the fairy hills of the Boyne, and fled right and left to gain the
shelter of the trees. Some of them, pursued by the stranger, ran round
Conchubar Mac Nessa and his knight. The boy, however, running straight,
sprang over the chess table; but Conchubar seized him deftly by the
wrist and brought him to a stand, but with dilated eyes and panting."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,4,"""Why are you so enraged, my boy?"" said the King, ""and why do you so
maltreat my nobles?""

""Because they have not treated me with the respect due to a stranger,""
replied the boy.

""Who are you yourself?"" said Conchubar.

""I am Setanta, the son of Sualtim, and Dectera, your own sister, is my
mother; and it is not before my uncle's palace that I should be insulted
and dishonoured.""

This was the debut and first martial exploit of the great Cuculain, type
of Irish chivalry and courage, in the bardic firmament a bright and
particular star of strength, daring, and glory, that will not set nor
suffer aught but transient obscuration till the extinction of the Irish
race; Cuculain, bravest of the brave, whose glory affected even the
temperate-minded Tierna, so that his sober pen has inscribed, in the
annals of ancient Erin, this testimony: ""Cuculain, filius Sualtam
fortissimus heros Scotorum.""

After this Setanta was regularly received into the military school,
where, ere long, he became a favourite both with old and young. He
placed himself under the tuition of Fergus Mac Roy, who, each day, grew
more and more proud of his pupil, for while still a boy his fame was
extending over Ulla."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,5,"It was not long after this that Setanta received the name by which he is
more generally known. Culain was chief of the black country of Ulla, and
of a people altogether given up to the making of weapons and armour,
where the sound of the hammer and husky bellows were for ever heard. One
day Conchubar and some of his knights, passing through the park to
partake of an entertainment at the house of the armourer, paused awhile,
looking at the boys at play. Then, as all were praising his little
nephew, Conchubar called to him, and the boy came up, flushed and shy,
for there were with the King the chief warriors of the Red Branch. But
Conchubar bade him come with them to the feast, and the knights around
him laughed, and enumerated the good things which Culain had prepared
for them. But when Setanta's brow fell, Conchubar bade him finish his
game, and after that proceed to Culain's house, which was to the west of
Emain Macha, and more than a mile distant from the city. Then the King
and his knights went on to the feast, and Setanta returned joyfully to
his game.

Now, when they were seen afar upon the plain the smith left his workshop
and put by his implements, and having washed from him the sweat and
smoke, made himself ready to receive his guests; but the evening fell as
they were coming into the liss, and all his people came in also, and sat
at the lower table, and the bridge was drawn up and the door was shut
for the night, and the candles were lit in the high chamber."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,6,"Then said Culain, ""Have all thy retinue come in, O Conchubar?"" And when
the King said that they were all there, Culain bade one of his
apprentices go out and let loose the great mastiff that guarded the
house. Now, this mastiff was as large as a calf and exceedingly fierce,
and he guarded all the smith's property outside the house, and if anyone
approached the house without beating on the gong, which was outside the
foss and in front of the drawbridge, he was accustomed to rend him. Then
the mastiff, having been let loose, careered three times round the liss,
baying dreadfully, and after that remained quiet outside his kennel,
guarding his master's property. But, inside, they devoted themselves to
feasting and merriment, and there were many jests made concerning
Culain, for he was wont to cause laughter to Conchubar Mac Nessa and his
knights, yet he was good to his own people and faithful to the Crave
Rue, and very ardent and skilful in the practice of his art. But as they
were amusing themselves in this manner, eating and drinking, a deep
growl came from without, as it were a note of warning, and after that
one yet more savage; but where he sat in the champion's seat, Fergus Mac
Roy struck the table with his hand and rose straightway, crying out, ""It
is Setanta."" But ere the door could be opened they heard the boy's voice
raised in anger and the fierce yelling of the dog, and a scuffling in
the bawn of the liss."
the-boyhood-of-cuchulain,7,"Then they rushed to the door in great fear, for
they said that the boy was torn in pieces; but when the bolts were drawn
back and they sprang forth, eager to save the boy's life, they found the
dog dead, and Setanta standing over him with his hurle, for he had
sprung over the foss, not fearing the dog. Forthwith, then, his tutor,
Fergus Mac Roy, snatched him up on his shoulder, and returned with great
joy into the banquet hall, where all were well pleased at the
preservation of the boy, except Culain himself, who began to lament over
the death of his dog and to enumerate all the services which he rendered
to him.

""Do not grieve for thy dog, O Culain,"" said Setanta, from the shoulder
of Fergus, ""for I will perform those services for you myself until a dog
equally good is procured to take the place of him I slew.""

Then one jesting, said, ""Cu-culain!"" (Hound of Culain) and thenceforward
he went by this name."
the-bracket-bull,1,"There was a man in it long ago, and long ago it was, and if he was in it
then he would not be in it now. He was married, and his wife was lost
(i.e., died), and he had only one son by the first wife. Then he married
the second wife. This second wife had not much regard for the son, and
he was obliged to go out on the mountain, far from the house, to take
care of the cattle.

There was a bracket (speckled) bull amongst the cows out on the
mountain, and of a day that there was great hunger on the lad, the
bracket bull heard him complaining and wringing his two hands. He
moved over to him and said to him, ""You are hungry, but take the horn
off me and lay it on the ground. Put your hand into the place where the
horn was and you will find food.""

When he heard that he went over to the bull, took hold of the horn,
twisted it, and it came away with him in his hand. He laid it on the
ground, put in his hand, and drew out food and drink and a table-cloth.
He spread the table-cloth on the ground, set the food and drink on it,
and then he ate and drank his enough. When he had his enough eaten and
drunk, he put the table-cloth back again, and left the horn back in the
place where it was before."
the-bracket-bull,2,"When he came home that evening he did not eat a bit of his supper, and
his stepmother said to herself that he (must have) got something to eat
out on the mountain since he was not eating any of his supper.

When he went out with his cattle the next day his stepmother sent her
own daughter out after him, and told her to be watching him till she
should see where he was getting the food. The daughter went and put
herself in hiding, and she was watching him until the heat of the day
came. But when the middle of the day was come she heard every music more
excellent than another, and she was put to sleep by that truly melodious
music. The bull came then, and the lad twisted the horn off him and drew
out the table-cloth, the food, and the drink, and ate and drunk his
enough. He put back the horn again then. The music was stopped and the
daughter woke up, and was watching him until the evening came, and he
drove the cows home then. The mother asked her did she see anything in
the field, and she said that she did not. The lad did not eat two bites
of his supper, and there was wonder on the stepmother.

The next day when he drove out the cows the stepmother told the second
daughter to follow him, and to be watching him till she would see where
he was getting things to eat. The daughter followed him and put herself
in hiding, but when the heat of the day came the music began and she
fell asleep. The lad took the horn off the bull, drew out the
table-cloth, the food, and drink, ate and drank his enough, and put back
the horn again. The girl woke then, and was watching him until the
evening. When the evening came he drove the cows home, and he was not
able to eat his supper any more than the two evenings before. The
stepmother asked the daughter did she see anything, and she said she did
not. There was wonder on the stepmother."
the-bracket-bull,3,"The next day, when the lad went out herding the cows, the stepmother
sent the third daughter out after him, and threatened her not to fall
asleep, but to have a good watch. The daughter followed the lad, and
went into hiding. This daughter had three eyes, for she had an eye in
the back of her head. When the bracket bull began playing every music
more excellent than another, he put the other eyes to sleep, but he was
not able to put the third eye to sleep. When the heat of the day came
she saw the bracket bull coming to the boy, and the boy taking the horn
off him and eating.

She ran home then, and said to her mother that there wasn't such a
dinner in the world as was being set before the boy out of the horn of
the bracket bull.

Then the mother let on that she was sick, and she killed a cock, and she
let down its blood into her bed. She put up a sup of the blood into
her mouth, and she sent for her husband, saying that she was finding
death (dying). Her husband came in, and he saw the blood, and he said,
""Anything that is in the world that would save her that she must get
it."" She said that there wasn't a thing in the world that would save her
but a piece of the bracket bull that was on the mountain.

""You must get that,"" said he."
the-bracket-bull,4,"The bracket bull used to be the first one of the cattle that used to
come in every night, and the stepmother sent for two butchers, and she
set them on each side of the gate to kill the bracket bull when he would
come.

The bracket bull said to the boy, ""I'll be swept (done for) to-night,
unless another cow goes before me."" He put another cow out before him,
and the two butchers were standing on each side of the gate to kill the
first one that would come in. The bull sent the cow out before him,
going through the gate, and they killed her. Then the stepmother got
a piece of her to eat, and she thought that it was the bracket bull that
she was eating, and she got better then.

The next night, when the lad came home with the cattle, he ate no more
of his supper than any other night, and there was wonder on the
stepmother. She heard after this that the bracket bull was in it (i.e.,
alive) all through, and that he was not killed at that time.

When she heard that she killed a cock, and she let down some of its
blood into her bed. She put a sup of the blood into her mouth, and
she played the same trick over again, and said that there was nothing
at all to cure her but a piece of the bracket bull."
the-bracket-bull,5,"The butchers were sent for, and they were ready to kill the bracket bull
as soon as he came in. The bracket bull sent another one of the cattle
in before himself, and the butchers killed it. The woman got part of its
flesh, and she thought it was part of the bracket bull she was eating,
and she got better.

She found out afterwards that it was not the bracket bull that was dead,
and she said, ""Never mind; I'll kill the bracket bull yet!""

The next day, when the lad was herding the cows on the mountain, the
bracket bull came and said to him, ""Take the horn off me and eat your
enough now. That's the last time for you. They are waiting to kill me
to-night, but don't you be afraid. It is not they who shall kill me, but
another bull shall kill me. Get up on my back now.""

The lad got up on his back then and they went home. The two butchers
were on each side of the gate waiting for him. The bracket bull struck a
horn on each side of him, and he killed the two butchers. Out with him
then, and the lad on his back.

He went into a wild wood, and he himself and the lad spent the night in
that wood. He was to fight with the other bull on the next day."
the-bracket-bull,6,"When the day came, the bracket bull said, ""Take the horn off me and eat
your enough--that's the last luck you have. I am to fight with the other
bull immediately, and I shall escape from him to-day, but he will have
me dead to-morrow by twelve o'clock.""

Himself and the other bull fought that day, and the bracket bull came
back in the evening, and he himself and the lad passed that night in the
wood.

When the next day came, the bracket bull said to him, ""Twist the horn
off me and eat your enough--that's the last luck you'll have. Listen now
to the thing that I'm telling you. When you'll see me dead, go and cut a
strip of skin of the back and a strip of the stomach off me, and make a
belt of it, and at any time at all there will be any hard pinch on you,
you shall have my power.""

The bracket bull went then to fight with the other bull, and the other
bull killed him. The other bull went away then. The lad came to the
bracket bull where he was lying on the ground, and he was not dead,
out-and-out. When he saw the boy coming he said, ""Oh,"" said he, ""make
haste as well as you can in the world, and take out your knife and cut
that strip off me, or you will be killed as well as myself."""
the-bracket-bull,7,"There was a trembling in the poor creature's hand, and he was not able
to cut a piece at all off the bull, after his feeding him for so long,
and after the kindness he had got from him.

The bracket bull spoke again, and told him to cut the strip off him on
the instant, and that it would assist him as long as he would be alive.
He cut a strip off the back then, and another strip off the belly, and
he went away.

There was plenty of trouble and of grief on him, going of him, and he
ought to have that on him too, and he departing without any knowledge of
where he was making for, or where he would go.

A gentleman met him on the road, and asked him where he was going. The
lad said that he did not himself know where he was going, but that he
was going looking for work.

""What are you able to do?"" says the gentleman.

""I'm as good a herd as ever you saw, but I'll not tell you a lie--I can
do nothing but herding; but, indeed, I'll do that as well as any man
that ever you saw.""

""It's you I want,"" says the gentleman. ""There are three giants up by my
land, on the one mearing with me, and anything that will go in on their
land they will keep it, and I cannot take it off them again. That's all
they're asking--my cattle to go in across the mearing to them.""

""Never mind them. I'll go bail that I'll take good heed of them, and
that I'll not let anything in to them."""
the-bracket-bull,8,"The gentleman brought him home then, and he went herding for him. When
the grass was getting scarce, he was driving the cows further out. There
was a big stone wall between the land of the giants and his master's
land. There was fine grass on the other side of the wall. When he saw
that, he threw down a gap in the wall and let in the pigs and the cows.
He went up into a tree then, and was throwing down apples and all sorts
(of fruit) to the pigs.

A giant came out, and when he saw the lad up on the tree throwing down
the apples to the pigs, the head rose on him (i.e., he got furious). He
came to the tree. ""Get down out of that,"" says he. ""I think you big for
one bite and small for two bites; come down till I draw you under my
long cold teeth.""

""Arrah, take yourself easy,"" says the boy; ""perhaps it's too quick I'd
come down to you.""

""I won't be talking to you any longer,"" says the giant. He got a
leverage on the tree and drew it up out of the roots.

""Go down, black thong, and squeeze that fellow,"" says the lad, for he
remembered the advice of the bracket bull. On the instant the black
thong leaped out of his hand, and squeezed the giant so hard that the
two eyes were going out on his head, for stronger was the power of the
bull than the power of the giant. The giant was not able to put a stir
out of himself, and he promised anything at all--only to save his life
for him. ""Anything at all you want,"" says he to the lad, ""you must get
it from me."""
the-bracket-bull,9,"""I'm not asking anything at all except the loan of the sword that's
under your bed,"" says he.

""I give it to you, and welcome,"" says the giant. He went in, and brought
out the sword with him.

""Try it on the three biggest trees that are in the wood, and you won't
feel it in your hand going through them,"" says the giant.

""I don't see any tree in the wood bigger or uglier than yourself,"" says
he, drawing the sword and whipping the head off him, so that he sent it
seven furrows and seven ridges with that stroke.

""If I were to get on the body again,"" said the head, and it talking,
""and the men of the world wouldn't get me off the trunk again.""

""I'll take good care myself of that,"" says the lad.

When he drove the cows home in the evening, they had that much milk that
they had not half enough of vessels, and two coopers were obliged to
make new vessels to hold the quantity of milk they had.

""You're the best lad that ever I met,"" says the gentleman, and he was
thankful to him."
the-bracket-bull,10,"The giants used to put--each man of them--a shout of him every evening.
The people only heard two shouts that evening. ""There's some change in
the caher[2] to-night,"" said the gentleman, when he heard the two
shouts.

""Oh,"" says the lad, ""I saw one of them going away by himself to-day, and
he did not come home yet.""

On the next day the lad drove out his cattle until he came to the big
stone wall, and he threw a gap in it, and let the cattle into the same
place. He went up into a tree and began throwing down the apples. The
second giant came running, and said, ""What's the meaning of throwing my
wall and letting in your cattle on my estate? Get down out of that at
once. You killed my brother yesterday.""

""Go down, black thong, and bind that one,"" says the lad. The thong
squeezed him so that he was not able to put a stir out of himself, and
he promised the lad anything at all--only to spare his life.

""I am asking nothing of you but the loan of the old sword that is under
your bed.""

""I'll give you that, and welcome."" He went in, and brought out the sword
with him. Each man of them had a sword, and every sword better than
another.

""Try that sword on the six biggest trees that are in the wood, and it
will go through them without turning the edge."""
the-bracket-bull,11,"""I don't see any tree in the wood bigger or uglier than yourself,"" says
he, drawing the sword and whipping the head off him, so that he sent it
seven furrows and seven ridges from the body.

""Oh,"" said the head, ""if I were to get going on the body again, and the
men of the world wouldn't get me off it again.""

""Oh, I'll take care of that myself,"" says the boy.

When he drove the cows home that night there was wonder on the people
when they saw the quantity of milk they had. The gentleman said that
there was another change in the caher that day again, as he did not hear
but only one shout, but the lad said that he saw another one going away
that day, and that it was likely that he did not come back yet.

On the next day he went out, and drove the pigs and the cows up to the
hall door, and was throwing down the apples to them. The third giant
came out--the eldest man of them--and he was full mad after his two
brothers being dead, and the teeth that were in his head were making a
hand-stick for him. He told the boy to come down; that he did not know
what he would do to him after his having killed his two brothers. ""Come
down,"" says he, ""till I draw you under my long, cold teeth""; and it was
on him the long, cold teeth were, and no lie.

""Go down, black thong, and bind that one till the eyes will be going out
on his head with the power of the squeezing that you'll give him."""
the-bracket-bull,12,"The black thong leaped from him, and it bound the giant until the two
eyes were going out on his head with the squeezing and with the
tightening it gave him, and the giant promised to give him anything at
all; ""but spare my life,"" says he.

""I'm only asking the loan of the old sword that's under your bed,"" said
the lad.

""Have it, and welcome,"" says the giant. He went in, and brought out the
sword with him. ""Now,"" says the giant, ""strike the two ugliest stumps in
the wood, and the sword will cut them without getting a bent edge.""

""Musha, then, by Mary,"" says the boy, ""I don't see any stump in the wood
uglier than yourself,"" and he struck him so that he sent his head seven
furrows and seven ridges from the body.

""Ochone for ever!"" says the head. ""If I were to get going on the body
again, the men of the world--they wouldn't get me off the body again.""

""I'll take care of that myself,"" says the boy.

When he came home that night the coopers were not able to make enough of
vessels for them to hold the quantity of milk that the cows had, and the
pigs were not able to eat with the quantity of apples that they had
eaten before that.

He was a while in that way herding the cows and everything that was in
the castle, he had it. There was no one at all going near the castle,
for there was fear on them."
the-bracket-bull,13,"There was a fiery dragon in that country, and he used to come every
seven years, and unless there would be a young woman ready bound before
him he would drive the sea through the land, and he would destroy the
people. The day came when the dragon was to come, and the lad asked his
master to let him go to the place where the dragon was coming. ""What's
the business you have there?"" says the master. ""There will be horsemen
and coaches and great people there, and the crowds will be gathered
together in it out of every place. The horses would rise up on top of
you, and you would be crushed under their feet; and it's better for you
to stop at home.""

""I'll stop,"" said the lad. But when he got them all gone he went to the
castle of the three giants, and he put a saddle on the best steed they
had, and a fine suit on himself, and he took the first giant's sword in
his hand, and he went to where the dragon was.

It was like a fair there, with the number of riders and coaches and
horses and people that were gathered in it. There was a young lady bound
to a post on the brink of the sea, and she waiting for the dragon to
come to swallow her. It was the King's daughter that was in it, for the
dragon would not take any other woman. When the dragon came out of the
sea the lad went against him, and they fought with one another, and were
fighting till the evening, until the dragon was frothing at the mouth,
and till the sea was red with its blood."
the-bracket-bull,14,"He turned the dragon out into
the sea at last. He went away then, and said that he would return the
next day. He left the steed again in the place where he found it, and he
took the fine suit off him, and when the other people returned he was
before them. When the people came home that night they were all talking
and saying that some champion came to fight with the dragon and turned
him out into the sea again. That was the story that every person had,
but they did not know who was the champion who did it.

The next day, when his master and the other people were gone, he went to
the castle of the three giants again, and he took out another steed and
another suit of valour (i.e., armour), and he brought with him the
second giant's sword, and he went to the place where the dragon was to
come.

The King's daughter was bound to a post on the shore, waiting for him,
and the eyes going out on her head looking would she see the champion
coming who fought the dragon the day before. There were twice as many
people in it as there were on the first day, and they were all waiting
till they would see the champion coming. When the dragon came the lad
went in face of him, and the dragon was half confused and sickened after
the fight that he had made the day before. They were beating one another
till the evening, and then he drove away the dragon. The people tried to
keep him, but they were not able. He went from them."
the-bracket-bull,15,"When his master came home that evening the lad was in the house before
him. The master told him that another champion came that day, and that
he had turned the dragon into the sea. But no doubt the lad knew the
story better himself than he did.

On the next day, when the gentleman was gone, he went to the caher of
the giants, and he took with him another steed and another suit and the
sword of the third giant, and when he came to fight with the dragon the
people thought it was another champion who was in it.

He himself and the dragon were beating each other, then, and the sorra
such a fight you ever saw. There were wings on the dragon, and when he
was getting it tight he rose up in the air, and he was thrusting and
beating the boy in his skull till he was nearly destroyed. He remembered
the black thong then, and said, ""Black thong, bind that one so hard that
they'll be listening to his screeching in the two divisions of the world
with the squeezing that you'll give him."" The black thong leapt away,
and she bound him, and then the lad took the head off him, and the sea
was red with his blood, and the waves of blood were going on the top of
the water.

The lad came to the land, then, and they tried to keep him; but he went
from them, and as he was riding by the lady snatched the shoe off him."
the-bracket-bull,16,"He went away, then, and he left the horse and the sword and the suit of
armour in the place where he found them, and when the gentleman and the
other people came home he was sitting before them at the fire. He asked
them how the fight went, and they told him that the champion killed the
fiery dragon, but that he was gone away, and that no one at all knew who
he was.

When the King's daughter came home she said that she would never marry a
man but the man whom that shoe would fit.

There were sons of kings, and great people among them, and they saying
that it was themselves who killed the dragon; but she said it was not
they, unless the shoe would fit them. Some of them were cutting the toes
off their feet, and some of them taking off a piece of the heel, and
more of them cutting the big toe off themselves, trying would the shoe
fit them. There was no good for them in it. The King's daughter said
that she would not marry one man of them.

She sent out soldiers, then, and the shoe with them, to try would it fit
anyone at all. Every person, poor and rich, no matter where he was from,
must try the shoe on him.

The lad was stretched out lying on the grass when the soldiers came, and
when they saw him they said to him, ""Show your foot.""

""Oh, don't be humbugging me,"" says he."
the-bracket-bull,17,"""We have orders,"" said they, ""and we cannot return without trying the
shoe on everyone, poor and rich, so stretch out your foot."" He did that,
and the shoe went in on his foot on the moment.

They said to him that he must come with them.

""Oh, listen to me"" (i.e., give me time), said he, ""till I dress myself.""

He went to the caher of the giants, and he got a fine new suit on him,
and he went with them then.

That's where the welcome was for him, and he as dressed up as e'er a
man of them. They had a wedding for three days and three nights.

They got the pond and I the lakelet. They were drowned, and I came
through. And as I have it (i.e., the story) to-night, that ye may not
have it to-morrow night, or if ye have it itself, that ye may only lose
the back teeth by it!"
the-brown-bear-of-norway,1,"There was once a king in Ireland, and he had three daughters, and very
nice princesses they were. And one day, when they and their father were
walking on the lawn, the king began to joke with them, and to ask them
whom they would like to be married to. 'I'll have the king of Ulster for
a husband,' says one; 'and I'll have the king of Munster,' says another;
'and,' says the youngest, 'I'll have no husband but the Brown Bear of
Norway.' For a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted
prince that she called by that name, and she fell in love with him, and
his name was the first name on her tongue, for the very night before she
was dreaming of him. Well, one laughed, and another laughed, and they
joked with the princess all the rest of the evening."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,2,"But that very night she woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with
a thousand lamps; the richest carpets were on the floor, and the walls
were covered with cloth of gold and silver, and the place was full of
grand company, and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was
there, and it wasn't a moment till he was on one knee before her, and
telling her how much he loved her, and asking her wouldn't she be his
queen. Well, she hadn't the heart to refuse him, and married they were
the same evening.

'Now, my darling,' says he, when they were left by themselves, 'you
must know that I am under enchantment. A sorceress, that had a beautiful
daughter, wished me for her son-in-law; but the mother got power over
me, and when I refused to wed her daughter she made me take the form of
a bear by day, and I was to continue so till a lady would marry me of
her own free will, and endure five years of great trials after.'"
the-brown-bear-of-norway,3,"Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from
her side, and spent the day very sadly. But as soon as the lamps were
lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with
silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the
next minute. So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that
whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him,
they would be parted for ever, and he'd be obliged to marry the witch's
daughter.

She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy
twelvemonth together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and
happy as she was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her
child to keep her company in the day when she couldn't see her husband.

At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were
sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an
eagle, took the infant's sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with
him. She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after
him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously. She
bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the
cries and complaints that were on her tongue. She spent her days very
lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to
her. Then she thought to herself she'd have a sharp eye about her this
time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches
open."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,4,"But all her care was in vain. Another evening, when they were all so
happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood
before them, took the child out of the father's hand, and was out of
the door before you could wink. This time she shouted and ran out of
the room, but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all
declared that neither child nor dog passed out. She felt, somehow, as if
it was her husband's fault, but still she kept command over herself, and
didn't once reproach him.

When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door
to be left open for a moment; but she wasn't the nearer to keep the
child to herself. They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a
lady appeared standing by them. The princess opened her eyes in a great
fright and stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped
a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father's lap, and either
sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney.
This time the mother kept her bed for a month."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,5,"'My dear,' said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover,
'I think I'd feel better if I was to see my father and mother and
sisters once more. If you give me leave to go home for a few days I'd
be glad.' 'Very well,' said he, 'I will do that, and whenever you feel
inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night.'
The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber
in her father's palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had
her mother and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed
till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,6,"In time she told them all that had happened to her, and they didn't know
what to advise her to do. She was as fond of her husband as ever, and
said she was sure that he couldn't help letting the children go; but
still she was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from
her. Well, the mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to
bring eggs to the castle, for they had great faith in her wisdom. She
said the only plan was to secure the bear's skin that the prince was
obliged to put on every morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn't
help being a man night and day, and the enchantment would be at an end.

So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and
after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again
that she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours
after, she was in her husband's palace, and he himself was watching over
her. There was great joy on both sides, and they were happy for many
days."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,7,"Now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in
the morning, and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet
drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.

One night she contrived not to drink any of it, though she pretended to
do so; and she was wakeful enough in the morning, and saw her husband
passing out through a panel in the wainscot, though she kept her eyelids
nearly closed. The next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset
that she saved the evening before put into her husband's night drink,
and that made him sleep sound enough. She got up after midnight, passed
through the panel, and found a Beautiful brown bear's hide hanging in
the corner. Then she stole back, and went down to the parlour fire, and
put the hide into the middle of it till it was all fine ashes. She then
lay down by her husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and fell asleep.

If she was to live a hundred years she'd never forget how she wakened
next morning, and found her husband looking down on her with misery and
anger in his face. 'Unhappy woman,' said he, 'you have separated us for
ever! Why hadn't you patience for five years? I am now obliged, whether
I like or no, to go a three days' journey to the witch's castle, and
marry her daughter. The skin that was my guard you have burned it, and
the egg-wife that gave you the counsel was the witch herself. I won't
reproach you: your punishment will be severe without it. Farewell for
ever!'"
the-brown-bear-of-norway,8,"He kissed her for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking
as fast as he could. She shouted after him, and then seeing there was no
use, she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed,
nor looked back, and still she kept him in sight; and when he was on the
hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on
the hill. Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was
setting, he turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled
up after him, and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy
on his knees, and he kissing and hugging him."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,9,"'Here, my poor darling,'says he, 'is your eldest child, and there,' says he, pointing to a woman
that was looking on with a smile on her face, 'is the eagle that carried
him away.' She forgot all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child,
and laughing and crying over him. The woman washed their feet, and
rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their
bones, and made them as fresh as a daisy. Next morning, just before
sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be off, 'Here,' said he to her, 'is
a thing which may be of use to you. It's a scissors, and whatever stuff
you cut with it will be turned into silk. The moment the sun rises, I'll
lose all memory of yourself and the children, but I'll get it at sunset
again. Farewell!' But he wasn't far gone till she was in sight of him
again, leaving her boy behind. It was the same to-day as yesterday:
their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the
evening. He never stopped, and she never stopped, and as the sun was
setting he turned up another lane, and there they found their little
daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till morning, and then the
third day's journey commenced."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,10,"But before he started he gave her a comb, and told her that whenever she
used it, pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair. Still he had his
memory from sunset to sunrise; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled
on under the charm, and never threw his eye behind. This night they
came to where the youngest baby was, and the next morning, just before
sunrise, the prince spoke to her for the last time. 'Here, my poor
wife,' said he, 'is a little hand-reel, with gold thread that has no
end, and the half of our marriage ring. If you ever get to my house,
and put your half-ring to mine, I shall recollect you. There is a wood
yonder, and the moment I enter it I shall forget everything that ever
happened between us, just as if I was born yesterday. Farewell, dear
wife and child, for ever!' Just then the sun rose, and away he walked
towards the wood. She saw it open before him and close after him, and
when she came up, she could no more get in than she could break
through a stone wall. She wrung her hands and shed tears, but then she
recollected herself, and cried out, 'Wood, I charge you by my three
magic gifts, the scissors, the comb, and the reel--to let me through';
and it opened, and she went along a walk till she came in sight of a
palace, and a lawn, and a woodman's cottage on the edge of the wood
where it came nearest the palace."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,11,"She went into the lodge, and asked the woodman and his wife to take her
into their service. They were not willing at first; but she told them
she would ask no wages, and would give them diamonds, and pearls, and
silk stuffs, and gold thread whenever they wished for them, and then
they agreed to let her stay.

It wasn't long till she heard how a young prince, that was just arrived,
was living in the palace of the young mistress. He seldom stirred
abroad, and every one that saw him remarked how silent and sorrowful he
went about, like a person that was searching for some lost thing."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,12,"The servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice
of the beautiful young woman at the lodge, and to annoy her with their
impudence. The head footman was the most troublesome, and at last she
invited him to come and take tea with her. Oh, how rejoiced he was, and
how he bragged of it in the servants' hall! Well, the evening came, and
the footman walked into the lodge, and was shown to her sitting-room;
for the lodge-keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her, and gave
her two nice rooms for herself. Well, he sat down as stiff as a ramrod,
and was talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle,
while she was getting the tea and toast ready. 'Oh,' says she to him,
'would you put your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two
of honeysuckle?' He got up in great glee, and put out his hand and head;
and said she, 'By the virtue of my magic gifts, let a pair of horns
spring out of your head, and sing to the lodge.' Just as she wished, so
it was. They sprung from the front of each ear, and met at the back. Oh,
the poor wretch! And how he bawled and roared! and the servants that he
used to be boasting to were soon flocking from the castle, and grinning,
and huzzaing, and beating tunes on tongs and shovels and pans; and he
cursing and swearing, and the eyes ready to start out of his head, and
he so black in the face, and kicking out his legs behind him like mad."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,13,"At last she pitied him, and removed the charm, and the horns dropped
down on the ground, and he would have killed her on the spot, only he
was as weak as water, and his fellow-servants came in and carried him up
to the big house. Well, some way or other the story came to the ears of
the prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a
countrywoman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not
hide her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled after he had a good look,
just as a body is puzzled to know whether something happened to him when
he was young or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch's daughter heard
about it too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she
find her doing but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper;
and as she cut away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The
witch's daughter looked on with greedy eyes, and, says she, 'What would
you be satisfied to take for that scissors?' 'I'll take nothing,' says
she, 'but leave to spend one night outside the prince's chamber.' Well,
the proud lady fired up, and was going to say something dreadful; but
the scissors kept on cutting, and the silk growing richer and richer
every inch. So she promised what the girl had asked her."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,14,"When night came on she was let into the palace and lay down till the
prince was in such a dead sleep that all she did couldn't awake him.
She sung this verse to him, sighing and sobbing, and kept singing it the
night long, and it was all in vain:

Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.

At the first dawn the proud lady was in the chamber, and led her away,
and the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was
quitting the palace.

So there was no luck so far; but the next day the prince passed by again
and looked at her, and saluted her kindly, as a prince might a farmer's
daughter, and passed one; and soon the witch's daughter passed by, and
found her combing her hair, and pearls and diamonds dropping from it.

Well, another bargain was made, and the princess spent another night of
sorrow, and she left the castle at daybreak, and the footman was at his
post and enjoyed his revenge."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,15,"The third day the prince went by, and stopped to talk with the strange
woman. He asked her could he do anything to serve her, and she said he
might. She asked him did he ever wake at night. He said that he often
did, but that during the last two nights he was listening to a sweet
song in his dreams, and could not wake, and that the voice was one that
he must have known and loved in some other world long ago. Says she,
'Did you drink any sleepy posset either of these evenings before you
went to bed?' 'I did,' said he. 'The two evenings my wife gave me
something to drink, but I don't know whether it was a sleepy posset or
not.' 'Well, prince,' said she, 'as you say you would wish to oblige me,
you can do it by not tasting any drink to-night.' 'I will not,' says he,
and then he went on his walk.

Well, the great lady came soon after the prince, and found the stranger
using her hand-reel and winding threads of gold off it, and the third
bargain was made.

That evening the prince was lying on his bed at twilight, and his mind
much disturbed; and the door opened, and in his princess walked, and
down she sat by his bedside and sung:

Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me."
the-brown-bear-of-norway,16,"'Brown Bear of Norway!' said he. 'I don't understand you.' 'Don't you
remember, prince, that I was your wedded wife for four years?' 'I do
not,' said he, 'but I'm sure I wish it was so.' 'Don't you remember our
three babes that are still alive?' 'Show me them. My mind is all a heap
of confusion.' 'Look for the half of our marriage ring, that hangs at
your neck, and fit it to this.' He did so, and the same moment the charm
was broken. His full memory came back on him, and he flung his arms
round his wife's neck, and both burst into tears.

Well, there was a great cry outside, and the castle walls were heard
splitting and cracking. Everyone in the castle was alarmed, and made
their way out. The prince and princess went with the rest, and by the
time all were safe on the lawn, down came the building, and made the
ground tremble for miles round. No one ever saw the witch and her
daughter afterwards. It was not long till the prince and princess had
their children with them, and then they set out for their own palace.
The kings of Ireland and of Munster and Ulster, and their wives, soon
came to visit them, and may every one that deserves it be as happy as
the Brown Bear of Norway and his family."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,1,"Once upon a time there lived in France a man whose name was Jalm Riou.
You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more
contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a
daughter called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed
girl in the whole country side. When she appeared on holidays in her
embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the
other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with
envy, but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back
as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and
that she had more partners than any other girl."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,2,"Now amongst all the young men who wanted to marry Barbaik, the one whose
heart was most set on her was her father's head man, but as his manners
were rough and he was exceedingly ugly she would have nothing to say to
him, and, what was worse, often made fun of him with the rest."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,3,"Jegu, for that was his name, of course heard of this, and it made him
very unhappy. Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work
elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at
all, and what was life worth to him without that?"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,4,"One evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields, and stopped
at a little lake on the way home to let them drink. He was tired with
a long day's work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the
animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of
Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,5,"'What is the matter, Jegu? You mustn't despair yet.'

The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there.

'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice.

'But where are you?' inquired Jegu.'Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little
green frog. I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and
even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.'

'Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally
appear,' replied Jegu.

'Certainly, if you wish,' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the
horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,6,"This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him
have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that
Jegu might find him of some use.

'But why should you take all this interest in me?' asked the peasant
suspiciously.

'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never
forgotten,' answered the little fellow. 'You know, I am sure, that
the korigans who dwell in the White Corn
country have declared war on my people, because they say that they are
the friends of man. We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant
lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes.
Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we
have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got
to know you.'"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,7,"'How?' exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment.

'Do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river,
three months ago, you found a robin redbreast caught in a net?'

'Yes,' answered Jegu, 'I remember it very well, and I opened the net and
let him go.'

'Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be
your friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of
what I say by helping you to do so.'

'Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't
give you, except my soul.'

'Then let me alone,' rejoined the dwarf, 'and I promise you that in a
very few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik.'

'But how are you going to do it?' exclaimed Jegu wonderingly.

'That is my affair. Perhaps I may tell you later. Meanwhile you just eat
and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything.'"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,8,"Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then taking off his hat,
he thanked the dwarf heartily, and led his horses back to the farm.

Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as
she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to
start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. She went
first to the cow-house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her
amazement she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the
cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,9,"'Of course, Jegu must have done this in the hope of my giving him a
dance,' she thought to herself, and when she met him outside the door
she stopped and thanked him for his help. To be sure, Jegu only replied
roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer
made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.

The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow-house been so
clean nor the cows so fat. Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen
pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented
with leaves. At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of
affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,10,"Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming
downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture
polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to
do except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the
fields to come and eat it. This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu,
and she could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very
useful to a girl who liked to lie in bed and to amuse herself."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,11,"Indeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied. If
the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest
her complexion should be spoilt, she need only to run down to the spring
close by and say softly, 'I should like my churns to be full, and my
wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry,' and she need never give
another thought to the matter."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,12,"If she found the rye bread too hard to bake, or the oven taking too long
to heat, she just murmured, 'I should like to see my six loaves on the
shelf above the bread box,' and two hours after there they were.

If she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road,
she would say out loud the night before, 'Why am I not already back from
Morlaix with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of
wild cherries on my wooden plate, and the money I have gained in my
apron pocket?' and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold! there
were standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter
bowl inside, the black cherries on the wooden plate, and six new pieces
of silver in the pocket of her apron. And she believed that all this
was owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her
thoughts."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,13,"When things had reached this pass, the brownie told the young man that
he had better ask Barbaik to marry him, and this time the girl did not
turn rudely away, but listened patiently to the end. In her eyes he was
as ugly and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful
husband, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just
like a young lady, and as for the rest of the day, it would not be
half long enough for all she meant to do. She would wear the beautiful
dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours,
who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance
as much as she wished. Jegu would always be there to work for her and
save for her, and watch over her. So, like a well-brought-up girl,
Barbaik answered that it should be as her father pleased, knowing quite
well that old Riou had often said that after he was dead there was no
one so capable of carrying on the farm."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,14,"The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the
old man died quite suddenly. Now Jegu had everything to see to himself,
and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive. But
once more the brownie stepped in, and was better than ten labourers.
It was he who ploughed and sowed and reaped, and if, as happened,
occasionally, it was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie
called in some of his friends, and as soon as it was light a host of
little dwarfs might have been seen in the fields, busy with hoe, fork or
sickle. But by the time the people were about all was finished, and the
little fellows had disappeared."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,15,"And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth. From
the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage
that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the
weeks and months before. She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he
only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about. But
the brownie, who was standing by, burst out laughing, and confessed that
all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him, for the
sake of Jegu, but that now he had other business to do, and it was high
time that she looked after her house herself."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,16,"Barbaik was furious. Each morning when she was obliged to get up before
dawn to milk the cows and go to market, and each evening when she had to
sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled
with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of
ease and pleasure. But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face,
squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,17,"'If it had not been for you, you miserable dwarf!' she would say between
her teeth, 'if it had not been for you I should never have married that
man, and I should still have been going to dances, where the young men
would have brought me present of nuts and cherries, and told me that
I was the prettiest girl in the parish. While now I can receive no
presents except from my husband. I can never dance, except with my
husband. Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!'"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,18,"In spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than Barbaik how to
put her pride in her pocket when it suited her, and after receiving an
invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to
ride there. To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the
city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. Full of
excitement, Barbaik started on her journey. It was not long, and when
she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding
counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, 'Listen, my friends! I
have come to beg you to lend me a black horse, with eyes, a mouth, ears,
bridle and saddle.'"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,19,"She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back
she started for the village where the wedding was to be held.

At first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work
which she hated, that she noticed nothing, but very soon it struck
her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all
laughed as they looked at her horse. At length she caught some words
uttered by one man to another. 'Why, the farmer's wife has sold her
horse's tail!' and turned in her saddle. Yes; it was true. Her horse
had no tail! She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had
carried out her orders to the letter!"
the-brownie-of-the-lake,20,"'Well, at any rate, I shall soon be there,' she thought, and shaking
the reins, tried to urge the horse to a gallop. But it was of no use; he
declined to move out of a walk; and she was forced to hear all the jokes
that were made upon her.

In the evening she returned to the farm more angry than ever, and
quite determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the
chance, which happened to be very soon."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,21,"It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their
fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to
have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance
there. Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything
for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table-cloths
in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes,
and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. He
expected she would refuse, as he knew she hated the dwarfs, but she said
nothing, and prepared the supper as he had bidden her."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,22,"When all was ready, the dwarfs, in new green suits, came bustling in,
very happy and merry, and took their seats at the table. But in a moment
they all sprang up with a cry, and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had
placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little
toes were burnt.'You won't forget that in a hurry,' she said, smiling grimly to herself,
but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which
they poured on the fire. Then they joined hands and danced round it,
singing:

          Wicked traitress, Barne Riou,
          Our poor toes are burned by you;
          Now we hurry from your hall--
          Bad luck light upon you all."
the-brownie-of-the-lake,23,"That evening they left the country for ever, and Jegu, without their
help, grew poorer and poorer, and at last died of misery, while Barbaik
was glad to find work in the market of Morlaix."
the-bunyip,1,"Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young
men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and
children. The sun was hot, but they liked heat, and as they went they
ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was
cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always
returns to the thrower. They did not get on very fast at this rate, but
presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of
water, but was now, in the height of summer, only a set of pools, each
surrounded with a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the
inside of all."
the-bunyip,2,"In that country the people are fond of the roots of
bulrushes, which they think as good as onions, and one of the young men
said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back
to the camp. It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows
into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull
up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out: 'After all, why
should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and
children? Let them come and get the roots for themselves; but we will
fish for eels and anything else we can get.'"
the-bunyip,3,"This delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange
their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to
search for bait for their hooks. Most of them used worms, but one, who
had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a
little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions."
the-bunyip,4,"For a long time they cast patiently, without receiving a single bite;
the sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to
go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show; when
the youth, who had baited his hook with raw meat, suddenly saw his line
disappear under the water. Something, a very heavy fish he supposed,
was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet, and for a few
minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the
pool. He cried to his friends to help him, and at last, trembling with
fright at what they were going to see, they managed between them to land
on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something
of both, with a long, broad tail. They looked at each other with horror,
cold shivers running down their spines; for though they had never beheld
it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was--the
cub of the awful Bunyip!"
the-bunyip,5,"All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by
another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her
den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes.
'Let it go! let it go!' whispered the young men to each other; but the
captor declared that he had caught it, and was going to keep it. 'He had
promised his sweetheart,' he said, 'that he would bring back enough meat
for her father's house to feast on for three days, and though they could
not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to
play with.' So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he
threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders, and set out for the camp,
never heeding the poor mother's cries of distress."
the-bunyip,6,"By this time it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow,
though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright. The youths had
all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound
behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising,
and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered. 'What
could it be?' they asked one of another; 'there was not a cloud in the
sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it
do before.'"
the-bunyip,7,"For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen,
then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip
running faster than all. When he reached a high peak over-looking all
the plain he stopped to take breath, and turned to see if he was safe
yet. Safe! why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of
water, and these were fast disappearing. They must run fast indeed if
they were to escape. So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as
they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes
scooped out of the earth where they had all been born. The old men were
sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering
together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was
scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible
was upon them."
the-bunyip,8,"'The water! the water!' gasped one of the young men; and
there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself. Parents and
children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back
the advancing flood; and the youth who had caused all this terrible
catastrophe, seized his sweetheart, and cried: 'I will climb with you
to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us.'"
the-bunyip,9,"But, as he
spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his
feet. Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer, but
bird's claws. He looked at the girl he was clasping, and beheld a great
black bird standing at his side; he turned to his friends, but a flock
of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his
hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of
wings; and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard
before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow
and slender. Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found
himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the
image of a black swan, one of many."
the-bunyip,10,"Never again did the swans become men; but they are still different from
other swans, for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk
in a language that is certainly not swan's language; and there are even
sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom
we know."
the-bunyip,11,"The little Bunyip was carried home by its mother, and after that the
waters sank back to their own channels. The side of the pool where
she lives is always shunned by everyone, as nobody knows when she may
suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws. But people
say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled
with beautiful things, such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no
idea of. Though how they know I cannot tell you, as nobody has ever seen
it."
the-coming-of-finn,1,"It was the Eve of Samhain, which we Christians call All Hallows' Eve.

The King of Ireland, Conn, the Hundred-Fighter, sat at supper in his
palace at Tara. All his chiefs and mighty men were with him. On his
right hand was his only son, Art the Solitary, so called because he had
no brothers. The sons of Morna, who kept the boy Finn out of his rights
and were at the time trying to kill him if they could, were here too.
Chief amongst them was Gaul mac Morna, a huge and strong warrior, and
Captain of all the Fians ever since that battle in which Finn's father
had been killed.

And Gaul's men were with him. The great long table was spread for
supper. A thousand wax candles shed their light through the chamber, and
caused the vessels of gold, silver, and bronze to shine. Yet, though it
was a great feast, none of these warriors seemed to care about eating or
drinking; every face was sad, and there was little conversation, and no
music. It seemed as if they were expecting some calamity. Conn's
sceptre, which was a plain staff of silver, lay beside him on the table,
and there was a canopy of bright bronze over his head. Gaul mac Morna,
Captain of the Fians, sat at the other end of the long table. Every
warrior wore a bright banqueting mantle of silk or satin, scarlet or
crimson, blue, green, or purple, fastened on the breast either with a
great brooch or with a pin of gold or silver. Yet, though their raiment
was bright and gay, and though all the usual instruments of festivity
were there, and a thousand tall candles shed their light over the scene,
no one looked happy."
the-coming-of-finn,2,"Then was heard a low sound like thunder, and the earth seemed to
tremble, and after that they distinctly heard a footfall like the slow,
deliberate tread of a giant. These footfalls sent a chill into every
heart, and every face, gloomy before, was now pale.

The King leaned past his son Art the Solitary, and said to a certain
Druid who sat beside Art, ""Is this the son of Midna come before his
time?"" ""It is not,"" said the Druid, ""but it is the man who is to conquer
Midna. One is coming to Tara this night before whose glory all other
glory shall wax dim.""

Shortly after that they heard the voices of the doorkeepers raised in
contention, as if they would repel from the hall someone who wished to
enter, then a slight scuffle, and after that a strange figure entered
the chamber. He was dressed in the skins of wild beasts, and wore over
his shoulders a huge thick cloak of wild boars' skins, fastened on the
breast with a white tusk of the same animal. He wore a shield and two
spears. Though of huge stature his face was that of a boy, smooth on the
cheeks and lips. It was white and ruddy, and very handsome. His hair was
like refined gold. A light seemed to go out from him, before which the
candles burned dim. It was Finn.

He stood in the doorway, and cried out in a strong and sonorous, but
musical, voice:"
the-coming-of-finn,3,"""O Conn the Hundred-Fighter, son of Felimy, the righteous son of Tuthal
the legitimate, O King of the Kings of Erin, a wronged and disinherited
youth, possessing nowhere one rood of his patrimony, a wanderer and an
outlaw, a hunter of the wildernesses and mountains, claims hospitality
of thee, illustrious prince, on the eve of the great festival of
Samhain.""

""Thou art welcome whoever thou art,"" answered the King, ""and doubly
welcome because thou art unfortunate. I think, such is thy face and
form, that thou art the son of some mighty king on whom disaster has
fallen undeserved. The high gods of Erin grant thee speedy restoration
and strong vengeance of thy many wrongs. Sit here, O noble youth,
between me and my only son, Art, heir to my kingdom.""

An attendant took his weapons from the youth and hung them on the wall
with the rest, and Finn sat down between the King of Ireland and his
only son. Choice food was set before him, which he ate, and old ale,
which he drank. From the moment he entered no one thought of anything
but of him. When Finn had made an end of eating and drinking, he said to
the King:"
the-coming-of-finn,4,"""O illustrious prince, though it is not right for a guest to even seem
to observe aught that may be awry, or not as it should be, in the hall
of his entertainer, yet the sorrow of a kindly host is a sorrow, too, to
his guest, and sometimes unawares the man of the house finds succour and
help in the stranger. There is sorrow in this chamber of festivity. If
anyone who is dear to thee and thy people happens to be dead, I can do
nothing. But I say it, and it is not a vain boast, that even if a person
is at the point of death, I can restore him to life and health, for
there are marvellous powers of life-giving in my two hands.""

Conn the Hundred-Fighter answered, ""Our grief is not such as you
suppose; and why should I not tell a cause of shame, which is known far
and wide? This, then, is the reason of our being together, and the gloom
which is over us. There is a mighty enchanter whose dwelling is in the
haunted mountains of Slieve Gullion in the north. His name is Allen, son
of Midna, and his enmity to me is as great as his power. Once every
year, at this season, it is his pleasure to burn Tara. Descending out of
his wizard haunts, he standeth over against the city and shoots balls of
fire out of his mouth against it, till it is consumed. Then he goes away
mocking and triumphant. This annual building of Tara, only to be
annually consumed, is a shame to me, and till this enchanter declared
war against me, I have lived without reproach."""
the-coming-of-finn,5,"""But,"" said Finn, ""how is it that thy young warriors, valiant and swift,
do not repel him, or kill him?""

""Alas!"" said Conn, ""all our valour is in vain against this man. Our
hosts encompass Tara on all sides, keeping watch and ward when the fatal
night comes. Then the son of Midna plays on his Druidic instrument of
music, on his magic pipe and his magic lyre, and as the fairy music
falls on our ears, our eyelids grow heavy, and soon all subside upon the
grass in deep slumber. So comes this man against the city and shoots his
fire-balls against it, and utterly consumes it. Nine years he has burnt
Tara in that manner, and this is the tenth. At midnight to-night he will
come and do the same. Last year (though it was a shame to me that I, who
am the high King over all Ireland, should not be able myself to defend
Tara) I summoned Gaul mac Morna and all the Fians to my assistance. They
came, but the pipe and lyre of the son of Midna prevailed over them too,
so that Tara was burned as at other times. Nor have we any reason to
believe that the son of Midna will not burn the city again to-night, as
he did last year. All the women and children have been sent out of Tara
this day. We are only men of war here, waiting for the time. That, O
noble youth, is why we are sad. The 'Pillars of Tara' are broken, and
the might of the Fians is as nought before the power of this man.""

""What shall be my reward if I kill this man and save Tara?"" asked Finn."
the-coming-of-finn,6,"""Thy inheritance,"" answered the King, ""be it great or small, and whether
it lies in Ireland or beyond Ireland; and for securities I give you my
son Art and Gaul mac Morna and the Chief of the Fians.""

Gaul and the captains of the Fianna consented to that arrangement,
though reluctantly, for their minds misgave them as to who the great
youth might be.

After that all arose and armed themselves and ringed Tara round with
horse and foot, and thrice Conn the Hundred-Fighter raised his awful
regal voice, enjoining vigilance upon his people, and thrice Gaul mac
Morna did the same, addressing the Fians, and after that they filled
their ears with wax and wool, and kept a stern and fierce watch, and
many of them thrust the points of their swords into their flesh.

Now Finn was alone in the banqueting chamber after the rest had gone
out, and he washed his face and his hands in pure water, and he took
from the bag that was at his girdle the instruments of divination and
magic, which had been his father's, and what use he made of them is not
known; but ere long a man stood before him, holding a spear in one hand
and a blue mantle in the other. There were twenty nails of gold of
Arabia in the spear."
the-coming-of-finn,7,"The nails glittered like stars, and twinkled with
live light as stars do in a frosty night, and the blade of it quivered
like a tongue of white fire. From haft to blade-point that spear was
alive. There were voices in it too, and the war-tunes of the enchanted
races of Erin, whom they called the Tuatha De Danan, sounded from it.
The mantle, too, was a wonder, for innumerable stars twinkled in the
blue, and the likeness of clouds passed through it. The man gave these
things to Finn, and when he had instructed him in their use, he was not
seen.

Then Finn arose and armed himself, and took the magic spear and mantle
and went out. There was a ring of flame round Tara that night, for the
Fians and the warriors of Conn had torches in their hands, and all the
royal buildings of Tara showed clear in the light, and also the dark
serpentine course of the Boyne, which flowed past Tara on the north; and
there, standing silent and alert, were the innumerable warriors of all
Erin, with spear and shield, keeping watch and ward against the son of
Midna, also the Four Pillars of Tara in four dense divisions around the
high King, even Conn the Hundred-Fighter.

Finn stood with his back to the palace, which was called the
House-of-the-going-round-of-Mead, between the palace and Conn, and he
grasped the magic spear strongly with one hand and the mantle with the
other."
the-coming-of-finn,8,"As midnight drew nigh, he heard far away in the north, out of the
mountains of Slieve Gullion, a fairy tune played, soft, low, and slow,
as if on a silver flute; and at the same time the roar of Conn the
Hundred-Fighter, and the voice of Gaul like thunder, and the responsive
shouts of the captains, and the clamour of the host, for the host
shouted all together, and clashed their swords against their shields in
fierce defiance, when in spite of all obstructions the fairy music of
the enchanter began to steal into their souls. That shout was heard all
over Ireland, echoing from sea to sea, and the hollow buildings of Tara
reverberated to the uproar. Yet through it all could be heard the low,
slow, delicious music that came from Slieve Gullion. Finn put the point
of the spear to his forehead. It burned him like fire, yet his stout
heart did not fail. Then the roar of the host slowly faded away as in a
dream, though the captains were still shouting, and two-thirds of the
torches fell to the ground."
the-coming-of-finn,9,"And now, succeeding the flute music,
sounded the music of a stringed instrument exceedingly sweet. Finn
pressed the cruel spear-head closer to his forehead, and saw every torch
fall, save one which wavered as if held by a drunken man, and beneath it
a giant figure that reeled and tottered and strove in vain to keep its
feet. It was Conn the Hundred-Fighter. As he fell there was a roar as of
many waters; it was the ocean mourning for the high King's fall. Finn
passed through the fallen men and stood alone on the dark hill-side. He
heard the feet of the enchanter splashing through the Boyne, and saw his
huge form ascending the slopes of Tara. When the enchanter saw that all
was silent and dark there he laughed and from his mouth blew a red
fire-ball at the Teck-Midcuarta, which he was accustomed first to set in
flames."
the-coming-of-finn,10,"Finn caught the fire-ball in the magic mantle. The enchanter
blew a second and a third, and Finn caught them both. The man saw that
his power over Tara was at an end, and that his magic arts had been
defeated. On the third occasion he saw Finn's face, and recognised his
conqueror. He turned to flee, and though slow was his coming, swifter
than the wind was his going, that he might recover the protection of his
enchanted palace before the ""fair-faced youth clad in skins"" should
overtake him. Finn let fall the mantle as he had been instructed, and
pursued him, but in vain. Soon he perceived that he could not possibly
overtake the swift enchanter. Then he was aware that the magic spear
struggled in his hand like a hound in a leash. ""Go, then, if thou wilt,""
he said, and, poising, cast the spear from him. It shot through the dark
night hissing and screaming."
the-coming-of-finn,11,"There was a track of fire behind it. Finn
followed, and on the threshold of the enchanted palace he found the body
of Midna. He was quite dead, with the blood pouring through a wound in
the middle of his back; but the spear was gone. Finn drew his sword and
cut off the enchanter's head, and returned with it to Tara. When he came
to the spot where he had dropped the mantle it was not seen, but smoke
and flame issued there from a hole in the ground. That hole was twenty
feet deep in the earth, and at the bottom of it there was a fire always
from that night, and it was never extinguished. It was called the fire
of the son of Midna. It was in a depression on the north side of the
hill of Tara, called the Glen of the Mantle, Glen-a-Brat."
the-coming-of-finn,12,"Finn, bearing the head, passed through the sleepers into the palace and
spiked the head on his own spear, and drove the spear-end into the
ground at Conn's end of the great hall. Then the sickness and faintness
of death came upon Finn, also a great horror and despair overshadowed
him, so that he was about to give himself up for utterly lost. Yet he
recalled one of his marvellous attributes, and approaching a silver
vessel, into which pure water ever flowed and which was always full, he
made a cup with his two hands and, lifting it to his mouth, drank, and
the blood began to circulate in his veins, and strength returned to his
limbs, and the cheerful hue of rosy health to his cheeks.

Having rested himself sufficiently he went forth and shouted to the
sleeping host, and called the captains by their names, beginning with
Conn. They awoke and rose up, though dazed and stupid, for it was
difficult for any man, no matter how he had stopped his ears, to avoid
hearing Finn when he sent forth his voice of power."
the-coming-of-finn,13,"They were
astonished to find that Tara was still standing, for though the night
was dark, the palaces and temples, all of hewn timber, were brilliantly
coloured and of many hues, for in those days men delighted in splendid
colours.

When the captains came together Finn said, ""I have slain Midna."" ""Where
is his head?"" they asked, not because they disbelieved him, but because
the heads of men slain in battle were always brought away for trophies.
""Come and see,"" answered Finn. Conn and his only son and Gaul mac Morna
followed the young hero into the Teck-Midcuarta, where the spear-long
waxen candles were still burning, and when they saw the head of Midna
impaled there at the end of the hall, the head of the man whom they
believed to be immortal and not to be wounded or conquered, they were
filled with great joy, and praised their deliverer and paid him many
compliments."
the-coming-of-finn,14,"""Who art thou, O brave youth?"" said Conn. ""Surely thou art the son of
some great king or champion, for heroic feats like thine are not
performed by the sons of inconsiderable and unknown men.""

Then Finn flung back his cloak of wild boars' skins, and holding his
father's treasure-bag in his hand before them all, cried in a loud
voice:

""I am Finn, the son of Cool, the son of Trenmor, the son of Basna; I am
he whom the sons of Morna have been seeking to destroy from the time
that I was born; and here to-night, O King of the Kings of Erin, I claim
the fulfilment of thy promise, and the restoration of my inheritance,
which is the Fian leadership of Fail."" Thereupon Gaul mac Morna put his
right hand into Finn's, and became his man. Then his brothers and his
sons, and the sons of his brothers, did so in succession, and after that
all the chief men of the Fians did the same, and that night Finn was
solemnly and surely installed in the Fian leadership of Erin, and put in
possession of all the woods and forests and waste places, and all the
hills and mountains and promontories, and all the streams and rivers of
Erin, and the harbours and estuaries and the harbour-dues of the
merchants, and all ships and boats and galleys with their mariners, and
all that pertained of old time to the Fian leadership of Fail."
the-constable,1,"In a city in the neighborhood of Kaiutschou there once lived a
constable by the name of Dung. One day when he returned from a hunt
after thieves the twilight had already begun to fall. So before he
waded through the stream that flowed through the city he sat down on
the bank, lit a pipe and took off his shoes. When he looked up, he
suddenly saw a man in a red hat dressed as a constable crouching
beside him.

Astonished, he inquired: ""Who are you? Your clothes indicate that you
are a member of our profession, but I have never yet seen you among
the men of our local force. Tell me, pray, whence you come?"""
the-constable,2,"The other answered: ""I am weary, having come a long journey, and would
like to enjoy a pipeful of tobacco in your company. I am sure you will
not object to that.""

Dung handed him a pipe and tobacco.

But the other constable said: ""I do not need them. Just you keep on
smoking. It is enough for me to enjoy the odor."""
the-constable,3,"So they chatted awhile together, and together waded through the
stream. And gradually they became quite confidential and the stranger
said: ""I will be quite frank with you. I am the head constable of the
Nether World, and am subject to the Lord of the Great Mountain. You
yourself are a constable of reputation here in the upper world. And,
because of my skill, I have standing in the world below. Since we are
so well suited to each other, I should like to enter into a bond of
brotherhood with you.""

Dung was agreeable and asked: ""But what really brings you here?"""
the-constable,4,"Said the other: ""In your district there lives a certain Wang, who was
formerly superintendent of the granaries, and at that time caused the
death of an officer. This man has now accused him in the Nether World.
The King of the Nether World cannot come to a decision in the case,
and therefore has asked the Lord of the Great Mountain to settle it.
The Lord of the Great Mountain has ordered that Wang's property and
life be shortened."
the-constable,5,"First his property is to be sequestered here in the
upper world, and then his soul is to be dragged to the nether one. I
have been sent out by the Judge of the Dead to fetch him. Yet the
established custom is, when some one is sent for, that the constable
has first to report to the god of the city. The god of the city then
issues a summons, and sends one of his own spirit constables to seize
the soul and deliver it over to me. Only then may I take it away with
me."""
the-constable,6,"Dung asked him further particulars; but the other merely said: ""Later
on you will see it all for yourself.""

When they reached the city Dung invited his colleague to stay at his
home, and entertained him with wine and food. But the other only
talked and touched neither the goblet nor the chop-sticks.

Said Dung: ""In my haste I could not find any better meal for you. I am
afraid it is not good enough."""
the-constable,7,"But his guest replied: ""Oh no, I am already surfeited and satisfied! We
spirits feed only on odors; in which respect we differ from men.""

It was late at night before he set out to visit the temple of the city
god.

No sooner did morning dawn than he reappeared to take farewell and
said: ""Now all is in order: I am off! In two years' time you will go
to Taianfu, the city near the Great Mountain, and there we will meet
again."""
the-constable,8,"Dung began to feel ill at ease. A few days later, in fact, came the
news that Wang had died. The district mandarin journeyed to the dead
man's natal village in order to express his sympathy. Among his
followers was Dung. The inn-keeper there was a tenant of Wang's.

Dung asked him: ""Did anything out of the ordinary happen when Sir Wang
died?"""
the-constable,9,"""It was all very strange,"" answered the inn-keeper, ""and my mother who
had been very busy in his house, came home and fell into a violent
fever. She was unconscious for a day and a night, and could hardly
breathe."" She came to on the very day when the news of Sir Wang's death
was made public, and said: 'I have been to the Nether World and I met
him there. He had chains about his neck and several devils were
dragging him along. I asked him what he had done, but he said: ""I have
no time to tell you now. When you return ask my wife and she will tell
you all!""' And yesterday my mother went there and asked her. And
Wang's wife told her with tears: 'My master was an official, but for a
long time he did not make any head-way. He was superintendent of the
granaries in Nanking, and in the same city was a high officer, with
whom my master became very intimate.'"
the-constable,10,"He always came to visit at our
house and he and my master would talk and drink together. One day my
master said to him: ""We administrative mandarins have a large salary
and a good income besides. You are an officer, and have even reached
the second step in rank, yet your salary is so small that you cannot
possibly make it do. Have you any other income aside from it?"" The
officer replied: ""We are such good friends that I know I can speak
openly to you. We officers are compelled to find some additional
sources of revenue in order that our pockets may not be altogether
empty. When we pay our men we make a small percentage of gains on the
exchange; and we also carry more soldiers on our rosters than there
actually are present. If we had to live on our salaries we would die
of hunger!"""
the-constable,11,"When my husband heard him say this he could not rid himself of the
idea that by disclosing these criminal proceedings the State would be
indebted to him, and that it would surely aid his plans for
advancement. On the other hand, he reflected that it would not be
right to abuse his friend's confidence. With these ideas in his mind
he retired to his inner rooms. In the courtyard stood a round
pavilion. Lost in heavy thought, he crossed his hands behind his back,
and for a long time walked round and round the pavilion. Finally he
said with a sigh: ""Charity begins at home; I will sacrifice my
friend!"" Then he drew up his report, in which the officer was
indicted."
the-constable,12,"An imperial order was issued, the matter was investigated,
and the officer was condemned to death. My husband, however, was at
once increased in rank, and from that time on advanced rapidly. And
with the exception of myself no one ever knew anything of the matter.
When my mother told them of her encounter with Wang in the Nether
World, the whole family burst into loud weeping. Four tents full of
Buddhist and Taoist priests were sent for, who fasted and read masses
for thirty-five days in order that Wang might be delivered. Whole
mountains of paper money, silk and straw figures were burned, and the
ceremonies have not as yet come to an end."
the-constable,13,"When Dung heard this he was very much frightened.

Two years later he received an order to journey to Taianfu in order to
arrest some robbers there. He thought to himself: ""My friend, the
spirit, must be very powerful indeed, to have known about this trip so
far in advance. I must inquire for him. Perhaps I will see him again."""
the-constable,14,"When he reached Taianfu he sought out an inn.

The inn-keeper received him with the words: ""Are you Master Dung, and
have you come from the bay of Kaiutschou?""

""I am the man,"" answered Dung, alarmed, ""how do you happen to know
me?"""
the-constable,15,"The inn-keeper replied: ""The constable of the temple of the Great Mountain appeared to me last night and said: 'To-morrow a man by the name of Dung who is a good friend of mine is coming from the bay of Kaiutschou!' And then he described your appearance and your clothes to me exactly, and told me to make careful note of them, and when you came to treat you with the greatest consideration, and to take no pay from you, since he would repay me lavishly. So when I saw you coming everything was exactly as my dreams had foretold, and I knew you at once. I have already prepared a quiet room for you, and beg that you will condescend to make yourself at ease."""
the-constable,16,"Joyfully Dung followed him, and the inn-keeper waited on him with the greatest consideration, and saw that he had great plenty to eat and to drink.

At midnight the spirit arrived. Without having opened the door, he stood by Dung's bedside, gave him his hand, and asked how things had gone with him since he had last seen him.

Dung answered all his questions and thanked him into the bargain for appearing to the inn-keeper in a dream.

He continued to live for some days at the inn. During the day he went walking on the Great Mountain and at night his friend came to visit him and talked with him, and at the same time asked him what had happened to Sir Wang."
the-constable,17,"""His sentence has already been spoken,"" answered the other. ""This man pretended to be conscientious, and traitorously brought about the death of his friend. Of all sins there is no greater sin than this. As a punishment he will be sent forth again into the world as an animal."" Then he added: ""When you reach home you must take constant care of your health. Fate has allowed you seventy-eight years of mortal life. When your time is up I will come to fetch you myself. Then I will see that you obtain a place as constable in the Nether World, where we can always be together.""

When he had said this, he disappeared."
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,1,"A famous hunter who lived in a remote part of the North had a fair wife and two sons, who were left in the lodge every day while he went out in quest of the animals whose flesh was their principal support.

Game was very abundant in those days, and his labors in the chase were well rewarded. They lived a long distance from any other lodge, and it was seldom that they saw any other faces than those of their own household.

The two sons were still too young to follow their father in the hunt, and they were in the habit of diverting themselves within reach of the lodge.

While thus engaged, they began to take note that a young man visited the lodge during their father's absence, and that these visits were constantly renewed.

At length the elder of the two said to his mother:

""My mother, who is this tall young man that comes here so often during our father's absence? Does he wish to see him? Shall I tell him when he comes back this evening?"""
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,2,"""Naubesah, you little fool,"" said the mother, ""mind your bow and arrows, and do not be afraid to enter the forest in search of birds and squirrels, with your little brother. It is not manly to be ever about the lodge. Nor will you become a warrior if you tell all the little things that you see and hear to your father. Say not a word to him.""

The boys obeyed, but as they grew older and still noticed the visits of the stranger, they resolved to speak again to their mother.

They now told her that they meant to make known to their father all that they had witnessed, for they frequently saw this young man passing through the woods, and he did not walk in the path, nor did he carry any thing to eat. If he had any message to deliver at their lodge, why did he not give it to their father? for they had observed that messages were always addressed to men, and not to women.

When her sons spoke thus to her, the mother was greatly vexed.

""I will kill you,"" she said, ""if you speak of it."""
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,3,"In fear they for a time held their peace, but still taking note that the stranger came so often and by stealth to the lodge, they resolved at last to speak with their father.

Accordingly one day, when they were out in the woods, learning to follow the chase, they told him all that they had seen.

The face of the father grew dark. He was still for a while, and when at length he looked up-

""It is done!"" he said. ""Do you, my children, tarry here until the hour of the falling of the sun, then come to the lodge and you will find me.""

The father left them at a slow pace, and they remained sporting away their time till the hour for their return had come.

When they reached the lodge the mother was not there. They dared not to ask their father whither she had gone, and from that day forth her name was never spoken again in the lodge.

In course of time the two boys had grown to be men, and although the mother was never more seen in the lodge, in charge of her household tasks, nor on the path in the forest, nor by the river side, she still lingered, ever and ever, near the lodge."
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,4,"Changed, but the same, with ghastly looks and arms that were withered, she appeared to her sons as they returned from the hunt, in the twilight, in the close of the day.

At night she darkly unlatched the lodge-door and glided in, and bent over them as they sought to sleep. Oftenest it was her bare brow, white, and bony, and bodyless, that they saw floating in the air, and making a mock of them in the wild paths of the forest, or in the midnight darkness of the lodge.

She was a terror to all their lives, and she made every spot where they had seen her, hideous to the living eye; so that after being long buffeted and beset, they at last resolved, together with their father, now stricken in years, to leave the country.

They began a journey toward the South. After traveling many days along the shore of a great lake, they passed around a craggy bluff, and came upon a scene where there was a rough fall of waters, and a river issuing forth from the lake.

They had no sooner come in sight of this fall of water, than they heard a rolling sound behind them, and looking back, they beheld the skull of a woman rolling along the beach. It seemed to be pursuing them, and it came on with great speed; when, behold, from out of the woods hard by, appeared a headless body, which made for the beach with the utmost dispatch."
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,5,"The skull too advanced toward it, and when they looked again, lo! they had united, and were making all haste to come up with the hunter and his two sons. They now might well be in extreme fear, for they knew not how to escape her.

At this moment, one of them looked out and saw a stately crane sitting on a rock in the middle of the rapids. They called out to the bird, ""See, grandfather, we are persecuted. Come and take us across the falls that we may escape her.""

The crane so addressed was of extraordinary size, and had arrived at a great old age, and, as might be expected, he sat, when first descried by the two sons, in a state of profound thought, revolving his long experience of life there in the midst of the most violent eddies.

When he heard himself appealed to, the crane stretched forth his neck with great deliberation, and lifting himself slowly by his wings, he flew across to their assistance.

""Be careful,"" said the old crane, ""that you do not touch the crown of my head. I am bald from age and long service, and very tender at that spot. Should you be so unlucky as to lay a hand upon it, I shall not be able to avoid throwing you both in the rapids."""
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,6,"They paid strict heed to his directions, and were soon safely landed on the other shore of the river. He returned and carried the father in the same way; and then took his place once more where he had been first seen in the very midst of the eddies of the stream.

But the woman, who had by this time reached the shore, cried out, ""Come, my grandfather, and carry me over, for I have lost my children, and I am sorely distressed.""

The aged bird obeyed her summons, and flew to her side. He carefully repeated the warning that she was not to touch the crown of his head; and he was so anxious that she should take it to heart, that he went over it a second and a third time, word by word. He begged her to bear in mind that she should respect his old age, if there was any sense of virtue left in her.

She promised to obey; but they were no sooner fairly embarked in the stream, than she stealthily sought to disregard the warning she had received. Instantly the crane cast her into the rapids, and shook his wings as if to free himself of all acquaintance with her."
the-crane-that-crossed-the-river,7,"""There,"" said he, as she sunk in the stream, ""you would ever do what was forbidden. In life, as you sought those you should have avoided, so now you shall be avoided by those who should seek you. Go, and be henceforth Addum Kum Maig!""

The woman disappeared, was straightway carried by the rapid currents far out into the waters, and in the wide wilderness of shoreless depths, without companion or solace, was lost forever.

The family of the hunter, grateful for his generous help, adopted the bird as their family emblem or mark, and under the guardianship of the Crane that Crossed the River, they prospered, with days of plenty and nights of peace."
the-dangerous-reward,1,"Once upon a time a man named Hu-Wu-Bau, who lived near the Great
Mountain, went walking there one day. And there, under a tree, he met
a messenger in a red robe who called out to him: ""The Lord of the
Great Mountain would like to see you!"" The man was much frightened,
but dared offer no objection. The messenger bade him shut his eyes,
and when he was allowed to open them again after a short time, he
found himself standing before a lofty palace. He entered it to see the
god. The latter had a meal prepared for him and said: ""I only sent for
you to-day because I had heard you intended traveling to the West. And
in that case I should like to give you a letter to take to my
daughter."""
the-dangerous-reward,2,"""But where is your daughter?"" asked the man.

""She is married to the river-god,"" was the reply. ""All you need to do
is to take along the letter lying there. When you reach the middle of
the Yellow River, beat against the side of the ship and call out:
'Greencoat!' Then some one will appear and take the letter from you.""

And with these words he handed Hu-Wu-Bau the letter, and he was taken
back again to the upper world."
the-dangerous-reward,3,"When he came to the Yellow River on his journey, he did what the Lord
of the Great Mountain had told him, and cried: ""Greencoat!"" And sure
enough, a girl in green garments rose from the water, took him by the
hand and told him to close his eyes. Then she led him into the palace
of the river-god and he delivered the letter. The river-god
entertained him splendidly, and thanked him as best he knew how. At
parting he said: ""I am grateful that you have made this long journey
to see me. I have nothing to give you, however, save this pair of
green silk shoes. While you are wearing them you can keep on walking
as long as you like and never grow weary. And they will give you the
second sight, so that you will be able to see the spirits and gods."""
the-dangerous-reward,4,"The man thanked him for the gift and returned to his ship. He
continued on his journey to the West, and after a year had passed,
came back again. When he reached the Great Mountain, he thought it
would be fit and proper to report to the god. So he once more knocked
against the tree and gave his name. In a moment the red-clad messenger
appeared and led him to the Lord of the Mountain. So he reported that
he had delivered the letter to the river-god, and how all things were
there, and the Lord of the Mountain thanked him. During the meal which
the god had prepared for him, he withdrew for a few moments to a quiet
spot. Suddenly he saw his deceased father, bound and loaded with
chains, who together with several hundred other criminals, was doing
menial labor."
the-dangerous-reward,5,"Moved to tears, he asked: ""O my father, why are you here?""

His father replied: ""During my life on earth I happened to tread on
bread, hence I was condemned to hard labor at this spot. I have passed
two years in this manner, yet their bitterness has been unspeakable.
Since you are acquainted with the Lord of the Mountain, you might
plead for me, and beg him to excuse me from this task and make me the
field-god in our village."""
the-dangerous-reward,6,"His son promised to do so, and went back and pleaded with the Lord of
the Mountain as he had agreed. The latter seemed inclined to listen to
his prayer, yet said warningly: ""The quick and the dead tread
different paths. It is not well for the dead and the living to abide
near one another permanently."""
the-dangerous-reward,7,"The man returned home. Yet, in about a year's time nearly all his
children had died. In the terror of his heart he turned to the Lord of
the Great Mountain. He beat on the tree; the red-coat came and led him
into the palace. There he told of his misfortune and begged the god to
protect him. The Lord of the Mountain smiled: ""Did I not tell you in
the start that the quick and the dead tread different paths, and that
it is not well if they abide near each other permanently? Now you see
what has happened!"" Yet he sent his messenger to fetch the man's
father. The father came and the god spake to him as follows: ""I
forgave you your offense and sent you back to your home as a
field-god. It was your duty to bring happiness to your family.
Instead, nearly all of your grand-children have died off. Why is
this?"""
the-dangerous-reward,8,"And the father said: ""I had been away from home so long that I was
overjoyed to return. Besides I had meat and drink in overflowing
measure. So I thought of my little grand-children and called them to
me.""

Then the Lord of the Great Mountain appointed another field-god for
that village, and also gave the father another place. And from that
time no further misfortune happened to the family of Hu-Wu-Bau."
the-death-of-the-hen,1,"ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, and they
agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide
it with the other. Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing
about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a
fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat,
so that she was afraid she should choke.

""Cock!"" cried she, ""run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I
shall choke!""

So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, ""Brook, give
me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her
throat."" But the brook answered, ""First run to the bride and ask her for
some red silk."""
the-death-of-the-hen,2,"So the cock ran to the bride and said,

""Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red
silk; I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking
with a big nut stuck in her throat.""

But the bride answered,

""First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow."" And the cock
ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it
to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the
brook, and the brook gave him water. So then the cock brought the water
to the hen, but alas, it was too late; the hen had choked in the
meanwhile, and lay there dead. And the cock was so grieved that he
cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; and six
mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave,
and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock
drove. On the way they met the fox."
the-death-of-the-hen,3,"""Halloa, cock,"" cried he, ""where are you off to?""

""To bury my hen,"" answered the cock.

""Can I come too?"" said the fox.

""Yes, if you follow behind,"" said the cock.

So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear,
the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. And the procession
went on till they came to a brook.

""How shall we get over?"" said the cock. Now in the brook there was a
straw, and he said,

""I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me."" But when
the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into
the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. So they were as
badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself
across and they might pass over him; but no sooner had he touched the
water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. A stone seeing this was
touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across
the stream. And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely
to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind
across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all
tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned."
the-death-of-the-hen,4,"So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he digged a grave
and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself
down and lamented so sore that at last he died. And so they were all
dead together."
the-dragon-princess,1,"In the Sea of Dungting there is a hill, and in that hill there is a
hole, and this hole is so deep that it has no bottom.

Once a fisherman was passing there who slipped and fell into the hole.
He came to a country full of winding ways which led over hill and dale
for several miles. Finally he reached a dragon-castle lying in a great
plain. There grew a green slime which reached to his knees. He went
to the gate of the castle. It was guarded by a dragon who spouted
water which dispersed in a fine mist. Within the gate lay a small
hornless dragon who raised his head, showed his claws, and would not
let him in."
the-dragon-princess,2,"The fisherman spent several days in the cave, satisfying his hunger
with the green slime, which he found edible and which tasted like
rice-mush. At last he found a way out again. He told the district
mandarin what had happened to him, and the latter reported the matter
to the emperor. The emperor sent for a wise man and questioned him
concerning it."
the-dragon-princess,3,"The wise man said: ""There are four paths in this cave. One path leads
to the south-west shore of the Sea of Dungting, the second path leads
to a valley in the land of the four rivers, the third path ends in a
cave on the mountain of Lo-Fu and the fourth in an island of the
Eastern Sea. In this cave dwells the seventh daughter of the
Dragon-King of the Eastern Sea, who guards his pearls and his
treasure. It happened once in the ancient days, that a fisherboy dived
into the water and brought up a pearl from beneath the chin of a black
dragon."
the-dragon-princess,4,"The dragon was asleep, which was the reason the fisherboy
brought the pearl to the surface without being harmed. The treasure
which the daughter of the Dragon-King has in charge is made up of
thousands and millions of such jewels. Several thousands of small
dragons watch over them in her service. Dragons have the peculiarity
of fighting shy of wax. But they are fond of beautiful jade-stones,
and of kung-tsing, the hollowgreen wood, and like to eat swallows. If
one were to send a messenger with a letter, it would be possible to
obtain precious pearls."""
the-dragon-princess,5,"The emperor was greatly pleased, and announced a large reward for
the man who was competent to go to the dragon-castle as his messenger.

The first man to come forward was named So Pi-Lo. But the wise man
said: ""A great-great-great-great-grandfather of yours once slew more
than a hundred of the dragons of the Eastern Sea, and was finally
himself slain by the dragons. The dragons are the enemies of your
family and you cannot go."""
the-dragon-princess,6,"Then came a man from Canton, Lo-Dsi-Tschun, with his two brothers, who
said that his ancestors had been related to the Dragon-King. Hence
they were well liked by the dragons and well known to them. They
begged to be entrusted with the message.

The wise man asked: ""And have you still in your possession the stone
which compels the dragons to do your will?""

""Yes,"" said they, ""we have brought it along with us."""
the-dragon-princess,7,"The wise man had them show him the stone; then he spoke: ""This stone
is only obeyed by the dragons who make clouds and send down the rain.
It will not do for the dragons who guard the pearls of the sea-king.""
Then he questioned them further: ""Have you the dragon-brain vapor?""

When they admitted that they had not, the wise man said: ""How then
will you compel the dragons to yield their treasure?""

And the emperor said: ""What shall we do?"""
the-dragon-princess,8,"The wise man replied: ""On the Western Ocean sail foreign merchants who
deal in dragon-brain vapor. Some one must go to them and seek it from
them. I also know a holy man who is an adept in the art of taming
dragons, and who has prepared ten pounds of the dragon-stone. Some one
should be sent for that as well.""

The emperor sent out his messengers. They met one of the holy man's
disciples and obtained two fragments of dragon-stone from him.

Said the wise man: ""That is what we want!"""
the-dragon-princess,9,"Several more months went by, and at last a pill of dragon-brain vapor
had also been secured. The emperor felt much pleased and had his
jewelers carve two little boxes of the finest jade. These were
polished with the ashes of the Wutung-tree. And he had an essence
prepared of the very best hollowgreen wood, pasted with sea-fish lime,
and hardened in the fire. Of this two vases were made. Then the bodies
and the clothing of the messengers were rubbed with tree-wax, and they
were given five hundred roasted swallows to take along with them."
the-dragon-princess,10,"They went into the cave. When they reached the dragon-castle, the
little dragon who guarded the gate smelled the tree-wax, so he
crouched down and did them no harm. They gave him a hundred roasted
swallows as a bribe to announce them to the daughter of the
Dragon-King. They were admitted to her presence and offered her the
jade caskets, the vases and the four hundred roasted swallows as
gifts. The dragon's daughter received them graciously, and they
unfolded the emperor's letter."
the-dragon-princess,11,"In the castle there was a dragon who was over a thousand years old. He
could turn himself into a human being, and could interpret the
language of human beings. Through him the dragon's daughter learned
that the emperor was sending her the gifts, and she returned them with
a gift of three great pearls, seven smaller pearls and a whole bushel
of ordinary pearls. The messengers took leave, rode off with their
pearls on a dragon's back, and in a moment they had reached the banks
of the Yangtze-kiang. They made their way to Nanking, the imperial
capital, and there handed over their treasure of gems."
the-dragon-princess,12,"The emperor was much pleased and showed them to the wise man. He said:
""Of the three great pearls one is a divine wishing-pearl of the third
class, and two are black dragon-pearls of medium quality. Of the seven
smaller pearls two are serpent-pearls, and five are mussel-pearls. The
remaining pearls are in part sea-crane pearls, in part snail and
oyster-pearls. They do not approach the great pearls in value, and yet
few will be found to equal them on earth.""

The emperor also showed them to all his servants. They, however,
thought the wise man's words all talk, and did not believe what he
said."
the-dragon-princess,13,"Then the wise man said: ""The radiance of wishing-pearls of the first
class is visible for forty miles, that of the second class for twenty
miles, and that of the third for ten miles. As far as their radiance
carries, neither wind nor rain, thunder nor lightning, water, fire nor
weapons may reach. The pearls of the black dragon are nine-colored and
glow by night. Within the circle of their light the poison of serpents
and worms is powerless. The serpent-pearls are seven-colored, the
mussel-pearls five-colored. Both shine by night. Those most free from
spots are the best. They grow within the mussel, and increase and
decrease in size as the moon waxes and wanes.""

Some one asked how the serpent and sea-crane pearls could be told
apart, and the wise man answered: ""The animals themselves recognize
them."""
the-dragon-princess,14,"Then the emperor selected a serpent-pearl and a sea-crane pearl, put
them together with a whole bushel of ordinary pearls, and poured the
lot out in the courtyard. Then a large yellow serpent and a black
crane were fetched and placed among the pearls. At once the crane
took up a sea-crane pearl in his bill and began to dance and sing and
flutter around. But the serpent snatched at the serpent-pearl, and
wound himself about it in many coils. And when the people saw this
they acknowledged the truth of the wise man's words. As regards the
radiance of the larger and smaller pearls it turned out, too, just as
the wise man had said."
the-dragon-princess,15,"In the dragon-castle the messengers had enjoyed dainty fare, which
tasted like flowers, herbs, ointment and sugar. They had brought a
remnant of it with them to the capital; yet exposed to the air it had
become as hard as stone. The emperor commanded that these fragments be
preserved in the treasury. Then he bestowed high rank and titles on
the three brothers, and made each one of them a present of a thousand
rolls of fine silk stuff. He also had investigated why it was that the
fisherman, when he chanced upon the cave, had not been destroyed by
the dragons. And it turned out that his fishing clothes had been
soaked in oil and tree-wax. The dragons had dreaded the odor."
the-elfin-knight,1,"There is a lone moor in Scotland, which, in times past, was said to be
haunted by an Elfin Knight. This Knight was only seen at rare intervals,
once in every seven years or so, but the fear of him lay on all the
country round, for every now and then someone would set out to cross the
moor and would never be heard of again.

And although men might search every inch of the ground, no trace of him
would be found, and with a thrill of horror the searching party would go
home again, shaking their heads and whispering to one another that he
had fallen into the hands of the dreaded Knight.

So, as a rule, the moor was deserted, for nobody dare pass that way,
much less live there; and by and by it became the haunt of all sorts of
wild animals, which made their lairs there, as they found that they
never were disturbed by mortal huntsmen.

Now in that same region lived two young earls, Earl St. Clair and Earl
Gregory, who were such friends that they rode, and hunted, and fought
together, if need be."
the-elfin-knight,2,"And as they were both very fond of the chase, Earl Gregory suggested one
day that they should go a-hunting on the haunted moor, in spite of the
Elfin King.

""Certes, I hardly believe in him at all,"" cried the young man, with a
laugh. ""Methinks it is but an old wife's tale to frighten the bairns
withal, lest they go straying amongst the heather and lose themselves.
And it is pity that such fine sport should be lost because we--two
bearded men--pay heed to such gossip.""

But Earl St. Clair looked grave. ""It is ill meddling with unchancy
things,"" he answered, ""and it is no bairn's tale that travellers have set
out to cross that moor who have vanished bodily, and never mair been
heard of; but it is, as thou sayest, a pity that so much good sport be
lost, all because an Elfin Knight choosest to claim the land as his, and
make us mortals pay toll for the privilege of planting a foot upon it."
the-elfin-knight,3,"""I have heard tell, however, that one is safe from any power that the
Knight may have if one wearest the Sign of the Blessed Trinity. So let
us bind That on our arm and ride forth without fear.""

Sir Gregory burst into a loud laugh at these words. ""Dost thou think
that I am one of the bairns,"" he said, ""first to be frightened by an
idle tale, and then to think that a leaf of clover will protect me? No,
no, carry that Sign if thou wilt; I will trust to my good bow and
arrow.""

But Earl St. Clair did not heed his companion's words, for he remembered
how his mother had told him, when he was a little lad at her knee that
whoso carried the Sign of the Blessed Trinity need never fear any spell
that might be thrown over him by Warlock or Witch, Elf or Demon.

So he went out to the meadow and plucked a leaf of clover, which he
bound on his arm with a silken scarf; then he mounted his horse and rode
with Earl Gregory to the desolate and lonely moorland."
the-elfin-knight,4,"For some hours all went well; and in the heat of the chase the young men
forgot their fears. Then suddenly both of them reined in their steeds
and sat gazing in front of them with affrighted faces.

For a horseman had crossed their track, and they both would fain have
known who he was and whence he came.

""By my troth, but he rideth in haste, whoever he may be,"" said Earl
Gregory at last, ""and though I always thought that no steed on earth could
match mine for swiftness, I reckon that for every league that mine
goeth, his would go seven. Let us follow him, and see from what part of
the world he cometh.""

""The Lord forbid that thou shouldst stir thy horse's feet to follow
him,"" said Earl St. Clair devoutly. ""Why, man, it is the Elfin Knight!
Canst thou not see that he doth not ride on the solid ground, but flieth
through the air, and that, although he rideth on what seemeth a mortal
steed, he is really craried by mighty pinions, which cleave the air like
those of a bird? Follow him forsooth! It will be an evil day for thee
when thou seekest to do that."""
the-elfin-knight,5,"But Earl St. Clair forgot that he carried a Talisman which his companion
lacked, that enabled him to see things as they really were, while the
other's eyes were holden, and he was startled and amazed when Earl
Gregory said sharply, ""Thy mind hath gone mad over this Elfin King. I
tell thee he who passed was a goodly Knight, clad in a green vesture,
and riding on a great black jennet. And because I love a gallant
horseman, and would fain learn his name and degree, I will follow him
till I find him, even if it be at the world's end.""

And without another word he put spurs to his horse and galloped off in
the direction which the mysterious stranger had taken, leaving Earl St.
Clair alone upon the moorland, his fingers touching the sacred Sign and
his trembling lips muttering prayers for protection.

For he knew that his friend had been bewitched, and he made up his mind,
brave gentleman that he was, that he would follow him to the world's
end, if need be, and try to deliver him from the spell that had been
cast over him."
the-elfin-knight,6,"Meanwhile Earl Gregory rode on and on, ever following in the wake of the
Knight in green, over moor, and burn, and moss, till he came to the
most desolate region that he had ever been in in his life; where the
wind blew cold, as if from snow-fields, and where the hoar-frost lay
thick and white on the withered grass at his feet.

And there, in front of him, was a sight from which mortal man might well
shrink back in awe and dread. For he saw an enormous Ring marked out on
the ground, inside of which the grass, instead of being withered and
frozen, was lush, and rank, and green, where hundreds of shadowy Elfin
figures were dancing, clad in loose transparent robes of dull blue,
which seemed to curl and twist round their wearers like snaky wreaths of
smoke.

These weird Goblins were shouting and singing as they danced, and waving
their arms above their heads, and throwing themselves about on the
ground, for all the world as if they had gone mad; and when they saw
Earl Gregory halt on his horse just outside the Ring they beckoned to
him with their skinny fingers."
the-elfin-knight,7,"""Come hither, come hither,"" they shouted; ""come tread a measure with us,
and afterwards we will drink to thee out of our Monarch's loving cup.""

And, strange as it may seem, the spell that had been cast over the young
Earl was so powerful that, in spite of his fear, he felt that he must
obey the eldrich summons, and he threw his bridle on his horse's neck
and prepared to join them.

But just then an old and grizzled Goblin stepped out from among his
companions and approached him.

Apparently he dare not leave the charmed Circle, for he stopped at the
edge of it; then, stooping down and pretending to pick up something, he
whispered in a hoarse whisper:

""I know not whom thou art, nor from whence thou comest, Sir Knight, but
if thou lovest thy life, see to it that thou comest not within this
Ring, nor joinest with us in our feast. Else wilt thou be for ever
undone."""
the-elfin-knight,8,"But Earl Gregory only laughed. ""I vowed that I would follow the Green
Knight,"" he replied, ""and I will carry out my vow, even if the venture
leadeth me close to the nethermost world.""

And with these words he stepped over the edge of the Circle, right in
amongst the ghostly dancers.

At his coming they shouted louder than ever, and danced more madly, and
sang more lustily; then, all at once, a silence fell upon them, and they
parted into two companies, leaving a way through their midst, up which
they signed to the Earl to pass.

He walked through their ranks till he came to the middle of the Circle;
and there, seated at a table of red marble, was the Knight whom he had
come so far to seek, clad in his grass-green robes. And before him, on
the table, stood a wondrous goblet, fashioned from an emerald, and set
round the rim with blood-red rubies."
the-elfin-knight,9,"And this cup was filled with heather ale, which foamed up over the brim;
and when the Knight saw Sir Gregory, he lifted it from the table, and
handed it to him with a stately bow, and Sir Gregory, being very
thirsty, drank.

And as he drank he noticed that the ale in the goblet never grew less,
but ever foamed up to the edge; and for the first time his heart misgave
him, and he wished that he had never set out on this strange adventure.

But, alas! the time for regrets had passed, for already a strange
numbness was stealing over his limbs, and a chill pallor was creeping
over his face, and before he could utter a single cry for help the
goblet dropped from his nerveless fingers, and he fell down before the
Elfin King like a dead man.

Then a great shout of triumph went up from all the company; for if there
was one thing which filled their hearts with joy, it was to entice some
unwary mortal into their Ring and throw their uncanny spell over him, so
that he must needs spend long years in their company."
the-elfin-knight,10,"But soon their shouts of triumphs began to die away, and they muttered
and whispered to each other with looks of something like fear on their
faces.

For their keen ears heard a sound which filled their hearts with dread.
It was the sound of human footsteps, which were so free and untrammelled
that they knew at once that the stranger, whoever he was, was as yet
untouched by any charm. And if this were so he might work them ill, and
rescue their captive from them.

And what they dreaded was true; for it was the brave Earl St. Clair who
approached, fearless and strong because of the Holy Sign he bore.

And as soon as he saw the charmed Ring and the eldrich dancers, he was
about to step over its magic border, when the little grizzled Goblin who
had whispered to Earl Gregory, came and whispered to him also."
the-elfin-knight,11,"""Alas! alas!"" he exclaimed, with a look of sorrow on his wrinkled face,
""hast thou come, as thy companion came, to pay thy toll of years to the
Elfin King? Oh! if thou hast wife or child behind thee, I beseech thee,
by all that thou holdest sacred, to turn back ere it be too late.""

""Who art thou, and from whence hast thou come?"" asked the Earl, looking
kindly down at the little creature in front of him.

""I came from the country that thou hast come from,"" wailed the Goblin.
""For I was once a mortal man, even as thou. But I set out over the
enchanted moor, and the Elfin King appeared in the guise of a beauteous
Knight, and he looked so brave, and noble, and generous that I followed
him hither, and drank of his heather ale, and now I am doomed to bide
here till seven long years be spent.

""As for thy friend, Sir Earl, he, too, hath drunk of the accursed
draught, and he now lieth as dead at our lawful Monarch's feet. He will
wake up, it is true, but it will be in such a guise as I wear, and to the
bondage with which I am bound."""
the-elfin-knight,12,"""Is there naught that I can do to rescue him!"" cried Earl St. Clair
eagerly, ""ere he taketh on him the Elfin shape? I have no fear of the
spell of his cruel captor, for I bear the Sign of One Who is stronger
than he. Speak speedily, little man, for time presseth.""

""There is something that thou couldst do, Sir Earl,"" whispered the
Goblin, ""but to essay it were a desperate attempt. For if thou failest,
then could not even the Power of the Blessed Sign save thee.""

""And what is that?"" asked the Earl impatiently.

""Thou must remain motionless,"" answered the old man, ""in the cold and
frost till dawn break and the hour cometh when they sing Matins in the
Holy Church. Then must thou walk slowly nine times round the edge of the
enchanted Circle, and after that thou must walk boldly across it to the
red marble table where sits the Elfin King. On it thou wilt see an
emerald goblet studded with rubies and filled with heather ale. That
must thou secure and carry away; but whilst thou art doing so let no
word cross thy lips. For this enchanted ground whereon we dance may look
solid to mortal eyes, but in reality it is not so. It is but a quaking
bog, and under it is a great lake, wherein dwelleth a fearsome Monster,
and if thou so much as utter a word while thy foot resteth upon it, thou
wilt fall through the bog and perish in the waters beneath."""
the-elfin-knight,13,"So saying the Grisly Goblin stepped back among his companions, leaving
Earl St. Clair standing alone on the outskirts of the charmed Ring.

There he waited, shivering with cold, through the long, dark hours, till
the grey dawn began to break over the hill tops, and, with its coming,
the Elfin forms before him seemed to dwindle and fade away.

And at the hour when the sound of the Matin Bell came softly pealing
from across the moor, he began his solemn walk. Round and round the Ring
he paced, keeping steadily on his way, although loud murmurs of anger,
like distant thunder, rose from the Elfin Shades, and even the very
ground seemed to heave and quiver, as if it would shake this bold
intruder from its surface.

But through the power of the Blessed Sign on his arm Earl St. Clair went
on unhurt."
the-elfin-knight,14,"When he had finished pacing round the Ring he stepped boldly on to the
enchanted ground, and walked across it; and what was his astonishment to
find that all the ghostly Elves and Goblins whom he had seen, were lying
frozen into tiny blocks of ice, so that he was sore put to it to walk
amongst them without treading upon them.

And as he approached the marble table the very hairs rose on his head at
the sight of the Elfin King sitting behind it, stiff and stark like his
followers; while in front of him lay the form of Earl Gregory, who had
shared the same fate.

Nothing stirred, save two coal-black ravens, who sat, one on each side
of the table, as if to guard the emerald goblet, flapping their wings,
and croaking hoarsely.

When Earl St. Clair lifted the precious cup, they rose in the air and
circled round his head, screaming with rage, and threatening to dash it
from his hands with their claws; while the frozen Elves, and even their
mighty King himself stirred in their sleep, and half sat up, as if to
lay hands on this presumptuous intruder. But the Power of the Holy Sign
restrained them, else had Earl St. Clair been foiled in his quest."
the-elfin-knight,15,"As he retraced his steps, awesome and terrible were the sounds that he
heard around him. The ravens shrieked, and the frozen Goblins screamed;
and up from the hidden lake below came the sound of the deep breathing
of the awful Monster who was lurking there, eager for prey.

But the brave Earl heeded none of these things, but kept steadily
onwards, trusting in the Might of the Sign he bore. And it carried him
safely through all the dangers; and just as the sound of the Matin Bell
was dying away in the morning air he stepped on to solid ground once
more, and flung the enchanted goblet from him.

And lo! every one of the frozen Elves vanished, along with their King
and his marble table, and nothing was left on the rank green grass save
Earl Gregory, who slowly woke from his enchanted slumber, and stretched
himself, and stood up, shaking in every limb. He gazed vaguely round
him, as if he scarce remembered where he was.

And when, after Earl St. Clair had run to him and had held him in his
arms till his senses returned and the warm blood coursed through his
veins, the two friends returned to the spot where Earl St. Clair had
thrown down the wondrous goblet, they found nothing but a piece of rough
grey whinstone, with a drop of dew hidden in a little crevice which was
hollowed in its side."
the-enchanted-moccasins,1,"A long, long time ago, a little boy was living with his sister entirely alone in an uninhabited country, far out in the north-west. He was called the Boy that carries the Ball on his Back, from an idea that he possessed supernatural powers. This boy was in the habit of meditating alone, and asking within himself, whether there were other beings similar to themselves on the earth.

When he grew up to manhood, he inquired of his sister whether she knew of any human beings beside themselves. She replied that she did; and that there was, at a great distance, a large village.

As soon as he heard this, he said to his sister, ""I am now a young man and very much in want of a companion;"" and he asked his sister to make him several pairs of moccasins.

She complied with his request; and as soon as he received the moccasins, he took up his war-club and set out in quest of the distant village."
the-enchanted-moccasins,2,"He traveled on till he came to a small wigwam, and on looking into it he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire. As soon as she saw the stranger, she invited him in, and thus addressed him:

""My poor grandchild, I suppose you are one of those who seek for the distant village, from which no person has ever yet returned. Unless your guardian is more powerful than the guardians of those who have gone before you, you will share a similar fate to theirs. Be careful to provide yourself with the invisible bones they use in the medicine-dance, for without these you can not succeed.""

After she had thus spoken, she gave him the following directions for his journey:

""When you come near to the village which you seek, you will see in the center a large lodge, in which the chief of the village, who has two daughters, resides. Before the door there is a great tree, which is smooth and without bark. On this tree, about the height of a man from the ground, is hung a small lodge, in which these two false daughters dwell. It is here that so many have been destroyed, and among them your two elder brothers. Be wise, my grandchild, and abide strictly by my directions."""
the-enchanted-moccasins,3,"The old woman then gave to the young man the bones which were to secure his success; and she informed him with great care how he was to proceed.

Placing them in his bosom, Onwee Bahmondang, or the Wearer of the Ball, continued his journey, and kept eagerly on until he arrived at the village of which he was in search; and as he was gazing around him, he saw both the tree and the lodge which the old woman had mentioned.

He at once bent his steps for the tree, and approaching, he endeavored to reach the suspended lodge. But all his efforts were in vain; for as often as he attempted to reach it, the tree began to tremble, and it soon shot up so that the lodge could hardly be perceived.

He bethought him of his guardian, and invoking his aid, and changing himself into a squirrel, he mounted nimbly up again, in the hope that the lodge would not now escape him. Away shot the lodge, climb as briskly as he might.

Panting, and out of breath, he remembered the instructions of the old woman, and drawing from his bosom one of the bones, he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and rested himself to be ready to start again."
the-enchanted-moccasins,4,"As often as he wearied of climbing, for even a squirrel can not climb forever, he repeated the little ceremony of the bones; but whenever he came near the lodge and put forth his hand to touch it, the tree would shoot up as before, and carry the lodge up far beyond his reach.

At length the bones being all gone, and the lodge well-nigh out of sight, he began to despair, for the earth, too, had long since vanished entirely from his view.

Summoning his whole heart, he resolved to try once more. On and up he went, and, as soon as he put forth his hand to touch it, the tree again shook, and away went the lodge.

One more endeavor, brave Onwee, and in he goes; for having now reached the arch of heaven, the fly-away lodge could go no higher.

Onwee entered the lodge with a fearless step, and he beheld the two wicked sisters sitting opposite each other. He asked their names. The one on his left hand called herself Azhabee, and the one on the right, Negahnabee."
the-enchanted-moccasins,5,"After talking with them a little while, he discovered that whenever he addressed the one on his left hand, the tree would tremble as before and settle down to its former place; but when he addressed the one on his right hand, it would again shoot upward.

When he thus perceived that by addressing the one on his left hand that the tree would descend, he continued to do so until it had again settled down to its place near the earth. Then seizing his war-club, he said to the sisters:

""You who have caused the death of so many of my brethren I will now put an end to, and thus have revenge for those you have destroyed.""

As he spoke this he raised the club, and with one blow laid the two wicked women dead at his feet.

Onwee then descended, and learning that these sisters had a brother living with their father, who had shared all together in the spoils of all such as the wicked sisters had betrayed, and who would now pursue him for having put an end to their wicked profits, Onwee set off at random, not knowing whither he went."
the-enchanted-moccasins,6,"The father coming in the evening to visit the lodge of his daughters, discovered what had happened. He immediately sent word to his son that his sisters had been slain, and that there were no more spoils to be had, which greatly inflamed the young man's temper, especially the woeful announcement at the close.

""The person who has done this,"" said the brother, as soon as he had reached the spot, chafing and half beside himself at the gloomy prospect of having no more travelers to strip, ""must be that boy who carries the ball on his back. I know his mode of going about his business, and since he would not allow himself to be killed by my sisters, he shall have the honor of dying by my hand. I will pursue him and have revenge.""

""It is well, my son,"" replied the father; ""the spirit of your life grant you success. I counsel you to be wary in the pursuit. Bahmondang is a cunning youth. It is a strong spirit who has put him on to do this injury to us, and he will try to deceive you in every way. Above all, avoid tasting food till you succeed; for if you break your fast before you see his blood, your power will be destroyed."""
the-enchanted-moccasins,7,"The son took this fatherly advice all in good part, except that portion which enjoined upon him to abstain from staying his stomach; but over that he made a number of wry faces, for the brother of the two wicked sisters had, among numerous noble gifts, a very noble appetite. Nevertheless, he took up his weapons and departed in pursuit of Onwee Bahmondang, at the top of his speed.

Onwee finding that he was closely followed, climbed up into one of the tallest trees, and shot forth the magic arrows with which he had provided himself.

Seeing that his pursuer was not turned back by his arrows, Onwee renewed his flight; and when he found himself hard pressed, and his enemy close behind him, he transformed himself into the skeleton of a moose that had been killed, whose flesh had come off from his bones. He then remembered the moccasins which his sister had given him, and which were enchanted. Taking a pair of them, he placed them near the skeleton."
the-enchanted-moccasins,8,"""Go,"" said he to them, ""to the end of the earth.""

The moccasins then left him, and their tracks remained.

The angry brother at length came to the skeleton of the moose, when he perceived that the track he had been long pursuing did not stop there, so he continued to follow it up till he arrived at the end of the earth, where, for all his trouble, he found only a pair of moccasins.

Vexed that he had been outwitted by following a pair of moccasins instead of their owner, who was the object of his pursuit, he bitterly complained, resolving not to give up his revenge, and to be more wary in scrutinizing signs.

He then called to mind the skeleton he had met with on his way, and concluded that it must be the object of his search."
the-enchanted-moccasins,9,"He retraced his steps toward the skeleton, but to his surprise it had disappeared, and the tracks of the wearer of the ball were in another direction. He now became faint with hunger, and lost heart; but when he remembered the blood of his sisters, and that he should not be allowed to enjoy a meal, nor so much as a mouthful, until he had put an end to Onwee Bahmondang, he plucked up his spirits and determined again to pursue.

Onwee, finding that he was closely followed, and that the hungry brother was approaching very fast, changed himself into a very old man, with two daughters, and living in a large lodge in the center of a beautiful garden, which was filled with every thing that could delight the eye, or was pleasant to the taste. He made himself appear so very old as to be unable to leave his lodge, and to require his daughters to bring him food and wait on him, as though he had been a mere child. The garden also had the appearance of old age, with its ancient bushes and hanging branches and decrepit vines loitering lazily about in the sun."
the-enchanted-moccasins,10,"The brother kept on until he was nearly starved and ready to sink to the earth. He exclaimed, with a long-drawn and most mournful sigh, ""Oh! I will forget the blood of my sisters, for I am starving. Oh! oh!""

But again he thought of the blood of his sisters, and what a fine appetite he would have if he should ever be allowed to eat any thing again, and once more he resolved to pursue, and to be content with nothing short of the amplest revenge.

He pushed on till he came to the beautiful garden. He advanced toward the lodge.

As soon as the fairy daughters perceived him they ran and told their father that a stranger approached.

Their father replied, ""Invite him in, my children, invite him in.""

They did so promptly, and, by the command of their father, they boiled some corn, and prepared several other palatable dishes. The savor was most delicious to the nostrils of the hungry brother, who had not the least suspicion of the sport that was going on at his expense.

He was faint and weary with travel, and he felt that he could endure fasting no longer; for his appetite was terribly inflamed by the sight of the choice food that was steaming before him."
the-enchanted-moccasins,11,"He fell to and partook heartily of the meal; and, by so doing, he was overcome, and lost his right of revenge. All at once he forgot the blood of his sisters, and even the village of his nativity, and his father's lodge, and his whole past life. He ate so keenly, and came and went to the choice dishes so often, that drowsiness at length overpowered him, and he soon fell into a profound sleep.

Onwee Bahmondang watched his opportunity, and as soon as he saw that the false brother's sleep was sound, he resumed his youthful form, and sent off the two fairy daughters and the old garden; and drawing the magic-ball from his back, which turned out to be a great war-club, he fetched the slumbering brother a mighty blow, which sent him away too; and thus did Onwee Bahmondang vindicate his title as the Wearer of the Ball."
the-enchanted-moccasins,12,"When Onwee swung around, with the great force and weight of the club with which he had dispatched the brother of the two wicked women, he found himself in a large village, surrounded by a great crowd of people. At the door of a beautiful lodge stood his sister, smiling, and ready to invite him in. Onwee entered, and hanging up his war-club and the enchanted moccasins, which he had recovered, he rested from his labors, and smoked his evening pipe, with the admiration and approval of the whole world.

With one exception only, Onwee Bahmondang had the hearty praises of all the people.

Now it happened that there lived in this same village an envious and boastful fellow, who had been once a chief, but coming home always badly whipped, he was put out of office, and now spent his time about the place mainly, in proclaiming certain great things which he had in his eye, and which he meant to do-one of these days."
the-enchanted-moccasins,13,"This man's name was Ko-ko, the Owl; and hearing much of the wonderful achievements of the Wearer of the Ball, Ko-ko put on a big look, and announced that he was going to do something extraordinary himself.

Onwee Bahmondang, he said, had not half done his work, and he, Ko-ko, meant to go on the ground and finish it up as it should be.

He began by procuring an oak ball, which he thrust down his back, and, confident in its magical powers, he, too, called himself the Wearer of the Ball. In fact it was the self-same ball that Onwee had employed, except that the magic had entirely gone out of it. Coming by night in the shadow of the lodge, he thrust his arm in at the door, and stealthily possessed himself of the enchanted moccasins. He would have taken away Onwee's war-club too, if he could have carried it; but although he was twice the size and girth of Onwee, he had not the strength to lift it; so he borrowed a club from an old chief, who was purblind, and mistook Ko-ko for his brother who was a brave man; and raising a terrible tumult with his voice, and a great dust with his heels, Ko-ko set out.

He had traveled all day, when he came to a small wigwam, and on looking into it, he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire; just as Onwee had before."
the-enchanted-moccasins,14,"This is the wigwam, said Ko-ko, and this is the old woman.

""What are you looking for?"" asked the old woman.

""I want to find the lodge with the wicked young women in it, who slay travellers and steal their trappings,"" answered Ko-ko.

""You mean the two young women who lived in the flying lodge?"" said the old woman.

""The same,"" answered Ko-ko. ""I am going to kill them.""

With this he gave a great flourish with his borrowed club, and looked desperate and murderous as he could.

""They were slain yesterday by the Wearer of the Ball,"" said the old woman.

Ko-ko looked around for the door in a very owlish way, and heaving a short hem from his chest, he acknowledged that he had heard something to that effect down in one of the villages.

""But there's the brother. I'll have a chance at him,"" said Ko-ko.

""He is dead too,"" said the old woman.

""Is there nobody then left for me to kill?"" cried Ko-ko. ""Must I then go back without any blood upon my hands?""

He made as if he could shed tears over his sad mishap.

""The father is still living; and you will find him in the lodge, if you have a mind to call on him. He would like to see the Owl,"" the old woman added.

""He shall,"" replied Ko-ko. ""Have you any bones about the house; for I suppose I shall have to climb that tree.""

""Oh, yes; plenty,"" answered the old woman. ""You can have as many as you want."""
the-enchanted-moccasins,15,"And she gave him a handful of fish-bones, which Ko-ko, taking them to be the Invisible Tallies which had helped Onwee Bahmondang in climbing the magical tree, thrust into his bosom.

""Thank you,"" said Ko-ko; taking up his club and striding toward the door.

""Will you not have a little advice,"" said the old woman. ""This is a dangerous business you are going on.""

Ko-ko turned about and laughed to scorn the proposal, and putting forth his right foot from the lodge first, an observance in which he had great hopes, he started for the lodge of the wicked father.

Ko-ko ran very fast, as if he feared he should lose the chance of massacring any member of the wicked family, until he came in sight of the lodge hanging upon the tree.

He then slackened his pace, and crept forward with a wary eye lest somebody might chance to be looking out at the door. All was, however, still up there; and Ko-ko clasped the tree and began to climb.

Away went the lodge, and up went Ko-ko, puffing and panting, after it. And it was not a great while before the Owl had puffed and panted away all the wind he had to spare; and yet the lodge kept flying aloft, higher, higher. What was to be done!"
the-enchanted-moccasins,16,"Ko-ko of course bethought him of the bones, for that was just what, as he knew, had occurred to Onwee Bahmondang under the like circumstances.

He had the bones in his bosom; and now it was necessary for him to be a squirrel. He immediately called on several guardian spirits whom he knew of by name, and requested them to convert him into a squirrel. But not one of all them seemed to pay the slightest attention to his request; for there he hung, the same heavy-limbed, big-headed, be-clubbed, and be-blanketed Ko-ko as ever.

He then desired that they would turn him into an opossum; an application which met with the same luck as the previous one. After this he petitioned to be a wolf, a gophir, a dog, or a bear-if they would be so obliging. The guardian spirits were either all deaf, or indifferent to his wishes, or absent on some other business.

Ko-ko, in spite of all his begging and supplication and beseeching, was obliged to be still Ko-ko.

""The bones, however,"" he said, to himself, ""are good. I shall get a nice rest, at any rate, if I am forced to climb as I am.""

With this he drew out one of the bones from his bosom, and shouting aloud, ""Ho! ho! who is there?"" he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and would have indulged himself in a rest; but being no more than a common fish-bone, without the slightest savor of magic in it, it snapped with Ko-ko, who came tumbling down, with the door of the lodge which he had shaken loose, rattling after him."
the-enchanted-moccasins,17,"""Ho! ho! who is there?"" cried the wicked father, making his appearance at the opening and looking down.

""It is I, Onwee Bahmondang!"" cried Ko-koor, thinking to frighten the wicked father.

""Ah! it is you, is it? I will be there presently,"" called the old man. ""Do not be in haste to go away!""

Ko-ko, observing that the old man was in earnest, scrambled up from the ground, and set off promptly at his highest rate of speed.

When he looked back and saw that the wicked father was gaining upon him, Ko-koor mounted a tree, as had Onwee Bahmondang before, and fired off a number of arrows, but as they were no more than common arrows, he got nothing by it, but was obliged to descend, and run again for life.

As he hurried on he encountered the skeleton of a moose, into which he would have transformed himself, but not having the slightest confidence in any one of all the guardians who should have helped him, he passed on.

The wicked father was hot in pursuit, and Ko-koor was suffering terribly for lack of wind, when luckily he remembered the enchanted moccasins. He could not send them to the end of the earth, as had Onwee Bahmondang."
the-enchanted-moccasins,18,"""I will improve on that dull fellow,"" said Ko-ko. ""I will put them on myself.""

Accordingly, Ko-ko had just time to draw on the moccasins when the wicked father came in sight.

""Go now!"" cried Ko-ko, giving orders to the enchanted moccasins; and go they did; but to the astonishment of the Owl, they turned immediately about in the way in which the wicked father, now, very furious, was approaching.

""The other way! the other way!"" cried Ko-ko.

Cry as loud as he would, the enchanted moccasins would keep on in their own course; and before he could shake himself out of them, they had run him directly into the face of the wicked father.

""What do you mean, you Owl?"" cried the wicked father, falling upon Ko-ko with a huge club, and counting his ribs at every stroke.

""I can not help it, good man,"" answered Ko-ko. ""I tried my best-""

Ko-ko would have gone the other way, but the enchanted moccasins kept hurrying him forward. ""Stand off, will you?"" cried the old man.

By this time, allowing the wicked father chance to bestow no more than five-and-twenty more blows upon Ko-ko, the moccasins were taking him past.

""Stop!"" cried the old man again. ""You are running away. Ho! ho! you are a coward!""

""I am not, good man,"" answered Ko-ko, carried away by the magical shoes, ""I assure you."" But ere he could finish his avowal, the moccasins had hurried him out of sight.

""At any rate, I shall soon be home at this speed,"" said Ko-koor to himself."
the-enchanted-moccasins,19,"The moccasins seemed to know his thoughts; for just then they gave a sudden leap, slipped away from his feet, and left the Owl flat upon his back! while they glided home by themselves, to the lodge of Onwee Bahmondang, where they belonged.

A party of hunters passing that way after several days, found Ko-ko sitting among the bushes, looking greatly bewildered; and when they inquired of him how he had succeeded with the wicked father at the lodge, he answered that he had demolished the whole establishment, but that his name was not Ko-ko, but Onwee Bahmondang; saying which, he ran away into the woods, and was never seen more."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,1,"Manawyddan the prince and his friend Pryderi were wanderers. The
brother of Manawyddan had been slain. His throne was taken from him.
Very sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade
him be of good cheer. He knew a way out of his trouble.

'And what may that be?' asked Manawyddan.

'It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair
lands that I will give her for dowry. Never did any lady have more wit
than she. In her youth none was more lovely; even yet she is good to
look upon.'

'Thou art the best friend that ever a man had,' said Manawyddan. 'Let us
go now to seek Rhiannon, and the lands where she dwells.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,2,"Then they set forth, but the news of their coming ran swifter still. Rhiannon and Kieva, wife of Pryderi, made haste to prepare a feast for
them. And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning
his mother, and asked if she would take him for her husband. Right
gladly did she consent, and without delay they were married, and rode
away to the hunt, Rhiannon and Manawyddan, Kieva and Pryderi. They
would not be parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the
love between them.

One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green
place. Suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears. A wall of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from
the other. Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone
again upon them. In the place where they were wont to see cattle,
and herds, and dwellings, they beheld neither house nor beast, nor man
nor smoke. Neither was any one remaining in the green place save these
four only."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,3,"'Whither have they gone, and my host also?' cried Manawyddan. They
searched the hall, and there was no man, and the castle, and there was
none. In the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts.
For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed
out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather.
For a time they desired nothing more, but when the next year began they
grew weary.

'We cannot spend our lives thus,' said Manawyddan at last, 'let us go
into England and learn some trade by which we may live.' So they
left Wales, and went to Hereford. There they made saddles, while
Manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings.
And so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles. No others
were bought throughout the whole of Hereford, till the saddlers banded
together and resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,4,"When Pryderi heard of it, he was very wroth, and wished to stay and
fight. But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed. They moved by night
to another city.

'What craft shall we follow?' asked Pryderi.

'We will make shields,' answered Manawyddan.

'But do we know anything of that craft?' answered Pryderi."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,5,"'We will try it,' said Manawyddan. They began to make shields, and
fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen. These
likewise they enamelled. And so greatly did they prosper that no man
in the town bought a shield except they had made it. The
shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to
slay them. But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves
to another town.

'Let us take to making shoes,' said Manawyddan, 'for there are not any
among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us.'

'I know nothing of making shoes,' answered Pryderi, who in truth
despised so peaceful a craft.

'But I know,' replied Manawyddan, 'and I will teach thee to stitch. We
will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,6,"Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather, and for a
goldsmith to fashion the clasps. He himself watched till it was
done, so that he might learn for himself. Soon he became known as 'The
Maker of Gold Shoes,' and prospered so greatly, that as long as one
could be bought from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers
of the town. And the craftsmen were wroth, and banded together to slay
them.

'Pryderi,' said Manawyddan, when he had received news of it, 'we will
not remain in England any longer. Let us set forth to Dyved.'

So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth. There they
gathered their dogs round them, and hunted for a year as before."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,7,"After that a strange thing happened. One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan
rose up to hunt, and loosened their dogs, which ran before them. They came to a small bush. At the bush, the dogs shrank away as if
frightened. They returned to their masters, their hair brisling on their
backs.

'We must see what is in that bush,' said Pryderi, and what was in it was
a boar, with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains. And he came
out, and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him, driven on by the men.
Long he stood at bay. Then at last he betook himself to flight, and fled
to a castle which was newly built, in a place where no building had ever
been known. Into the castle he ran, and the dogs after him, and long
though their masters looked and listened. They neither saw nor heard
aught concerning dogs or boar."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,8,"'I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs,' said Pryderi at
last.

'Truly,' answered Manawyddan, 'thou wouldst do unwisely, for whosoever
has cast a spell over this land has set this castle here.'

'I cannot give up my dogs,' replied Pryderi, and to the castle he went."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,9,"But within was neither man nor beast; neither boar nor dogs, but only
a fountain with marble round it, and on the edge a golden bowl, richly
wrought, which pleased Pryderi greatly. In a moment he forgot about his
dogs, and went up to the bowl and took hold of it. His hands
stuck to the bowl, and his feet to the marble slab, and despair took
possession of him.

Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him. When the sun was
fast sinking, he went home, thinking that he had strayed far.

'Where are thy friend and thy dogs?' said Rhiannon, and he told her what
had befallen Pryderi.

'A good friend hast thou lost,' answered Rhiannon, and she went up to
the castle and through the gate, which was open. There, in the centre of
the courtyard, she beheld Pryderi standing, and hastened towards him."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,10,"'What dost thou here?' she asked, laying her hand on the bowl. As
she spoke she too stuck fast, and was not able to utter a word. Then
thunder was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them. The
castle vanished and they with it.

When Kieva, the wife of Pryderi, found that neither her husband nor
his mother returned to her, she was in such sorrow that she cared not
whether she lived or died. Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart, and
said to her:

'It is not fitting that we should stay here. He have lost our dogs
and cannot get food. Let us go into England--it is easier for us to live
there.' So they set forth."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,11,"'What craft wilt thou follow?' asked Kieva as they went along.

'I shall make shoes as once I did,' replied he. He got all the
finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the
shoes, till everyone flocked to buy. All the shoemakers in the
town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him. But luckily
Manawyddan got word of it. He and Kieva left the town one night and
proceeded to Narberth. He took with him a sheaf of wheat, which he sowed
in three plots of ground. And while the wheat was growing up, he hunted
and fished. They had food enough and to spare. Thus the months
passed until the harvest. One evening Manawyddan visited the
furthest of his fields of wheat; and saw that it was ripe."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,12,"'To-morrow I will reap this,' said he. On the morrow when he went to
reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw.

Filled with dismay he hastened to the second field. There the corn
was ripe and golden.

'To-morrow I will reap this,' he said. On the morrow the ears had
gone, and there was nothing but the bare straw.

'Well, there is still one field left,' he said, and when he looked
at it, it was still fairer than the other two. 'To-night I will watch
here,' thought he. 'Whosoever carried off the other corn will in
like manner take this. I will know who it is.' So he hid himself and
waited."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,13,"The hours slid by, and all was still, so still that Manawyddan well-nigh
dropped asleep. But at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the
world, and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice, which could
neither be numbered nor measured. Each mouse climbed up a straw till
it bent down with its weight. Then it bit off one of the ears, and
carried it away. There was not one of the straws that had not got a
mouse to it.

Full of wrath he rushed at the mice. He could no more come up with
them than if they had been gnats, or birds of the air, save one only
which lingered behind the rest, and this mouse Manawyddan came up with.
Stooping down he seized it by the tail, and put it in his glove, and
tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove, so that the
mouse could not escape. When he entered the hall where Kieva was
sitting, he lighted a fire, and hung the glove up on a peg."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,14,"'What hast thou there?' asked she.

'A thief,' he answered, 'that I caught robbing me.'

'What kind of a thief may it be which thou couldst put in thy glove?'
said Kieva.

'That I will tell thee,' he replied. Then he showed her how his
fields of corn had been wasted, and how he had watched for the mice.

'And one was less nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove.
To-morrow I will hang it, and I only wish I had them all.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,15,"'It is a marvel, truly,' said she, 'yet it would be unseemly for a man
of thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this. Do not meddle with it,
but let it go.'

'Woe betide me,' he cried, 'if I would not hang them all if I could
catch them, and such as I have I will hang.'

'Verily,' said she, 'there is no reason I should succour this reptile,
except to prevent discredit unto thee.'

'If I knew any cause that I should succour it, I would take thy
counsel,' answered Manawyddan, 'but I know of none. I am minded to
destroy it.'

'Do so then,' said Kieva."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,16,"So he went up a hill and set up two forks on the top. While he
was doing this he saw a scholar coming towards him, whose clothes were
tattered. Now it was seven years since Manawyddan had seen man or beast
in that place, and the sight amazed him.

'Good day to thee, my lord,' said the scholar.

'Good greeting to thee, scholar. Whence dost thou come?'

'From singing in England; but wherefore dost thou ask?'

'Because for seven years no man hath visited this place.'

'I wander where I will,' answered the scholar. 'And what work art thou
upon?'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,17,"'I am about to hang a thief that I caught robbing me!'

'What manner of thief is that?' inquired the scholar. 'I see a creature
in thy hand like upon a mouse, and ill does it become a man of thy rank
to touch a reptile like this. Let it go free.'

'I will not let it go free,' cried Manawyddan. 'I caught it robbing me,
and it shall suffer the doom of a thief.'

'Lord!' said the scholar, 'sooner than see a man like thee at such a
work. I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let it
go free.'

'I will not let it go free, neither will I sell it.'

'As thou wilt, lord,' answered the scholar, and he went his way."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,18,"Manawyddan was placing the cross-beam on the two forked sticks, where
the mouse was to hang, when a priest rode past.

'Good-day to thee, lord; and what art thou doing?'

'I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.'

'What manner of thief, lord?'

'A creature in the form of a mouse. It has been robbing me. It shall
suffer the doom of a thief.'

'Lord,' said the priest, 'sooner than see thee touch this reptile, I
would purchase its freedom.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,19,"'I will neither sell it nor set it free.'

'It is true that a mouse is worth nothing. Rather than see thee
defile thyself with touching such a reptile as this, I will give thee
three pounds for it.'

'I will not take any price for it. It shall be hanged as it deserves.'

'Willingly, my lord, if it is thy pleasure.' And the priest went his
way."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,20,"Then Manawyddan noosed the string about the mouse's neck, and was
about to draw it tight. A bishop, with a great following and horses
bearing huge packs, came by.

'What work art thou upon?' asked the bishop, drawing rein.

'Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.'

'But is not that a mouse that I see in thine hand?' asked the bishop.

'Yes; that is the thief,' answered Manawyddan."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,21,"'Well, since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it
of thee for seven pounds, rather than see a man of thy rank touch it.
Loose it, and let it go.'

'I will not let it loose.'

'I will give thee four and twenty pounds to set it free,' said the
bishop.

'I will not set it free for as much again.'

'If thou wilt not set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses
thou seest and the seven loads of baggage.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,22,"'I will not set it free.'

'Then tell me at what price thou wilt loose it. I will give it.'

'The spell must be taken off Rhiannon and Pryderi,' said Manawyddan.

'That shall be done.'

'But not yet will I loose the mouse. The charm that has been cast over
all my lands must be taken off likewise.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,23,"'This shall be done also.'

'But not yet will I loose the mouse till I know who she is.'

'She is my wife,' answered the bishop.

'And wherefore came she to me?' asked Manawyddan."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,24,"'To despoil thee,' replied the bishop. 'It is I who cast the charm
over thy lands, to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud my friend. And it was I
who threw the spell upon Pryderi to avenge Gwawl for the trick that had
been played on him in the game of Badger in the Bag. And not only was I
wroth, but my people likewise. When it was known that thou wast come
to dwell in the land, they besought me much to change them into mice,
that they might eat thy corn. The first and the second nights it was
the men of my own house that destroyed thy two fields. On the third
night my wife and her ladies came to me. They begged me to change them
also into the shape of mice, that they might take part in avenging
Gwawl. Therefore I changed them. Yet had she not been ill and slow of
foot, thou couldst not have overtaken her. Still, since she was caught,
I will restore thee Pryderi and Rhiannon. I will take the charm from
off thy lands. I have told thee who she is; so now set her free.'"
the-escape-of-the-mouse,25,"'I will not set her free,' answered Manawyddan, 'till thou swear that no
vengeance shall be taken for his, either upon Pryderi, or upon Rhiannon,
or on me.'

'I will grant thee this boon. Thou hast done wisely to ask it. On thy head would have lit all the trouble. Set now my wife free.'

'I will not set her free till Pryderi and Rhiannon are with me.'

'Behold, here they come,' said the bishop."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,26,"Then Manawyddan held out his hands and greeted Pryderi and Rhiannon, and
they seated themselves joyfully on the grass.

'Ah, lord, hast thou not received all thou didst ask?' said the bishop.
'Set now my wife free!'

'That I will gladly,' answered Manawyddan. Unloosing the cord from her
neck, and as he did so the bishop struck her with his staff. She
turned into a young woman, the fairest that ever was seen."
the-escape-of-the-mouse,27,"'Look around upon thy land,' said he. 'Thou wilt see it all tilled
and peopled, as it was long ago.' And Manawyddan looked, and saw corn
growing in the fields, and cows and sheep grazing on the hill-side, and
huts for the people to dwell in. And he was satisfied in his soul, but
one more question he put to the bishop.

'What spell didst thou lay upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?'

'Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of my palace hung about him. Rhiannon has carried the collars of my asses around her neck,' said
the bishop with a smile."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,1,"About two hundred years ago there was a poor man working as a laborer
on a farm in Lanarkshire. He was what is known as an ""Orra Man."" That
is, he had no special work mapped out for him to do, but he was expected
to undertake odd jobs of any kind that happened to turn up.

One day his master sent him out to cast peats on a piece of moorland
that lay on a certain part of the farm. Now this strip of moorland ran
up at one end to a curiously shaped crag, known as Merlin's Crag,
because, so the country folk said, that famous Enchanter had once taken
up his abode there.

The man obeyed, and, being a willing fellow, when he arrived at the moor
he set to work with all his might and main. He had lifted quite a
quantity of peat from near the Crag, when he was startled by the
appearance of the very smallest woman that he had ever seen in his life.
She was only about two feet high, and she was dressed in a green gown
and red stockings, and her long yellow hair was not bound by any
ribbon, but hung loosely round her shoulders."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,2,"She was such a dainty little creature that the astonished countryman
stopped working, stuck his spade into the ground, and gazed at her in
wonder.

His wonder increased when she held up one of her tiny fingers and
addressed him in these words: ""What would you think if I were to send
my husband to uncover your house? You mortals think that you can do aught
that pleases you.""

Then, stamping her tiny foot, she added in a voice of command, ""Put back
that turf instantly, or you shall regret this day.""

Now the poor man had often heard of the Fairy Folk and of the harm that
they could work to unthinking mortals who offended them, so in fear and
trembling he set to work to undo all his labour, and to place every
divot in the exact spot from which he had taken it."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,3,"When he was finished he looked round for his strange visitor, but she
had vanished completely. He could not tell how, nor where. Putting up
his spade, he wended his way homewards, and going straight to his
master, he told him the whole story. He suggested that in future the
peats should be taken from the other end of the moor.

But the master only laughed. He was a strong, hearty man, and had no
belief in Ghosts, or Elves, or Fairies, or any other creature that he
could not see. Although he laughed, he was vexed that his servant
should believe in such things, so to cure him, as he thought, of his
superstition, he ordered him to take a horse and cart and go back at
once, and lift all the peats and bring them to dry in the farm steading.

The poor man obeyed with much reluctance. He was greatly relieved, as
weeks went on, to find that, in spite of his having done so, no harm
befell him."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,4,"In fact, he began to think that his master was right, and that the whole
thing must have been a dream.

So matters went smoothly on. Winter passed, and spring, and summer,
until autumn came round once more, and the very day arrived on which the
peats had been lifted the year before.

That day, as the sun went down, the orra man left the farm to go home to
his cottage. As his master was pleased with him because he had been
working very hard lately, he had given him a little can of milk as a
present to carry home to his wife."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,5,"So he was feeling very happy, and as he walked along he was humming atune to himself. His road took him by the foot of Merlin's Crag, and ashe approached it he was astonished to find himself growing strangelytired. His eyelids dropped over his eyes as if he were going to sleep,and his feet grew as heavy as lead.""I will sit down and take a rest for a few minutes,"" he said tohimself; ""the road home never seemed so long as it does to-day.""So he sat down on a tuft of grass right under the shadow of the Crag,and before he knew where he was he had fallen into a deep and heavyslumber."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,6,"When he awoke it was near midnight, and the moon had risen on the Crag.
And he rubbed his eyes, when by its soft light he became aware of a
large band of Fairies who were dancing round and round him, singing and
laughing, pointing their tiny fingers at him, and shaking their wee
fists in his face.

The bewildered man rose and tried to walk away from them, but turn in
whichever direction he would the Fairies accompanied him, encircling him
in a magic ring, out of which he could in no way go.

At last they stopped, and, with shrieks of elfin laughter, led the
prettiest and daintiest of their companions up to him, and cried, ""Tread
a measure, tread a measure, Oh, Man! Then wilt thou not be so eager to
escape from our company."""
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,7,"Now the poor labourer was but a clumsy dancer, and he held back with a
shamefaced air. But the Fairy who had been chosen to be his partner
reached up and seized his hands, and lo! some strange magic seemed to
enter into his veins. For in a moment he found himself waltzing and
whirling, sliding and bowing, as if he had done nothing else but dance
all his life.

And, strangest thing of all! he forgot about his home and his children.
He felt so happy that he had no longer the slightest desire to leave
the Fairies' company.

All night long the merriment went on. The Little Folk danced and danced
as if they were mad, and the farm man danced with them, until at last a
shrill sound came over the moor. It was the cock from the farmyard
crowing its loudest to welcome the dawn."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,8,"In an instant the revelry ceased, and the Fairies, with cries of alarm,
crowded together and rushed towards the Crag, dragging the countryman
along in their midst. As they reached the rock, a mysterious door, which
he never remembered having seen before, opened in it of its own accord,
and shut again with a crash as soon as the Fairy Host had all trooped
through.

The door led into a large, dimly lighted hall full of tiny couches.
Here the Little Folk sank to rest, tired out with their exertions, while
the good man sat down on a piece of rock in the corner, wondering what
would happen next.

But there seemed to be some kind of spell thrown over his senses. Even when the Fairies awoke and began to go about their household
occupations, and to carry out certain curious practices which he had
never seen before, and which, as you will hear, he was forbidden to
speak of afterwards, he was content to sit and watch them, without in
any way attempting to escape."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,9,"As it drew toward evening someone touched his elbow. He turned round
with a start to see the little woman with the green dress and scarlet
stockings, who had remonstrated with him for lifting the turf the year
before, standing by his side.

""The divots which you took from the roof of my house have grown once
more,"" she said, ""and once more it is covered with grass. So you can
go home again, for justice is satisfied--your punishment has lasted long
enough. But first must you take your solemn oath never to tell to mortal
ears what you have seen while you have dwelt among us.""

The countryman promised gladly, and took the oath with all due
solemnity. Then the door was opened, and he was at liberty to depart."
the-fairies-of-merlin-crag,10,"His can of milk was standing on the green, just where he had laid it
down when he went to sleep. It seemed to him as if it were only
yesternight that the farmer had given it to him.

But when he reached his home he was speedily undeceived. For his wife
looked at him as if he were a ghost, and the children whom he had left
wee, toddling things were now well-grown boys and girls, who stared at
him as if he had been an utter stranger.

""Where have you been these long, long years?"" cried his wife when she
had gathered her wits and seen that it was really he, and not a spirit.
""And how could you find it in thy heart to leave the children and me
alone?""

And then he knew that the one day he had passed in Fairy-land had lasted
seven whole years, and he realised how heavy the punishment had been
which the Wee Folk had laid upon him."
the-fairy-nurse,1,"There was once a little farmer and his wife living near Coolgarrow. They
had three children, and my story happened while the youngest was a baby.
The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and
her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep,
and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it
need be. So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before
her one day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a
disorder one of her cows had. She was late at the chapel, and was sorry
all the day after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was
very fond of him.

Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling
out 'Mother! Mother!' When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no
wife by his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of
their mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and
women, dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the
middle of them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her
sleep. Out he ran, and searched everywhere round the house but, neither
tale nor tidings did he get of her for many a day."
the-fairy-nurse,2,"Well, the poor man was miserable enough, for he was as fond of his woman
as she was of him. It used to bring the salt tears down his cheeks
to see his poor children neglected and dirty, as they often were, and
they'd be bad enough only for a kind neighbour that used to look in
whenever she could spare time. The infant was away with a nurse.

About six weeks after--just as he was going out to his work one
morning--a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill, came
up to him, and kept step by step with him to the field, and this is what
she told him."
the-fairy-nurse,3,"Just as I was falling asleep last night, I heard a horse's tramp on
the grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a
fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get
ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. As soon as I put
on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind
him before I felt myself stirring. ""Where are we going, sir?"" says I.
""You'll soon know,"" says he; and he drew his fingers across my eyes,
and not a ray could I see. I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew
whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about
it, till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me. The
fingers went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before
a castle door, and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all
painted in fine green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments,
and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and
grand ladies and gentlemen walking about. At last we came to a bedroom,
with a beautiful lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her. The
lady clapped her hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the
baby, and praised me, and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the
child all over."
the-fairy-nurse,4,"Well, the child I rubbed, sure enough; but my right eye began to smart,
and I put up my finger and gave it a rub, and then stared, for never
in all my life was I so frightened. The beautiful room was a big, rough
cave, with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the
clay; and the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten
creatures--nothing but skin and bone--and the rich dresses were old
rags. I didn't let on that I found any difference, and after a bit says
the Dark Man, ""Go before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in
a few moments, and see you safe home."" Well, just as I turned into the
outside cave, who should I see watching near the door but poor Molly.
She looked round all terrified, and says she to me in a whisper, ""I'm
brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies;
but there is one chance of saving me. All the court will pass the cross
near Templeshambo next Friday night, on a visit to the fairies of Old
Ross. If John can catch me by the hand or cloak when I ride by, and has
courage not to let go his grip, I'll be safe. Here's the king. Don't
open your mouth to answer. I saw what happened with the ointment."""
the-fairy-nurse,5,"The Dark Man didn't once cast his eye towards Molly, and he seemed to
have no suspicion of me. When we came out I looked about me, and where
do you think we were but in the dyke of the Rath of Cromogue. I was
on the horse again, which was nothing but a big rag-weed, and I was
in dread every minute I'd fall off; but nothing happened till I found
myself in my own cabin. The king slipped five guineas into my hand as
soon as I was on the ground, and thanked me, and bade me good night. I
hope I'll never see his face again. I got into bed, and couldn't sleep
for a long time; and when I examined my five guineas this morning, that
I left in the table drawer the last thing, I found five withered leaves
of oak--bad luck to the giver!

Well, you may all think the fright, and the joy, and the grief the
poor man was in when the woman finished her story. They talked and they
talked, but we needn't mind what they said till Friday night came, when
both were standing where the mountain road crosses the one going to
Ross."
the-fairy-nurse,6,"There they stood, looking towards the bridge of Thuar, in the dead of
the night, with a little moonlight shining from over Kilachdiarmid. At
last she gave a start, and ""By this and by that,"" says she, ""here they
come, bridles jingling and feathers tossing!"" He looked, but could see
nothing; and she stood trembling and her eyes wide open, looking down
the way to the ford of Ballinacoola. ""I see your wife,"" says she,
""riding on the outside just so as to rub against us. We'll walk on
quietly, as if we suspected nothing, and when we are passing I'll give
you a shove. If you don't do YOUR duty then, woe be with you!"""
the-fairy-nurse,7,"Well, they walked on easy, and the poor hearts beating in both their
breasts; and though he could see nothing, he heard a faint jingle and
trampling and rustling, and at last he got the push that she promised.
He spread out his arms, and there was his wife's waist within them, and
he could see her plain; but such a hullabulloo rose as if there was an
earthquake, and he found himself surrounded by horrible-looking things,
roaring at him and striving to pull his wife away. But he made the sign
of the cross and bid them begone in God's name, and held his wife as if
it was iron his arms were made of. Bedad, in one moment everything was
as silent as the grave, and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms
of her husband and her good neighbour. Well, all in good time she was
minding her family and her business again; and I'll go bail, after the
fright she got, she spent more time on her knees, and avoided fairy men
all the days of the week, and particularly on Sunday."
the-fairy-nurse,8,"It is hard to have anything to do with the good people without getting
a mark from them. My brave nurse didn't escape no more than another.
She was one Thursday at the market of Enniscorthy, when what did she see
walking among the tubs of butter but the Dark Man, very hungry-looking,
and taking a scoop out of one tub and out of another. 'Oh, sir,' says
she, very foolish, 'I hope your lady is well, and the baby.' 'Pretty
well, thank you,' says he, rather frightened like. 'How do I look in
this new suit?' says he, getting to one side of her. 'I can't see you
plain at all, sir,' says she. 'Well, now?' says he, getting round her
back to the other side. 'Musha, indeed, sir, your coat looks no
better than a withered dock-leaf.' 'Maybe, then,' says he, 'it will be
different now,' and he struck the eye next him with a switch. Friends,
she never saw a glimmer after with that one till the day of her death."
the-fir-tree,1,"There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood. It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, 'What a pretty little one this is!' The tree did not like that at all.

By the next year it had grown a whole ring taller, and the year after that another ring more, for you can always tell a fir-tree's age from its rings."
the-fir-tree,2,"'Oh! if I were only a great tree like the others!' sighed the little fir-tree, 'then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world! The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!' It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much. But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it. 'Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! that is the only pleasure in life,' thought the tree. In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable. But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses. 'Where are they going? What will happen to them?'"
the-fir-tree,3,"In spring, when the swallows and storks came, the fir-tree asked them, 'Do you know where they were taken? Have you met them?'

The swallows knew nothing of them, but the stork nodded his head thoughtfully, saying, 'I think I know. I met many new ships as I flew from Egypt; there were splendid masts on the ships. I'll wager those were they! They had the scent of fir-trees. Ah! those are grand, grand!'

'Oh! if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too! What sort of thing is the sea? what does it look like?'

'Oh! it would take much too long to tell you all that,' said the stork, and off he went.

'Rejoice in your youth,' said the sunbeams, 'rejoice in the sweet growing time, in the young life within you.'

And the wind kissed it and the dew wept tears over it, but the fir-tree did not understand."
the-fir-tree,4,"Towards Christmas-time quite little trees were cut down, some not as big as the young fir-tree, or just the same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away. These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses.

'Whither are those going?' asked the fir-tree; 'they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! Why do they keep their branches? Where are they taken to?'

'We know! we know!' twittered the sparrows. 'Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go! They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine! We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things-golden apples, sweet-meats, toys and hundreds of candles.'

'And then?' asked the fir-tree, trembling in every limb with eagerness, 'and then? what happens then?'

'Oh, we haven't seen anything more than that. That was simply matchless!'"
the-fir-tree,5,"'Am I too destined to the same brilliant career?' wondered the fir-tree excitedly. 'That is even better than sailing over the sea! I am sick with longing. If it were only Christmas! Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year. Ah, if I were only in the cart! If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence! And then? Then comes something better, something still more beautiful, else why should they dress us up? There must be something greater, something grander to come-but what? Oh! I am pining away! I really don't know what's the matter with me!'

'Rejoice in us,' said the air and sunshine, 'rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air!'"
the-fir-tree,6,"But it took no notice, and just grew and grew; there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer, and all who saw it said, 'What a beautiful tree!' And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down. The axe went deep into the pith; the tree fell to the ground with a groan; it felt bruised and faint. It could not think of happiness, it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds. Altogether the parting was not pleasant.

When the tree came to itself again it was packed in a yard with other trees, and a man was saying, 'This is a splendid one, we shall only want this.'"
the-fir-tree,7,"Then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir-tree to a large and beautiful room. There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds-at least, so the children said. The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. How the tree trembled! What was coming now? On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, each full of sugarplums; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches. Dolls as life-like as human beings-the fir-tree had never seen any before were suspended among the green, and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star; it was gorgeous, quite unusually gorgeous!"
the-fir-tree,8,"'To-night,' they all said, 'to-night it will be lighted!'

'Ah!' thought the tree, 'if it were only evening! Then the tapers would soon be lighted. What will happen then? I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me, or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes? Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer?'

It was not a bad guess, but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings.

Now the tapers were lighted. What a glitter! What splendour! The tree quivered in all its branches so much, that one of the candles caught the green, and singed it. 'Take care!' cried the young ladies, and they extinguished it.

Now the tree did not even dare to quiver. It was really terrible! It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance.

And then the folding doors were opened, and a crowd of children rushed in, as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree, whilst the older people followed soberly. The children stood quite silent, but only for a moment, and then they shouted again, and danced round the tree, and snatched off one present after another."
the-fir-tree,9,"'What are they doing?' thought the tree. 'What is going to happen?' And the tapers burnt low on the branches, and were put out one by one, and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree. They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling, it would have been overthrown.

The children danced about with their splendid toys, and no one looked at the tree, except the old nurse, who came and peeped amongst the boughs, just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten.

'A story! a story!' cried the children, and dragged a little stout man to the tree; he sat down beneath it, saying, 'Here we are in the greenwood, and the tree will be delighted to listen! But I am only going to tell one story. Shall it be Henny Penny or Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs, and yet gained great honour and married a princess?'

'Henny Penny!' cried some; 'Humpty Dumpty!' cried others; there was a perfect babel of voices! Only the fir-tree kept silent, and thought, 'Am I not to be in it? Am I to have nothing to do with it?'"
the-fir-tree,10,"But it had already been in it, and played out its part. And the man told them about Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess. The children clapped their hands and cried, 'Another! another!' They wanted the story of Henny Penny also, but they only got Humpty Dumpty. The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that. 'Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess! yes, that is the way of the world!' thought the tree, and was sure it must be true, because such a nice man had told the story. 'Well, who knows? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess.' And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles, toys, glittering ornaments, and fruits. 'To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement. I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour. To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Henny Penny too.' And the tree stood silent and lost in thought all through the night."
the-fir-tree,11,"Next morning the servants came in. 'Now the dressing up will begin again,' thought the tree. But they dragged it out of the room, and up the stairs to the lumber-room, and put it in a dark corner, where no ray of light could penetrate. 'What does this mean?' thought the tree. 'What am I to do here? What is there for me to hear?' And it leant against the wall, and thought and thought. And there was time enough for that, for days and nights went by, and no one came; at last when some one did come, it was only to put some great boxes into the corner. Now the tree was quite covered; it seemed as if it had been quite forgotten."
the-fir-tree,12,"'Now it is winter out-doors,' thought the fir-tree. 'The ground is hard and covered with snow, they can't plant me yet, and that is why I am staying here under cover till the spring comes. How thoughtful they are! Only I wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here; not even a little hare! It was so nice out in the wood, when the snow lay all around, and the hare leapt past me; yes, even when he leapt over me: but I didn't like it then. It's so dreadfully lonely up here.'

'Squeak, squeak!' said a little mouse, stealing out, followed by a second. They sniffed at the fir-tree, and then crept between its boughs. 'It's frightfully cold,' said the little mice."
the-fir-tree,13,"'How nice it is to be here! Don't you think so too, you old fir-tree?'

'I'm not at all old,' said the tree; 'there are many much older than I am.'

'Where do you come from?' asked the mice, 'and what do you know?' They were extremely inquisitive. 'Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world. Is that where you come from? Have you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one dances on tallow candles, and where one goes in thin and comes out fat?'

'I know nothing about that,' said the tree. 'But I know the wood, where the sun shines, and the birds sing.' And then it told them all about its young days, and the little mice had never heard anything like that before, and they listened with all their ears, and said: 'Oh, how much you have seen! How lucky you have been!'

'I?' said the fir-tree, and then it thought over what it had told them. 'Yes, on the whole those were very happy times.' But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve, when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers.

'Oh!' said the little mice, 'how lucky you have been, you old fir-tree!'

'I'm not at all old' said the tree. 'I only came from the wood this winter. I am only a little backward, perhaps, in my growth.'"
the-fir-tree,14,"'How beautifully you tell stories!' said the little mice. And next evening they came with four others, who wanted to hear the tree's story, and it told still more, for it remembered everything so clearly and thought: 'Those were happy times! But they may come again. Humpty dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess; perhaps I shall also marry a princess!' And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too.

'Who is Humpty Dumpty?' asked the little mice.

And then the tree told the whole story; it could remember every single word, and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy!"
the-fir-tree,15,"Next night many more mice came, and on Sunday even two rats; but they did not care about the story, and that troubled the little mice, for now they thought less of it too.

'Is that the only story you know?' asked the rats.

'The only one,' answered the tree. 'I heard that on my happiest evening, but I did not realise then how happy I was.'

'That's a very poor story. Don't you know one about bacon or tallow candles? a storeroom story?'

'No,' said the tree.

'Then we are much obliged to you,' said the rats, and they went back to their friends.

At last the little mice went off also, and the tree said, sighing: 'Really it was very pleasant when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories. But now that's over too. But now I will think of the time when I shall be brought out again, to keep up my spirits.'"
the-fir-tree,16,"But when did that happen? Well, it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber-room; they threw it really rather roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs, where there was daylight once more.

'Now life begins again!' thought the tree. It felt the fresh air, the first rays of the sun, and there it was out in the yard! Everything passed so quickly; the tree quite forgot to notice itself, there was so much to look at all around. The yard opened on a garden full of flowers; the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the swallows flew about, saying: 'Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;' but it was not the fir-tree they meant.

'Now I shall live,' thought the tree joyfully, stretching out its branches wide; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles. The golden star was still on its highest bough, and it glittered in the bright sunlight. In the yard some of the merry children were playing, who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas. One of the little ones ran up, and tore off the gold star.

'Look what was left on the ugly old fir-tree!' he cried, and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet."
the-fir-tree,17,"And the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber-room; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of Humpty Dumpty.

'Too late! Too late!' thought the old tree. 'If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could. Now all is over and gone.'

And a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces, there was quite a bundle of them; they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew-house; the tree sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a pistol-shot; so the children who were playing there ran up, and sat in front of the fire, gazing at it, and crying, 'Piff! puff! bang!' But for each report, which was really a sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer's day in the wood, or of a winter's night out there, when the stars were shining; it thought of Christmas Eve, and of Humpty Dumpty, which was the only story it had heard, or could tell, and then the tree had burnt away.

The children played on in the garden, and the youngest had the golden star on his breast, which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life; and now that was past-and the tree had passed away-and the story too, all ended and done with.

And that's the way with all stories!"
the-fire-god,1,"Long before the time of Fu Hi, Dschu Yung, the Magic Welder, was the
ruler of men. He discovered the use of fire, and succeeding
generations learned from him to cook their food. Hence his descendants
were intrusted with the preservation of fire, while he himself was
made the Fire-God. He is a personification of the Red Lord, who showed
himself at the beginning of the world as one of the Five Ancients. The
Fire-God is worshiped as the Lord of the Holy Southern Mountain. In
the skies the Fiery Star, the southern quarter of the heavens and the
Red Bird belong to his domain. When there is danger of fire the Fiery
Star glows with a peculiar radiance. When countless numbers of
fire-crows fly into a house, a fire is sure to break out in it."
the-fire-god,2,"In the land of the four rivers there dwelt a man who was very rich.
One day he got into his wagon and set out on a long journey. And he
met a girl, dressed in red, who begged him to take her with him. He
allowed her to get into the wagon, and drove along for half-a-day
without even looking in her direction. Then the girl got out again and
said in farewell: ""You are truly a good and honest man, and for that
reason I must tell you the truth."
the-fire-god,3,"I am the Fire-God. To-morrow a fire
will break out in your house. Hurry home at once to arrange your
affairs and save what you can!"" Frightened, the man faced his horses
about and drove home as fast as he could. All that he possessed in the
way of treasures, clothes and jewels, he removed from the house. And,
when he was about to lie down to sleep, a fire broke out on the hearth
which could not be quenched until the whole building had collapsed in
dust and ashes. Yet, thanks to the Fire-God, the man had saved all his
movable belongings."
the-fire-plume,1,"Wassamo was living with his parents on the shore of a large bay, far out
in the north-east.

One day, when the season had commenced for fish to be plenty, the mother
of Wassamo said to him, ""My son, I wish you would go to yonder point and
see if you can not procure me some fish; and ask your cousin to
accompany you.""

He did so. They set out, and in the course of the afternoon they arrived
at the fishing-ground.

The cousin, being the elder, attended to the nets, and they encamped
near by, using the bark of the birch for a lodge to shelter them through
the night.

They lit a fire, and while they sat conversing with each other, the moon
arose. Not a breath of wind disturbed the smooth surface of the lake.
Not a cloud was seen. Wassamo looked out on the water toward their nets,
and he saw that the little black spots, which were no other than the
floats, dotting the lake, had disappeared.

""Cousin,"" he said, ""let us visit our nets; perhaps we are fortunate."""
the-fire-plume,2,"When they drew up the nets they were rejoiced to see the meshes shining
white, all over, with the glittering prey. They landed in fine spirits,
and put away their canoe in safety from the winds.

""Wassamo,"" said the cousin, ""you cook that we may eat.""

Wassamo set about the work at once, and soon had his great kettle swung
upon its branch, while the cousin lay at his ease upon the other side of
the fire.

""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""tell me stories or sing me some love-songs.""

The cousin obeyed, and sung his plaintive songs; or he would frequently
break off in the midst of a mournful chant, and begin to recite a
mirthful story, and then in the midst of Wassamo's laughter he would
return to the plaintive ditty--just as it suited his fancy; for the
cousin was gay of spirit, and shifted his humor faster than the fleecy
clouds that appeared and disappeared in the night-sky over their heads.
In this changeful pastime the cousin ran his length, and then he fell
away, murmuring parts of his song or story, into a silvery sleep; with
the moon gliding through the branches and gilding his face."
the-fire-plume,3,"Wassamo in the mean while had lost the sound of his cousin's voice in
the rich simmer of the kettle; and when its music pleased his ear the
most, as announcing that the fish were handsomely cooked, he lifted the
kettle from the fire. He spoke to his cousin, but he received no answer.

He went on with his housekeeping alone, and took the wooden ladle and
skimmed the kettle neatly, for the fish were very plump and fat. Wassamo
had a torch of twisted bark in one hand to give light, and when he came
to take out the fish, there was no one to have charge of the torch.

The cousin was so happy in his sleep, with the silver moon kissing his
cheeks, as though she were enamored of his fair looks, that Wassamo had
not the heart to call him up.

Binding his girdle upon his brow, in this he thrust the torch, and went
forward, with the light dancing through the green leaves at every turn
of his head, to prepare the evening meal.

He again spoke to his cousin, but gently, to learn whether he was in
truth asleep. The cousin murmured, but made no reply; and Wassamo
stepped softly about with the dancing fire-plume lighting up the gloom
of the forest at every turn he made."
the-fire-plume,4,"Suddenly he heard a laugh It was double, or the one must be the perfect
echo of the other. To Wassamo there appeared to be two persons at no
great distance.

""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""some person is near us. I hear a laugh; awake
and let us look out!""

The cousin made no answer.

Again Wassamo heard the laughter in mirthful repetition, like the ripple
of the water-brook upon the shining pebbles of the stream. Peering out
as far as the line of the torchlight pierced into the darkness, he
beheld two beautiful young females smiling on him. Their countenances
appeared to be perfectly white, like the fresh snow.

He crouched down and pushed his cousin, saying, in a low voice, ""Awake!
awake! here are two young women.""

But he received no answer. His cousin seemed lost to all earthly sense
and sound; for he lay unmoved, smiling, in the calm light of the moon.
Wassamo started up alone, and glided toward the strange females.

As he approached them he was more and more enraptured with their beauty;
but just as he was about to speak to them, he suddenly fell to the
earth, and they all three vanished together. The moon shone where they
had just stood, but she saw them not. A gentle sound of music and soft
voices accompanied their vanishing, and this wakened the cousin."
the-fire-plume,5,"As he opened his eyes, in a dreamy way, he saw the kettle near him. Some
of the fish he observed were in the bowl. The fire flickered, and made
light and shadow; but nowhere was Wassamo to be seen. He waited, and
waited again, in the expectation that Wassamo would appear.

""Perhaps,"" thought the cousin, ""he is gone out again to visit the nets.""

He looked off that way, but the canoe still lay close by the rock at the
shore. He searched and found his footsteps in the ashes, and out upon
the green ground a little distance, and then they were utterly lost.

He was now greatly troubled in spirit, and he called aloud, ""Netawis!
cousin! cousin!"" but there was no answer to his call. He called again in
his sorrow, louder and louder, ""Netawis! Netawis! cousin! cousin!
whither are you gone?"" But no answer came to his voice of wailing. He
started for the edge of the woods, crying as he ran, ""My cousin!"" and
""Oh, my cousin!""

Hither and thither through the forest he sped with all his fleetness of
foot and quickness of spirit; and when at last he found that no voice
would answer him, he burst into tears, and sobbed aloud."
the-fire-plume,6,"He returned to the fire, and sat down. He mused upon the absence of
Wassamo with a sorely-troubled heart. ""He may have been playing me a
trick,"" he thought; but it was full time that the trick should be at an
end, and Wassamo returned not. The cousin cherished other hopes, but
they all died away in the morning light, when he found himself alone by
the hunting-fire.

""How shall I answer to his friends for Wassamo?"" thought the cousin.
""Although,"" he said to himself, ""his parents are my kindred, and they
are well assured that their son is my bosom-friend, will they receive
that belief in the place of him who is lost. No, no; they will say that
I have slain him, and they will require blood for blood. Oh! my cousin,
whither are you gone?""

He would have rested to restore his mind to its peace, but he could not
sleep; and, without further regard to net or canoe, he set off for the
village, running all the way.

As they saw him approaching at such speed and alone, they said, ""Some
accident has happened."""
the-fire-plume,7,"When he had come into the village, he told them how Wassamo had
disappeared. He stated all the circumstances. He kept nothing to
himself. He declared all that he knew.

Some said, ""He has killed him in the dark."" Others said, ""It is
impossible; they were like brothers; they would have fallen for each
other. It can not be.""

At the cousin's request, many of the men visited the fish-fire. There
were no marks of blood. No hasty steps were there to show that any
conflict or struggle had occurred. Every leaf on every tree was in its
place; and they saw, as the cousin had before, that the foot-prints of
Wassamo stopped in the wood, as if he had gone no further upon the
earth, but had ascended into the air.

They returned to the village, and no man was the wiser as to the strange
and sudden vanishing of Wassamo. None ever looked to see him more; only
the parents, who still hoped and awaited his return."
the-fire-plume,8,"The spring, with all its blossoms and its delicate newness of life, came
among them; the Indians assembled to celebrate their vernal feast from
all the country round.

Among them came the sad cousin of Wassamo. He was pale and thin as the
shadow of the shaft that flies. The pain of his mind had changed his
features, and wherever he turned his eyes, they were dazzled with the
sight of the red blood of his friend.

The parents of Wassamo, far gone in despair, and weary with watching for
his return, now demanded the life of Netawis. The village was stirred to
its very heart by their loud lamentings; and, after a struggle of pity,
they decided to give the young man's life to the parents. They said that
they had waited long enough. A day was appointed on which the cousin was
to yield his life for his friend's.

He was a brave youth, and they bound him only by his word to be ready at
the appointed hour. He said that he was not afraid to die; for he was
innocent of the great wrong they laid to his charge."
the-fire-plume,9,"A day or two before the time set to take his life, he wandered sadly
along the shore of the lake. He looked at the glassy water, and more
than once the thought to end his griefs by casting himself in its
depths, came upon him with such sudden force that it was only by severe
self-control that he was able to turn his steps in another direction. He
reflected--""They will say that I was guilty if I take my own life. No. I
will give them my blood for that of my cousin.""

He walked on, with slow steps, but he found no comfort, turn where he
would; the sweet songs of the grove jarred upon his ear; the beauty of
the blue sky pained his sight; and the soft green earth, as he trode
upon it, seemed harsh to his foot, and sent a pang through every nerve.
""Oh, where is my cousin?"" he kept saying to himself.

Meanwhile, when Wassamo fell senseless before the two young women in the
wood, he lost all knowledge of himself until he wakened in a distant
scene. He heard persons conversing. One spoke in a tone of command,
saying, ""You foolish girls, is this the way that you rove about at
nights without our knowledge? Put that person you have brought on that
couch of yours, and do not let him lie upon the ground."""
the-fire-plume,10,"Wassamo felt himself moved, he knew not how, and placed upon a couch.
Some time after, the spell seemed to be a little lightened, and on
opening his eyes, he was surprised to find that he was lying in a
spacious and shining lodge, extending as far as the eye could reach.

One spoke to him and said: ""Stranger, awake, and take something
wherewith to refresh yourself.""

He obeyed the command and sat up. On either side of the lodge he beheld
rows of people seated in orderly array. At a distance he could see two
stately persons, who looked rather more in years than the others, and
who appeared to exact obedience from all around them. One of them, whom
he heard addressed as the Old Spirit-man, spoke to Wassamo. ""My son,""
said he, ""know it was those foolish girls who brought you hither. They
saw you at the fishing-ground. When you attempted to approach them you
fell senseless, and at the same moment they transported you to this
place. We are under the earth. But be at ease. We will make your stay
with us pleasant. I am the guardian Spirit of the Sand Mountains. They
are my charge. I pile them up, and blow them about, and do whatever I
will with them. It keeps me very busy, but I am hale for my age, and I
love to be employed. I have often wished to get one of your race to
marry among us. If you can make up your mind to remain, I will give you
one of my daughters--the one who smiled on you first, the night you
were brought away from your parents and friends."""
the-fire-plume,11,"Wassamo dropped his head and made no answer. The thought that he should
behold his kindred no more, made him sad.

He was silent, and the Old Spirit continued: ""Your wants will all be
supplied; but you must be careful not to stray far from the lodge. I am
afraid of that Spirit who rules all islands lying in the lakes. He is my
bitter enemy, for I have refused him my daughter in marriage; and when
he learns that you are a member of my family, he will seek to harm you.
There is my daughter,"" added the Old Spirit, pointing toward her. ""Take
her. She shall be your wife.""

Forthwith Wassamo and the Old Spirit's daughter sat near each other in
the lodge, and they were man and wife.

One evening the Old Spirit came in after a busy day's work out among the
sand-hills, in the course of which he had blown them all out of shape
with great gusts of wind, and strewn them about in a thousand
directions, and brought them back and piled them up in all sorts of
misshapen heaps."
the-fire-plume,12,"At the close of this busy day, when the Old Spirit came in very much out
of breath, he said to Wassamo, ""Son-in-law, I am in want of tobacco.
None grows about this dry place of mine. You shall return to your
people and procure me a supply. It is seldom that the few who pass these
sand-hills offer me a piece of tobacco,--it is a rare plant in these
parts,--but when they do, it immediately comes to me. Just so,"" he
added, putting his hand out of the side of the lodge and drawing in
several pieces of tobacco which some one passing at that moment offered
as a fee to the Old Spirit, to keep the sand-hills from blowing about
till they had got by.

Other gifts beside tobacco came in the same way to the side of the
lodge--sometimes a whole bear, then a wampum-robe, then a string of
birds--and the Sand-Spirits altogether led an easy life; for they were
not at the trouble to hunt or clothe themselves; and whenever the
housekeeping began to fall short, nothing would happen but a wonderful
storm of dust, all the sand-hills being straightway put in an uproar,
and the contributions would at once begin to pour in at the side windows
of the lodge, till all their wants were supplied."
the-fire-plume,13,"After Wassamo had been among these curious people several months, the
old Sand-Spirit said to him, ""Son-in-law, you must not be surprised at
what you will see next; for since you have been with us you have never
known us to go to sleep. It has been summer when the sun never sets here
where we live. But now, what you call winter, is coming on. You will
soon see us lie down, and we shall not rise again till the spring. Take
my advice. Do not leave the lodge. I have sure knowledge that that
knavish Island Spirit is on the prowl, and as he has command of a
particular kind of storm, which comes from the south-west, he only waits
his opportunity to catch you abroad and do you a mischief. Try and amuse
yourself. That cupboard,"" pointing to a corner of the lodge, ""is never
empty; for it is there that all the offerings are handed in while we are
asleep. It is never empty, and--"" But ere the old Sand-Spirit could
utter another word, a loud rattling of thunder was heard, and instantly,
not only the Old Spirit but every one of his family, vanished out of
sight.

When the storm had passed by, they all reappeared in the lodge. This
sudden vanishing and reappearance occurred at every tempest."
the-fire-plume,14,"""You are surprised,"" said the Old Spirit, ""to see us disappear when it
thunders. The reason is this: that noise which you fancy is thunder, is
our enemy the Island Spirit hallooing on his way home from the hunt. We
get out of sight that we may escape the necessity of asking him to come
in and share our evening meal. We are not afraid of him, not in the
least.""

Just then it chanced to thunder again, and Wassamo observed that his
father-in-law made extraordinary dispatch to conceal himself, although
no stranger, at all resembling in any way the Island Spirit, was in
view.

Shortly after this the season of sleep began, and one by one they laid
themselves down to the long slumber.

The Old Spirit was the last to drop away; and, before he yielded, he
went forth and had his last sport with the sand-hills, and he so tossed
and vexed the poor hills, and scattered them to and fro, and whirled
them up in the air, and far over the land, that it was days and days
before they got back to any thing like their natural shape.

While his relations were enjoying this long sleep, Wassamo amused
himself as best he could. The cupboard never failed him once: for visit
it when he would, he always found a fresh supply of game, and every
other dainty which his heart desired."
the-fire-plume,15,"But his chief pastime was to listen to the voices of the travelers who
passed by the window at the side of the lodge where they made their
requests for comfortable weather and an easy journey.

These were often mingled with loud complainings, such as ""Ho! how the
sand jumps about!"" ""Take away that hill!"" ""I am lost!"" ""Old Sand-Spirit,
where are you? help this way!"" and the like, which indicated that such
as were journeying through the hills had their own troubles to
encounter.

As the spring-light of the first day of spring shone into the lodge, the
whole family arose and went about the affairs of the day as though they
had been slumbering only for a single night."
the-fire-plume,16,"The rest of the Old Spirit
seemed to have done him much good, for he was very cheerful; and, first
putting his head forth from the window for a puff at a sand-hill, which
was his prime luxury in a morning, he said to Wassamo, ""Son-in-law, you
have been very patient with our long absence from your company, and you
shall be rewarded. In a few days you may start with your wife to visit
your relations. You can be absent one year, but at the end of that time
you must return. When you get to your home-village, you must first go in
alone. Leave your wife at a short distance from the lodge, and when you
are welcome, then send for her. When there, do not be surprised that she
disappears whenever you hear it thunder."" He added, with a sly look,
""That old Island Spirit has a brother down in that part of the country.
You will prosper in all things, for my daughter is very diligent. All
the time that you pass in sleep, she will be at work. The distance is
short to your village. A path leads directly to it, and when you get
there, do not forget my wants as I stated to you before."""
the-fire-plume,17,"Wassamo promised obedience to these directions, and, at the appointed
time, set out in company with his wife. They traveled on a pleasant
course, his wife leading the way, until they reached a rising ground.

At the highest point of this ground, she said, ""We will soon get to your
country.""

It suddenly became broad day, as they came upon a high bank; they
passed, unwet, for a short distance under the lake, and presently
emerged from the water at the sand-banks, just off the shore where
Wassamo had set his nets on the night when he had been borne away by the
two strange females.

He now left his wife sheltered in a neighboring wood, while he advanced
toward the village alone.

Musing sadly, and from time to time breaking forth in mournful cries, as
he walked the shore, it was his cousin that Wassamo beheld as he turned
the first point of land by the lake."
the-fire-plume,18,"With the speed of lightning the cousin rushed forward. ""Netawis!
Netawis!"" he cried, ""is it indeed you? Whence have you come, oh, my
cousin?""

They fell upon each other's necks, and wept aloud. And then, without
further delay or question, the cousin ran off with breathless dispatch
to the village. He seemed like a shadow upon the open ground, he sped so
fast.

He entered the lodge where sat the mother of Wassamo in mourning for her
son. ""Hear me,"" said the cousin. ""I have seen him whom you accuse me of
having killed. He will be here even while we speak.""

He had scarcely uttered these words when the whole village was astir in
an instant. All ran out and strained their eyes to catch the first view
of him whom they had thought dead. And when Wassamo came forward, they
at first fell from him as though he had been in truth one returned from
the Spirit-land. He entered the lodge of his parents. They saw that it
was Wassamo, living, breathing and as they had ever known him. And joy
lit up the lodge-circle as though a new fire had been kindled in the
eyes of his friends and kinsfolk."
the-fire-plume,19,"He related all that had happened to him from the moment of his leaving
the temporary night-lodge with the flame on his head. He told them of
the strange land in which he had sojourned during his absence. He added
to his mother, apart from the company, that he was married, and that he
had left his wife at a short distance from the village.

She went out immediately in search of her; they soon found her in the
wood, and all the women in the village conducted her in honor to the
lodge of her new relations. The Indian people were astonished at her
beauty, at the whiteness of her skin, and still more, that she was able
to talk with them in their own language.

The village was happy, and the feast went on as long as the supply held
out. All were delighted to make the acquaintance of the old
Sand-Spirit's daughter; and as they had heard that he was a magician and
guardian of great power, the tobacco which he had sent for by his
son-in-law, came in, in great abundance, with every visitor.

The summer and fall which Wassamo thus passed with his parents and the
people of his tribe were prosperous with all the country."
the-fire-plume,20,"The cousin of Wassamo recovered heart, and sang once more his sad or
mirthful chants, just as the humor was upon him; but he kept close by
Wassamo, and watched him in all his movements. He made it a point to ask
many questions of the country he came from; some of which his cousin
replied to, but others were left entirely in the dark.

At every thunder-storm, as the old Sand-Spirit had foreboded, the wife
of Wassamo disappeared, much to the astonishment of her Indian company,
and, to their greater wonder, she was never idle, night nor day.

When the winter came on, Wassamo prepared for her a comfortable lodge,
to which she withdrew for her long sleep; and he gave notice to his
friends that they must not disturb her, as she would not be with them
again until the spring returned.

Before lying down, she said to her husband, ""No one but yourself must
pass on this side of the lodge.""

The winter passed away with snows, and sports and stones in the lodge;
and when the sap of the maple began to flow, the wife of Wassamo
wakened, and she immediately set about work as before. She helped at
the maple-trees with the others; and, as if luck were in her presence,
the sugar-harvest was greater than had been ever known in all that
region."
the-fire-plume,21,"The gifts of tobacco, after this, came in even more freely than they had
at first; and as each brought his bundle to the lodge of Wassamo, he
asked for the usual length of life, for success as a hunter, and for a
plentiful supply of food. They particularly desired that the sand-hills
might be kept quiet, so that their lands might be moist, and their eyes
clear of dust to sight the game.

Wassamo replied that he would mention each of their requests to his
father-in-law.

The tobacco was stored in sacks, and on the outside of the skins, that
there might be no mistake as to their wants, each one who had given
tobacco had painted and marked in distinct characters the totem or
family emblem of his family and tribe. These the old Sand-Spirit could
read at his leisure, and do what he thought best for each of his various
petitioners.

When the time for his return arrived, Wassamo warned his people that
they should not follow him nor attempt to take note how he disappeared.
He then took the moose-skin sacks filled with tobacco, and bade farewell
to all but Netawis. He insisted on the privilege of attending Wassamo
and his wife for a distance, and when they reached the sand-banks he
expressed the strongest wish to proceed with them on their journey.
Wassamo told him that it could not be; that only spirits could exert the
necessary power, and that there were no such spirits at hand."
the-fire-plume,22,"They then took an affectionate leave of each other, Wassamo enjoining it
upon his cousin, at risk of his life, to not look back when he had once
started to return.

The cousin, sore at heart, but constrained to obey, parted from them,
and as he walked sadly away, he heard a gliding noise as of the sound of
waters that were cleaved.

He returned home, and told his friends that Wassamo and his wife had
disappeared, but that he knew not how. No one doubted his word in any
thing now.

Wassamo with his wife soon reached their home at the hills. The old
Sand-Spirit was in excellent health, and delighted to see them. He
hailed their return with open arms; and he opened his arms so very wide,
that when he closed them he not only embraced Wassamo and his wife, but
all of the tobacco-sacks which they had brought with them.

The requests of the Indian people were made known to him; he replied
that he would attend to all, but that he must first invite his friends
to smoke with him. Accordingly he at once dispatched his pipe-bearer and
confidential aid to summon various Spirits of his acquaintance, and set
the time for them to come."
the-fire-plume,23,"Meanwhile he had a word of advice for his son-in-law Wassamo. ""My son,""
said he, ""some of these Manitoes that I have asked to come here are of a
very wicked temper, and I warn you especially of that Island Spirit who
wished to marry my daughter. He is a very bad-hearted Monedo, and would
like to do you harm. Some of the company you will, however, find to be
very friendly. A caution for you. When they come in, do you sit close by
your wife; if you do not, you will be lost. She only can save you; for
those who are expected to come are so powerful that they will otherwise
draw you from your seat, and toss you out of the lodge as though you
were a feather. You have only to observe my words and all will be well.""

Wassamo took heed to what the Old Spirit said, and answered that he
would obey."
the-fire-plume,24,"About mid-day the company began to assemble; and such a company Wassamo
had never looked on before. There were Spirits from all parts of the
country; such strange-looking persons, and in dresses so wild and
outlandish! One entered who smiled on him. This, Wassamo was informed,
was a Spirit who had charge of the affairs of a tribe in the North, and
he was as pleasant and cheery a Spirit as one would wish to see. Soon
after, Wassamo heard a great rumbling and roaring, as of waters tumbling
over rocks; and presently, with a vast bluster, and fairly shaking the
lodge with his deep-throated hail of welcome to the old Sand-Spirit, in
rolled another, who was the Guardian Spirit and special director of a
great cataract or water-fall not far off."
the-fire-plume,25,"Then came with crashing steps the owner of several whirlwinds, which
were in the habit of raging about in the neighboring country. And
following this one, glided in a sweet-spoken, gentle-faced little
Spirit, who was understood to represent a summer-gale that was
accustomed to blow, toward evening, in at the lodge-doors, and to be
particularly well disposed toward young lovers.

The last to appear was a great rocky-headed fellow; and he was twice as
stony in his manners; and swaggered and strided in, and raised such a
commotion with his great green blanket when he shook it, that Wassamo
was nearly taken off his feet; and it was only by main force that he was
able to cling by his wife. This, which was the last to enter, was that
wicked Island Spirit, who looked grim enough at Wassamo's wife, who had
rejected him, as he passed in.

Soon after, the old Sand-Spirit, who was a great speech-maker, arose and
addressed the assembly."
the-fire-plume,26,"""Brothers,"" he said, ""I have invited you to partake with me of the
offerings made by the mortals on earth, which have been brought by our
relation,"" pointing to Wassamo. ""Brothers, you see their wishes and
desires plainly set forth here,"" laying his hand upon the figured
moose-skins. ""The offering is worthy of our consideration. Brothers, I
see nothing on my part to hinder our granting their requests; they do
not appear to be unreasonable. Brothers, the offer is gratifying. It is
tobacco--an article which we have lacked until we scarcely knew how to
use our pipes. Shall we grant their requests? One thing more I would
say. Brothers, it is this: There is my son-in law; he is mortal. I wish
to detain him with me, and it is with us jointly to make him one of us.""

""Hoke! hoke!"" ran through the whole company of Spirits, and ""Hoke!
hoke!"" they cried again. And it was understood that the petitioners were
to have all they asked, and that Wassamo was thenceforward fairly
accepted as a member of the great family of Spirits.

As a wedding-gift, the Old Spirit asked his son-in-law to make one
request, which should be promptly granted.

""Let there be no sand-squalls among my father's people for three months
to come,"" said Wassamo.

""So shall it be,"" answered the old Sand-Spirit."
the-fire-plume,27,"The tobacco was now divided in equal shares among the company. They
filled their pipes--and huge pipes they were--and such clouds they blew,
that they rushed forth out of the lodge and brought on night, in all
the country round about, several hours before its time.

After a while passed in silence, the Spirits rose up, and bearing off
their tobacco-sacks, they went smoking through the country, and losing
themselves in their own fog, till a late hour in the morning, when all
of their pipes being burned out, each departed on his own business.

The very next day the old Sand-Spirit, who was very much pleased with
the turn affairs had taken at his entertainment, addressed Wassamo:
""Son-in-law, I have made up my mind to allow you another holiday as an
acknowledgment of the handsome manner in which you acquitted yourself of
your embassy. You may visit your parents and relatives once more, to
tell them that their wishes are granted, and to take your leave of them
forever. You can never, after, visit them again.""

Wassamo at once set out, reached his people, and was heartily welcomed.

They asked for his wife, and Wassamo informed them that she had tarried
at home to look after a son, a fine little Sand-Spirit, who had been
born to them since his return.

Having delivered all of his messages and passed a happy time, Wassamo
said, ""I must now bid you all farewell forever."""
the-fire-plume,28,"His parents and friends raised their voices in loud lamentation; they
clung to him, and as a special favor, which he could now grant, being
himself a spirit, he allowed them to accompany him to the sand-banks.

They all seated themselves to watch his last farewell. The day was mild;
the sky clear, not a cloud appearing to dim the heavens, nor a breath of
wind to ruffle the tranquil waters. A perfect silence fell upon the
company. They gazed with eager eyes fastened on Wassamo, as he waded out
into the water, waving his hands. They saw him descend, more and more,
into the depths. They beheld the waves close over his head, and a loud
and piercing wail went up which rent the sky.

They looked again; a red flame, as if the sun had glanced on a billow,
lighted the spot for an instant; but the Feather of Flames, Wassamo of
the Fire-Plume, had disappeared from home and kindred, and the familiar
paths of his youth, forever."
the-flying-ogre,1,"There once lived in Sianfu an old Buddhist monk, who loved to wander
in lonely places. In the course of his wanderings he once came to the
Kuku-Nor, and there he saw a tree which was a thousand feet high and
many cords in breadth. It was hollow inside and one could see the sky
shining down into it from above."
the-flying-ogre,2,"When he had gone on a few miles, he saw in the distance a girl in a
red coat, barefoot, and with unbound hair, who was running as fast as
the wind. In a moment she stood before him.

""Take pity on me and save my life!"" said she to him."
the-flying-ogre,3,"When the monk asked her what was the trouble, she replied: ""A man is
pursuing me. If you will tell him you have not seen me, I will be
grateful to you all my life long!""

With that she ran up to the hollow tree and crawled into it."
the-flying-ogre,4,"When the monk had gone a little further, he met one who rode an
armored steed. He wore a garment of gold, a bow was slung across his
shoulders, and a sword hung at his side. His horse ran with the speed
of lightning, and covered a couple of miles with every step. Whether
it ran in the air or on the ground, its speed was the same."
the-flying-ogre,5,"""Have you seen the girl in the red coat?"" asked the stranger. And when
the monk replied that he had seen nothing, the other continued:
""Bonze, you should not lie! This girl is not a human being, but a
flying ogre. Of flying ogres there are thousands of varieties, who
bring ruin to people everywhere. I have already slain a countless
number of them, and have pretty well done away with them. But this one
is the worst of all. Last night the Lord of the Heavens gave me a
triple command, and that is the reason I have hurried down from the
skies. There are eight thousand of us under way in all directions to
catch this monster. If you do not tell the truth, monk, then you are
sinning against heaven itself!"""
the-flying-ogre,6,"Upon that the monk did not dare deceive him, but pointed to the hollow
tree. The messenger of the skies dismounted, stepped into the tree and
looked about him. Then he once more mounted his horse, which carried
him up the hollow trunk and out at the end of the tree. The monk
looked up and could see a small, red flame come out of the tree-top.
It was followed by the messenger of the skies. Both rose up to the
clouds and disappeared. After a time there fell a rain of blood. The
ogre had probably been hit by an arrow or captured.

Afterward the monk told the tale to the scholar who wrote it down."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,1,"There was once a Fox and a Wolf, who set up house together in a cave near the sea-shore. Although you may not think so, they got on very well for a time, for they went out hunting all day, and when they came back
at night they were generally too tired to do anything but to eat their supper and go to bed.

They might have lived together always had it not been for the slyness and greediness of the Fox, who tried to over-reach his companion, who was not nearly so clever as he was.

And this was how it came about."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,2,"It chanced, one dark December night, that there was a dreadful storm at sea, and in the morning the beach was all strewn with wreckage. So as soon as it was daylight the two friends went down to the shore to see
if they could find anything to eat.

They had the good fortune to light on a great Keg of Butter, which had been washed overboard from some ship on its way home from Ireland, where, as all the world knows, folk are famous for their butter.

The simple Wolf danced with joy when he saw it. ""Marrowbones and trotters! but we will have a good supper this night,"" cried he, licking his lips. ""Let us set to work at once and roll it up to the cave."""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,3,"But the wily Fox was fond of butter, and he made up his mind that he would have it all to himself. So he put on his wisest look, and shook his head gravely.

""You have no prudence, my friend,"" he said reproachfully, ""else would you not talk of breaking up a Keg of Butter at this time of year, when
the stackyards are full of good grain, which can be had for the eating, and the farmyards are stocked with nice fat ducks and poultry. No, no. It behoveth us to have foresight, and to lay up in store for the spring,
when the grain is all threshed, and the stackyards are bare, and the poultry have gone to market. So we will e'en bury the Keg, and dig it up when we have need of it.""

Very reluctantly, for he was thinner and hungrier than the Fox, the Wolf agreed to this proposal. So a hole was dug, and the Keg was buried, and the two animals went off hunting as usual."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,4,"About a week passed by: then one day the Fox came into the cave, and flung himself down on the ground as if he were very much exhausted. But if anyone had looked at him closely they would have seen a sly twinkle
in his eye.

""Oh, dear, oh, dear!"" he sighed. ""Life is a heavy burden.""

""What have befallen you?"" asked the Wolf, who was ever kind and
soft-hearted.

""Some friends of mine, who live over the hills yonder, are wanting me to go to a christening to-night. Just think of the distance that I must
travel.""

""But do you need to go?"" asked the Wolf. ""Can you not send an excuse?""

""I doubt that no excuse would be accepted,"" answered the Fox, ""for they asked me to stand god-father. Therefore it behoveth me to do my duty,
and pay no heed to my own feelings."""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,5,"So that evening the Fox was absent, and the Wolf was alone in the cave. But it was not to a christening that the sly Fox went; it was to the Keg of Butter that was buried in the sand. About midnight he returned, looking fat and sleek, and well pleased with himself.

The Wolf had been dozing, but he looked up drowsily as his companion entered. ""Well, how did they name the bairn?"" he asked.

""They gave it a queer name,"" answered the Fox. ""One of the queerest
names that I ever heard.""

""And what was that?"" questioned the Wolf.

""Nothing less than 'Blaisean' (Let-me-taste),"" replied the Fox, throwing himself down in his corner. And if the Wolf could have seen him in the darkness he would have noticed that he was laughing to himself."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,6,"Some days afterwards the same thing happened. The Fox was asked to another christening; this time at a place some twenty-five miles along the shore. And as he had grumbled before, so he grumbled again; but he declared that it was his duty to go, and he went.

At midnight he came back, smiling to himself and with no appetite for his supper. And when the Wolf asked him the name of the child, he answered that it was a more extraordinary name than the other--""Be na Inheadnon"" (Be in its middle).

The very next week, much to the Wolf's wonder, the Fox was asked to yet another christening. And this time the name of the child was ""Sgriot an Clar"" (Scrape the staves). After that the invitations ceased."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,7,"Time went on, and the hungry spring came, and the Fox and the Wolf had their larder bare, for food was scarce, and the weather was bleak and cold.

""Let us go and dig up the Keg of Butter,"" said the Wolf. ""Methinks that now is the time we need it.""

The Fox agreed--having made up his mind how he would act--and the two set out to the place where the Keg had been hidden. They scraped away the sand, and uncovered it; but, needless to say, they found it empty."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,8,"""This is your work,"" said the Fox angrily, turning to the poor, innocent
Wolf. ""You have crept along here while I was at the christenings, and eaten it up by stealth.""

""Not I,"" replied the Wolf. ""I have never been near the spot since the
day that we buried it together.""

""But I tell you it must have been you,"" insisted the Fox, ""for no
other creature knew it was there except ourselves. And, besides, I can see by the sleekness of your fur that you have fared well of late."""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,9,"Which last sentence was both unjust and untrue, for the poor Wolf looked as lean and badly nourished as he could possibly be.

So back they both went to the cave, arguing all the way. The Fox
declaring that the Wolf  must have been the thief, and the Wolf
protesting his innocence.

""Are you ready to swear to it?"" said the Fox at last; though why he
asked such a question, dear only knows.

""Yes, I am,"" replied the Wolf firmly; and, standing in the middle of
the cave, and holding one paw up solemnly he swore this awful oath:

    ""If it be that I stole the butter; if it be, if it be--
    May a fateful, fell disease fall on me, fall on me."""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,10,"When he was finished, he put down his paw and, turning to the Fox,
looked at him keenly; for all at once it struck him that his fur looked
sleek and fine.

""It is your turn now,"" he said. ""I have sworn, and you must do so also.""

The Fox's face fell at these words, for although he was both untruthful and dishonest now, he had been well brought up in his youth, and he knew that it was a terrible thing to perjure oneself and swear falsely."
the-fox-and-the-wolf,11,"So he made one excuse after another, but the Wolf, who was getting more and more suspicious every moment, would not listen to him.

So, as he had not courage to tell the truth, he was forced at last to
swear an oath also, and this was what he swore:

    ""If it be that I stole the butter; if it be, if it be--
    Then let some most deadly punishment fall on me, fall on me--
    Whirrum wheeckam, whirrum wheeckam,
    Whirram whee, whirram whee!"""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,12,"After he had heard him swear this terrible oath, the Wolf thought that his suspicions must be groundless, and he would have let the matter rest; but the Fox, having an uneasy conscience, could not do so. So he suggested that as it was clear that one of them must have eaten the Keg of Butter, they should both stand near the fire; so that when they became hot, the butter would ooze out of the skin of whichever of them was guilty. And he took care that the Wolf should stand in the hottest place.

But the fire was big and the cave was small; and while the poor lean
Wolf showed no sign of discomfort, he himself, being nice and fat and comfortable, soon began to get unpleasantly warm.

As this did not suit him at all, he next proposed that they should go
for a walk, ""for,"" said he, ""it is now quite plain that neither of us
can have taken the butter. It must have been some stranger who hath found out our secret."""
the-fox-and-the-wolf,13,"But the Wolf had seen the Fox beginning to grow greasy, and he knew now what had happened, and he determined to have his revenge. So he waited until they came to a smithy which stood at the side of the road, where a horse was waiting just outside the door to be shod.

Then, keeping at a safe distance, he said to his companion, ""There is
writing on that smithy door, which I cannot read, as my eyes are
failing; do thou try to read it, for perchance it may be something
it were good for us to know.""

And the silly Fox, who was very vain, and did not like to confess that
his eyes were no better than those of his friend, went close up to the
door to try and read the writing. And he chanced to touch the horse's
fetlock, and, it being a restive beast, lifted its foot and struck out
at once, and killed the Fox as dead as a door-nail.

And so, you see, the old saying in the Good Book came true after all:
""Be sure your sin will find you out."""
the-golden-blackbird,1,"Once upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons. He fell very
ill, sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but they, none of
them, could find out what was the matter with him, or even give him
any relief. At last there came a foreign doctor, who declared that the
Golden Blackbird alone could cure the sick man.

So the old lord despatched his eldest son to look for the wonderful
bird, and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bring
it back."
the-golden-blackbird,2,"The young man began his journey, and soon arrived at a place where four
roads met. He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in the
air, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him.
After travelling for two or three days, he grew tired of walking without
knowing where or for how long, and he stopped at an inn which was filled
with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink.

'My faith,' said he, 'it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting for
this bird. My father is old, and if he dies I shall inherit his goods.'"
the-golden-blackbird,3,"The old man, after waiting patiently for some time, sent his second son
to seek the Golden Blackbird. The youth took the same direction as his
brother, and when he came to the cross roads, he too tossed up which
road he should take. The cap fell in the same place as before, and he
walked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted. The
latter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him to
stay where he was and amuse himself.

'You are right,' replied the youth. 'Who knows if I should ever find the
Golden Blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it. At
the worst, if the old man dies, we shall have his property.'"
the-golden-blackbird,4,"He entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted, till
very soon their money was all spent. They even owed something to their
landlord, who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts.

The youngest son set forth in his turn, and he arrived at the place
where his brothers were still prisoners. They called to him to stop, and
did all they could to prevent his going further.

'No,' he replied, 'my father trusted me, and I will go all over the
world till I find the Golden Blackbird.'

'Bah,' said his brothers, 'you will never succeed any better than we
did. Let him die if he wants to; we will divide the property.'"
the-golden-blackbird,5,"As he went his way he met a little hare, who stopped to look at him, and
asked:

'Where are you going, my friend?'

'I really don't quite know,' answered he. 'My father is ill, and he
cannot be cured unless I bring him back the Golden Blackbird. It is a
long time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.'

'Ah,' said the hare, 'you have a long way to go yet. You will have to
walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.'

'And how am I to travel such a distance?'

'Mount on my back,' said the little hare, 'and I will conduct you.'"
the-golden-blackbird,6,"The young man obeyed: at each bound the little hare went seven miles,
and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large and
beautiful as a castle could be.

'The Golden Blackbird is in a little cabin near by,' said the little
hare, 'and you will easily find it. It lives in a little cage, with
another cage beside it made all of gold. But whatever you do, be sure
not to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle will
know that you have stolen it.'

The youth found the Golden Blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but as
stiff and rigid as if he was dead. And beside the beautiful cage was the
cage of gold.

'Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,'
thought the youth."
the-golden-blackbird,7,"The moment that Golden Bird had touched the bars of the splendid cage he
awoke, and began to whistle, so that all the servants of the castle ran
to see what was the matter, saying that he was a thief and must be put
in prison.

'No,' he answered, 'I am not a thief. If I have taken the Golden
Blackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and I have
travelled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.'

'Well,' they replied, 'we will let you go, and will even give you the
Golden Bird, if you are able to bring us the Porcelain Maiden.'"
the-golden-blackbird,8,"The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munching
wild thyme.

'What are you crying for, my friend?' asked the hare.

'It is because,' he answered, 'the castle people will not allow me to
carry off the Golden Blackbird without giving them the Porcelain Maiden
in exchange.'

'You have not followed my advice,' said the little hare. 'And you have
put the Golden Bird into the fine cage.'

'Alas! yes!'

'Don't despair! the Porcelain Maiden is a young girl, beautiful as
Venus, who dwells two hundred miles from here. Jump on my back and I
will take you there.'"
the-golden-blackbird,9,"The little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, was there in no time
at all, and he stopped on the borders of a lake.

'The Porcelain Maiden,' said the hare to the youth, 'will come here to
bathe with her friends, while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh
me. When she is in the lake, be sure you hide her clothes, which are of
dazzling whiteness, and do not give them back to her unless she consents
to follow you.'

The little hare left him, and almost immediately the Porcelain Maiden
arrived with her friends. She undressed herself and got into the water.
Then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of her clothes,
which he hid under a rock at some distance."
the-golden-blackbird,10,"When the Porcelain Maiden was tired of playing in the water she came out
to dress herself, but, though she hunted for her clothes high and low,
she could find them nowhere. Her friends helped her in the search, but,
seeing at last that it was of no use, they left her, alone on the bank,
weeping bitterly.

'Why do you cry?' said the young man, approaching her.

'Alas!' answered she, 'while I was bathing someone stole my clothes, and
my friends have abandoned me.'

'I will find your clothes if you will only come with me.'"
the-golden-blackbird,11,"And the Porcelain Maiden agreed to follow him, and after having given up
her clothes, the young man bought a small horse for her, which went like
the wind. The little hare brought them both back to seek for the Golden
Blackbird, and when they drew near to the castle where it lived the
little hero said to the young man:

'Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manage
to carry off both the Golden Blackbird and the Porcelain Maiden. Take
the golden cage in one hand, and leave the bird in the old cage where he
is, and bring that away too.'"
the-golden-blackbird,12,"The little hare then vanished; the youth did as he was bid, and the
castle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the Golden Bird.
When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained, he delivered
them by paying their debt. They set out all together, but as the two
elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest, they took
the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a lake to throw
themselves upon him, seize the Golden Bird, and fling him in the water.
Then they continued their journey, taking with them the Porcelain
Maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned. But, happily,
he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and called loudly for
help. The little hare came running to him, and said 'Take hold of my leg
and pull yourself out of the water.'"
the-golden-blackbird,13,"When he was safe on shore the little hare said to him:

'Now this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seeking a
place as stable-boy, and go and offer your services to your father. Once
there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth.'

The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to his
father's castle and enquired if they were not in want of a stable-boy.

'Yes,' replied his father, 'very much indeed. But it is not an easy
place. There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyone
go near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who have
tried to groom it.'

'I will undertake to groom it,' said the youth. 'I never saw the horse
I was afraid of yet.' The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down
without a toss of its head and without a kick.

'Good gracious!' exclaimed the master; 'how is it that he lets you touch
him, when no one else can go near him?'

'Perhaps he knows me,' answered the stable-boy."
the-golden-blackbird,14,"Two or three days later the master said to him: 'The Porcelain Maiden
is here: but, though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked that
she scratches everyone that approaches her. Try if she will accept your
services.'

When the youth entered the room where she was, the Golden Blackbird
broke forth into a joyful song, and the Porcelain Maiden sang too, and
jumped for joy.

'Good gracious!' cried the master. 'The Porcelain Maiden and the Golden
Blackbird know you too?'

'Yes,' replied the youth, 'and the Porcelain Maiden can tell you the
whole truth, if she only will.'"
the-golden-blackbird,15,"Then she told all that had happened, and how she had consented to follow
the young man who had captured the Golden Blackbird.

'Yes,' added the youth, 'I delivered my brothers, who were kept
prisoners in an inn, and, as a reward, they threw me into a lake. So I
disguised myself and came here, in order to prove the truth to you.'

So the old lord embraced his son, and promised that he should inherit
all his possessions, and he put to death the two elder ones, who had
deceived him and had tried to slay their own brother.

The young man married the Porcelain Maiden, and had a splendid
wedding-feast."
the-golden-crab,1,"Once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children. Every morning he used to go out fishing, and whatever fish he caught he sold to the King. One day, among the other fishes, he caught a golden crab. When he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish, but he kept the Crab separate because it shone so beautifully, and placed it upon a high shelf in the cupboard. Now while the old woman, his wife, was cleaning the fish, and had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible, she suddenly heard a voice, which said:

          'Let down, let down thy petticoat
           That lets thy feet be seen.'"
the-golden-crab,2,"She turned round in surprise, and then she saw the little creature, the Golden Crab.

'What! You can speak, can you, you ridiculous crab?' she said, for she was not quite pleased at the Crab's remarks. Then she took him up and placed him on a dish.

When her husband came home and they sat down to dinner, they presently heard the Crab's little voice saying, 'Give me some too.' They were all very much surprised, but they gave him something to eat. When the old man came to take away the plate which had contained the Crab's dinner, he found it full of gold, and as the same thing happened every day he soon became very fond of the Crab.

One day the Crab said to the fisherman's wife, 'Go to the King and tell him I wish to marry his younger daughter.'"
the-golden-crab,3,"The old woman went accordingly, and laid the matter before the King, who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab, but did not decline the proposal altogether, because he was a prudent monarch, and knew that the Crab was likely to be a prince in disguise. He said, therefore, to the fisherman's wife, 'Go, old woman, and tell the Crab I will give him my daughter if by to-morrow morning he can build a wall in front of my castle much higher than my tower, upon which all the flowers of the world must grow and bloom.'

The fisherman's wife went home and gave this message.

Then the Crab gave her a golden rod, and said, 'Go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the King showed you, and to-morrow morning the wall will be there.'

The old woman did so and went away again."
the-golden-crab,4,"The next morning, when the King awoke, what do you think he saw? The wall stood there before his eyes, exactly as he had bespoken it!

Then the old woman went back to the King and said to him, 'Your Majesty's orders have been fulfilled.'

'That is all very well,' said the King, 'but I cannot give away my daughter until there stands in front of my palace a garden in which there are three fountains, of which the first must play gold, the second diamonds, and the third brilliants.'

So the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod, and the next morning the garden was there. The King now gave his consent, and the wedding was fixed for the very next day."
the-golden-crab,5,"Then the Crab said to the old fisherman, 'Now take this rod; go and knock with it on a certain mountain; then a black man will come out and ask you what you wish for. Answer him thus: ' 'Your master, the King, has sent me to tell you that you must send him his golden garment that is like the sun.' ' Make him give you, besides, the queenly robes of gold and precious stones which are like the flowery meadows, and bring them both to me. And bring me also the golden cushion.'"
the-golden-crab,6,"The old man went and did his errand. When he had brought the precious robes, the Crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion, and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle, where the Crab presented the other garment to his bride. Now the ceremony took place, and when the married pair were alone together the Crab made himself known to his young wife, and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world, and how he was enchanted, so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night; and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished. No sooner had he said this than he shook himself, and immediately became a handsome youth, but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab-shell. And the same thing happened every day. But the Princess's affection for the Crab, and the polite attention with which she behaved to him, surprised the royal family very much. They suspected some secret, but though they spied and spied, they could not discover it. Thus a year passed away, and the Princess had a son, whom she called Benjamin. But her mother still thought the whole matter very strange. At last she said to the King that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the Crab? But when the daughter was questioned she only answered:

'I am married to the Crab, and him only will I have.'"
the-golden-crab,7,"Then the King said to her, 'I will appoint a tournament in your honour, and I will invite all the princes in the world to it, and if any one of them pleases you, you shall marry him.'

In the evening the Princess told this to the Crab, who said to her, 'Take this rod, go to the garden gate and knock with it, then a black man will come out and say to you, ' 'Why have you called me, and what do you require of me?' Answer him thus: 'Your master the King has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple.' ' And bring them to me.'

The Princess did so, and brought him what he desired."
the-golden-crab,8,"The following evening the Prince dressed himself for the tournament. Before he went he said to his wife, 'Now mind you do not say when you see me that I am the Crab. For if you do this evil will come of it. Place yourself at the window with your sisters; I will ride by and throw you the silver apple. Take it in your hand, but if they ask you who I am, say that you do not know.' So saying, he kissed her, repeated his warning once more, and went away.

The Princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament. Presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her. She caught it in her hand and went with it to her room, and by-and-by her husband came back to her. But her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the Princes; he therefore appointed a second tournament.

The Crab then gave his wife the same directions as before, only this time the apple which she received from the black man was of gold. But before the Prince went to the tournament he said to his wife, 'Now I know you will betray me to-day.'"
the-golden-crab,9,"But she swore to him that she would not tell who he was. He then repeated his warning and went away.

In the evening, while the Princess, with her mother and sisters, was standing at the window, the Prince suddenly galloped past on his steed and threw her the golden apple.

Then her mother flew into a passion, gave her a box on the ear, and cried out, 'Does not even that prince please you, you fool?'

The Princess in her fright exclaimed, 'That is the Crab himself!'

Her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner, ran into her daughter's room where the crab-shell was still lying, took it up and threw it into the fire. Then the poor Princess cried bitterly, but it was of no use; her husband did not come back."
the-golden-crab,10,"Now we must leave the Princess and turn to the other persons in the story. One day an old man went to a stream to dip in a crust of bread which he was going to eat, when a dog came out of the water, snatched the bread from his hand, and ran away. The old man ran after him, but the dog reached a door, pushed it open, and ran in, the old man following him. He did not overtake the dog, but found himself above a staircase, which he descended. Then he saw before him a stately palace, and, entering, he found in a large hall a table set for twelve persons. He hid himself in the hall behind a great picture, that he might see what would happen. At noon he heard a great noise, so that he trembled with fear. When he took courage to look out from behind the picture, he saw twelve eagles flying in. At this sight his fear became still greater. The eagles flew to the basin of a fountain that was there and bathed themselves, when suddenly they were changed into twelve handsome youths. Now they seated themselves at the table, and one of them took up a goblet filled with wine, and said, 'A health to my father!' And another said, 'A health to my mother!' and so the healths went round. Then one of them said:

     'A health to my dearest lady,
           Long may she live and well!
       But a curse on the cruel mother
           That burnt my golden shell!'"
the-golden-crab,11,"And so saying he wept bitterly. Then the youths rose from the table, went back to the great stone fountain, turned themselves into eagles again, and flew away.

Then the old man went away too, returned to the light of day, and went home. Soon after he heard that the Princess was ill, and that the only thing that did her good was having stories told to her. He therefore went to the royal castle, obtained an audience of the Princess, and told her about the strange things he had seen in the underground palace. No sooner had he finished than the Princess asked him whether he could find the way to that palace.

'Yes,' he answered, 'certainly.'"
the-golden-crab,12,"And now she desired him to guide her thither at once. The old man did so, and when they came to the palace he hid her behind the great picture and advised her to keep quite still, and he placed himself behind the picture also. Presently the eagles came flying in, and changed themselves into young men, and in a moment the Princess recognised her husband amongst them all, and tried to come out of her hiding-place; but the old man held her back. The youths seated themselves at the table; and now the Prince said again, while he took up the cup of wine:

     'A health to my dearest lady,
           Long may she live and well!
       But a curse on the cruel mother
           That burnt my golden shell!'"
the-golden-crab,13,"Then the Princess could restrain herself no longer, but ran forward and threw her arms round her husband. And immediately he knew her again, and said:

'Do you remember how I told you that day that you would betray me? Now you see that I spoke the truth. But all that bad time is past. Now listen to me: I must still remain enchanted for three months. Will you stay here with me till that time is over?'"
the-golden-crab,14,"So the Princess stayed with him, and said to the old man, 'Go back to the castle and tell my parents that I am staying here.'

Her parents were very much vexed when the old man came back and told them this, but as soon as the three months of the Prince's enchantment were over, he ceased to be an eagle and became once more a man, and they returned home together. And then they lived happily, and we who hear the story are happier still."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,1,"In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad
named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing
or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listen eagerly
to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table.

In those days there lived on St. Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a huge
giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savage
looks were the terror of all who beheld him."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,2,"He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used to wade
over to the mainland in search of prey; when he would throw half a dozen
oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his
waist, and march back to his own abode.

The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy
him."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,3,"Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern,
and one winter's evening he went to the mount. There he dug a pit
twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad. He covered the top over so as to
make it look like solid ground. He then blew his horn so loudly that the
giant awoke and came out of his den crying out: ""You saucy villain! you
shall pay for this I'll broil you for my breakfast!""

He had just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong
into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe
which killed him. Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the
news."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,4,"Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever
he should have him in his power. This giant kept an enchanted castle in
the midst of a lonely wood; and some time after the death of Cormoran
Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary, sat down and went to
sleep.

The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where
he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with
the bodies, skulls and bones of men and women."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,5,"Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant,
to take a meal off his flesh; and Jack saw with terror through the bars
of his prison the two giants approaching.

Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage,
and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and
tied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them. When
they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to
the heart."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,6,"Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore,
and went into the castle again. He made a strict search through all
the rooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair
of their heads, and almost starved to death. They told him that their
husbands had been killed by the giants, who had then condemned them to
be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own
dead husbands.

""Ladies,"" said Jack, ""I have put an end to the monster and his wicked
brother; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to
make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt."" He then very
politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on his
journey to Wales."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,7,"As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible. At length
he came to a handsome house. Jack knocked at the door, when there came
forth a Welsh giant. Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way,
on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there
was a good bed to sleep in.

Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not
go to sleep. Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and
forward in the next room, and saying to himself:

  ""Though here you lodge with me this night,
  You shall not see the morning light;
  My club shall dash your brains out quite."""
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,8,"""Say you so?"" thought Jack. ""Are these your tricks upon travelers? But
I hope to prove as cunning as you are."" Then, getting out of bed, he
groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood.
He laid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a dark
corner of the room.

The giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeon
struck many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid the
log; and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken all
Jack's bones."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,9,"Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter, and walked
into the giant's room to thank him for his lodging. The giant started
when he saw him, and began to stammer out: ""Oh! dear me; is it you? Pray
how did you sleep last night? Did you hear or see anything in the dead
of the night?""

""Nothing to speak of,"" said Jack, carelessly; ""a rat, I believe, gave me
three or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little; but I soon
went to sleep again."""
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,10,"The giant wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a word,
but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast.
Jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as
himself, so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and
slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put it into his
mouth.

When breakfast was over he said to the giant: ""Now I will show you a
fine trick. I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off my head
in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders. You
shall see an example."" He then took hold of the knife, ripped up the
leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,11,"""Ods splutter hur nails!"" cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be
outdone by such a little fellow as Jack, ""hur can do that hurself"";
so he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a
moment dropped down dead.

Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolved
not to be idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse,
a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an
invisible coat, the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay
before him."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,12,"He traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a large and
spacious forest through which his road lay. Scarcely had he entered the
forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair
of their heads a handsome knight and his lady. Jack alighted from his
horse, and tying him to an oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under
which he carried his sword of sharpness.

When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but could
not reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and at
length, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might,
he cut off both his legs. Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck,
plunged his sword into the giant's body, when the monster gave a groan
and expired."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,13,"The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invited
him to their house, to receive a proper reward for his services. ""No,""
 said Jack, ""I cannot be easy till I find out this monster's habitation.""
 So, taking the knight's directions, he mounted his horse and soon after
came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber
waiting for his brother's return.

Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat,
approached and aimed a blow at the giant's head, but, missing his aim,
he only cut off his nose. On this the giant seized his club and laid
about him most unmercifully."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,14,"""Nay,"" said Jack, ""if this be the case I'd better dispatch you!"" so,
jumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he dropped down
dead.

Jack then proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dales,
till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a
lonely house, when an old man let him in.

When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him: ""My son, on the top
of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus
and a vile magician. I lament the fate of a duke's daughter, whom they
seized as she was walking in her father's garden, and brought hither
transformed into a deer."""
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,15,"Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he would
break the enchantment; and after a sound sleep he rose early, put on his
invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt.

When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery
griffins, but he passed between them without the least fear of danger,
for they could not see him because of his invisible coat. On the castle
gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written these lines:

  ""Whoever can this trumpet blow
  Shall cause the giant's overthrow."""
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,16,"As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill
blast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble.

The giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an
end, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear. Jack,
with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was
then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautiful lady
who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper
shapes. The castle vanished away like smoke, and the head of the giant
Galligantus was then sent to King Arthur."
the-history-of-jack-the-giant-killer,17,"The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man's hermitage, and
next day they set out for the Court. Jack then went up to the King, and
gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles.

Jack's fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King's
desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all his
kingdom. After this the King gave him a large estate, on which he and
his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.(1)"
the-iron-stove,1,"Once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king's son who was enchanted by an old witch, so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood. There he lived for many years, and no one could free him. At last a king's daughter came into the wood; she had lost her way, and could not find her father's kingdom again. She had been wandering round and round for nine days, and she came at last to the iron case. A voice came from within and asked her, 'Where do you come from, and where do you want to go?' She answered, 'I have lost my way to my father's kingdom, and I shall never get home again.' Then the voice from the iron stove said, 'I will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time, if you will promise to do what I ask you. I am a greater prince than you are a princess, and I will marry you.' Then she grew frightened, and thought, 'What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?' But as she wanted very much to go home to her father, she promised to do what he wished.

He said, 'You must come again, and bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron.'"
the-iron-stove,2,"Then he gave her someone for a guide, who walked near her and said nothing, but he brought her in two hours to her house. There was great joy in the castle when the Princess came back, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. But she was very much troubled, and said, 'Dear father, listen to what has befallen me! I should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that I will go back to free him and marry him!' The old King was so frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter. So they consulted together, and determined that the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful, should take her place. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove. She scraped for twenty-four hours, but did not make the least impression. When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove, 'It seems to me that it is day outside.' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me; I think I hear my father's mill rattling.'

'So you are a miller's daughter! Then go away at once, and tell the King's daughter to come.'"
the-iron-stove,3,"Then she went away, and told the old King that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her, but wanted the Princess. The old King was frightened, and his daughter wept. But they had a swineherd's daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller's daughter, and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the Princess. Then she was taken out, and had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no impression. As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out, 'It seems to be daylight outside.' Then she answered, 'It seems so to me too; I think I hear my father blowing his horn.' 'So you are a swineherd's daughter! Go away at once, and let the King's daughter come. And say to her that what I foretell shall come to pass, and if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin, and not one stone shall be left upon another.'"
the-iron-stove,4,"When the Princess heard this she began to cry, but it was no good; she had to keep her word. She took leave of her father, put a knife in her belt, and went to the iron stove in the wood. As soon as she reached it she began to scrape, and the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole. Then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot. So she scraped away harder than ever, and made the hole so large that he could get out. Then he said, 'You are mine, and I am thine; you are my bride and have set me free!'"
the-iron-stove,5,"He wanted to take her with him to his kingdom, but she begged him just to let her go once more to her father; and the Prince let her go, but told her not to say more than three words to her father, then to come back again. So she went home, but alas! she said MORE THAN THREE WORDS; and immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a mountain of glass and sharp swords. But the Prince was free, and was no longer shut up in it. Then she said good-bye to her father, and took a little money with her, and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove; but she could not find it. She sought it for nine days, and then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer. And when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come, because she was afraid of the wild beasts."
the-iron-stove,6,"When midnight came she saw afar off a little light, and thought, 'Ah! if only I could reach that!' Then she got down from the tree and went towards the light. She came to a little old house with a great deal of grass growing round, and stood in front of a little heap of wood. She thought, 'Alas! what am I coming to?' and peeped through the window; but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the dishes and drinking-cups were of silver. Then she took heart and knocked. Then a fat toad called out:

          'Little green toad with leg like crook,
           Open wide the door, and look
           Who it was the latch that shook.'"
the-iron-stove,7,"And a little toad came forward and let her in. When she entered they all bid her welcome, and made her sit down. They asked her how she came there and what she wanted. Then she told everything that had happened to her, and how, because she had exceeded her permission only to speak three words, the stove had disappeared with the Prince; and how she had searched a very long time, and must wander over mountain and valley till she found him.

Then the old toad said:

          'Little green toad whose leg doth twist,
           Go to the corner of which you wist,
           And bring to me the large old kist.'"
the-iron-stove,8,"And the little toad went and brought out a great chest. Then they gave her food and drink, and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite, on which she lay down and slept soundly. When the day dawned she arose, and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her. She would have need of them, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting swords, and a great lake. When she had passed these she would find her lover again. So she was given three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts, which she was to take great care of. She set out with these things, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind her feet and then in front, and so got over it, and when she was on the other side put them carefully away."
the-iron-stove,9,"Then she reached the three cutting swords, and got on her plough-wheel and rolled over them. At last she came to a great lake, and, when she had crossed that, arrived at a beautiful castle. She went in and gave herself out as a servant, a poor maid who would gladly be engaged. But she knew that the Prince whom she had freed from the iron stove in the great wood was in the castle. So she was taken on as a kitchen-maid for very small wages. Now the Prince was about to marry another princess, for he thought she was dead long ago."
the-iron-stove,10,"In the evening, when she had washed up and was ready, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one and was going to eat the kernel, when behold! there was a beautiful royal dress inside it! When the bride heard of this, she came and begged for the dress, and wanted to buy it, saying that it was not a dress for a serving-maid. Then she said she would not sell it unless she was granted one favour-namely, to sleep by the Prince's door. The bride granted her this, because the dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, 'That stupid maid wants to sleep by your door.'"
the-iron-stove,11,"'If you are contented, I am,' he said. But she gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. Then they both went to his room, but he slept so soundly that she could not wake him. The maid wept all night long, and said, 'I freed you in the wild wood out of the iron stove; I have sought you, and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found you, and will you not hear me now?' The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and they told their master in the morning."
the-iron-stove,12,"When she had washed up the next evening she bit the second nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside. When the bride saw it she wanted to buy it also. But the maid did not want money, and asked that she should sleep again by the Prince's door. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he slept so soundly that he heard nothing. But the kitchen-maid wept the whole night long, and said, 'I have freed you in a wood and from an iron stove; I sought you and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake to find you, and now you will not hear me!' The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and in the morning they told their master."
the-iron-stove,13,"And when she had washed up on the third night she bit the third nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside that was made of pure gold. When the bride saw it she wanted to have it, but the maid would only give it her on condition that she should sleep for the third time by the Prince's door. But the Prince took care not to drink the sleeping-draught. When she began to weep and to say, 'Dearest sweetheart, I freed you in the horrible wild wood, and from an iron stove,' he jumped up and said, 'You are right. You are mine, and I am thine.' Though it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took the false bride's clothes away, so that she could not follow them. When they came to the great lake they rowed across, and when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on the plough-wheel, and on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in. So they arrived at last at the little old house, but when they stepped inside it turned into a large castle. The toads were all freed, and were beautiful King's children, running about for joy. There they were married, and they remained in the castle, which was much larger than that of the Princess's father's. But because the old man did not like being left alone, they went and fetched him. So they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth.

          A mouse has run,
           My story's done."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,1,"The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country. He was old and monstrous big; he was wise and friendly to all who knew him. His body was thickly covered with long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun. His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed.

The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; but the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour.

Often his subjects, the polar bears, came to him for advice when ill or in trouble; but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds, lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,2,"The wolves, who sometimes came as far north as the icebergs, whispered among themselves that the King of the Polar Bears was either a magician or under the protection of a powerful fairy. For no earthly thing seemed able to harm him; he never failed to secure plenty of food, and he grew bigger and stronger day by day and year by year.

Yet the time came when this monarch of the north met man, and his wisdom failed him.

He came out of his cave among the icebergs one day and saw a boat moving through the strip of water which had been uncovered by the shifting of the summer ice. In the boat were men."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,3,"The great bear had never seen such creatures before, and therefore advanced toward the boat, sniffing the strange scent with aroused curiosity and wondering whether he might take them for friends or foes, food or carrion.

When the king came near the water's edge a man stood up in the boat and with a queer instrument made a loud ""bang!"" The polar bear felt a shock; his brain became numb; his thoughts deserted him; his great limbs shook and gave way beneath him and his body fell heavily upon the hard ice.

That was all he remembered for a time."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,4,"When he awoke he was smarting with pain on every inch of his huge bulk, for the men had cut away his hide with its glorious white hair and carried it with them to a distant ship.

Above him circled thousands of his friends the gulls, wondering if their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him. But when they saw him raise his head and groan and tremble they knew he still lived, and one of them said to his comrades:

""The wolves were right. The king is a great magician, for even men cannot kill him. But he suffers for lack of covering. Let us repay his kindness to us by each giving him as many feathers as we can spare."""
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,5,"This idea pleased the gulls. One after another they plucked with their beaks the softest feathers from under their wings, and, flying down, dropped then gently upon the body of the King of the Polar Bears.

Then they called to him in a chorus:

""Courage, friend! Our feathers are as soft and beautiful as your own shaggy hair. They will guard you from the cold winds and warm you while you sleep. Have courage, then, and live!"""
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,6,"And the King of the Polar Bears had courage to bear his pain and lived and was strong again.

The feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and covered him as his own hair had done. Mostly they were pure white in color, but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight mottled appearance.

The rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food. He felt no shame at his feathery covering, but it was still strange to him, and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,7,"During this period of retirement he thought much of the men who had harmed him, and remembered the way they had made the great ""bang!"" And he decided it was best to keep away from such fierce creatures. Thus he added to his store of wisdom.

When the moon fell away from the sky and the sun came to make the icebergs glitter with the gorgeous tintings of the rainbow, two of the polar bears arrived at the king's cavern to ask his advice about the hunting season. But when they saw his great body covered with feathers instead of hair they began to laugh, and one said:

""Our mighty king has become a bird! Who ever before heard of a feathered polar bear?"""
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,8,"Then the king gave way to wrath. He advanced upon them with deep growls and stately tread and with one blow of his monstrous paw stretched the mocker lifeless at his feet.

The other ran away to his fellows and carried the news of the king's strange appearance. The result was a meeting of all the polar bears upon a broad field of ice, where they talked gravely of the remarkable change that had come upon their monarch."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,9,"""He is, in reality, no longer a bear,"" said one; ""nor can he justly be called a bird. But he is half bird and half bear, and so unfitted to remain our king.""

""Then who shall take his place?"" asked another.

""He who can fight the bird-bear and overcome him,"" answered an aged member of the group. ""Only the strongest is fit to rule our race.""

There was silence for a time, but at length a great bear moved to the front and said:

""I will fight him; I-Woof-the strongest of our race! And I will be King of the Polar Bears."""
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,10,"The others nodded assent, and dispatched a messenger to the king to say he must fight the great Woof and master him or resign his sovereignty.

""For a bear with feathers,"" added the messenger, ""is no bear at all, and the king we obey must resemble the rest of us.""

""I wear feathers because it pleases me,"" growled the king. ""Am I not a great magician? But I will fight, nevertheless, and if Woof masters me he shall be king in my stead.""

Then he visited his friends, the gulls, who were even then feasting upon the dead bear, and told them of the coming battle.

""I shall conquer,"" he said, proudly. ""Yet my people are in the right, for only a hairy one like themselves can hope to command their obedience."""
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,11,"The queen gull said:

""I met an eagle yesterday, which had made its escape from a big city of men. And the eagle told me he had seen a monstrous polar bear skin thrown over the back of a carriage that rolled along the street. That skin must have been yours, oh king, and if you wish I will sent an hundred of my gulls to the city to bring it back to you.""

""Let them go!"" said the king, gruffly. And the hundred gulls were soon flying rapidly southward."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,12,"For three days they flew straight as an arrow, until they came to scattered houses, to villages, and to cities. Then their search began.

The gulls were brave, and cunning, and wise. Upon the fourth day they reached the great metropolis, and hovered over the streets until a carriage rolled along with a great white bear robe thrown over the back seat. Then the birds swooped down-the whole hundred of them-and seizing the skin in their beaks flew quickly away.

They were late. The king's great battle was upon the seventh day, and they must fly swiftly to reach the Polar regions by that time."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,13,"Meanwhile the bird-bear was preparing for his fight. He sharpened his claws in the small crevasses of the ice. He caught a seal and tested his big yellow teeth by crunching its bones between them. And the queen gull set her band to pluming the king bear's feathers until they lay smoothly upon his body.

But every day they cast anxious glances into the southern sky, watching for the hundred gulls to bring back the king's own skin.

The seventh day came, and all the Polar bears in that region gathered around the king's cavern. Among them was Woof, strong and confident of his success."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,14,"""The bird-bear's feathers will fly fast enough when I get my claws upon him!"" he boasted; and the others laughed and encouraged him.

The king was disappointed at not having recovered his skin, but he resolved to fight bravely without it. He advanced from the opening of his cavern with a proud and kingly bearing, and when he faced his enemy he gave so terrible a growl that Woof's heart stopped beating for a moment, and he began to realize that a fight with the wise and mighty king of his race was no laughing matter."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,15,"After exchanging one or two heavy blows with his foe Woof's courage returned, and he determined to dishearten his adversary by bluster.

""Come nearer, bird-bear!"" he cried. ""Come nearer, that I may pluck your plumage!""

The defiance filled the king with rage. He ruffled his feathers as a bird does, till he appeared to be twice his actual size, and then he strode forward and struck Woof so powerful a blow that his skull crackled like an egg-shell and he fell prone upon the ground."
the-king-of-the-polar-bears,16,"While the assembled bears stood looking with fear and wonder at their fallen champion the sky became darkened.

An hundred gulls flew down from above and dripped upon the king's body a skin covered with pure white hair that glittered in the sun like silver.

And behold! the bears saw before them the well-known form of their wise and respected master, and with one accord they bowed their shaggy heads in homage to the mighty King of the Polar Bears."
the-little-hunting-dog,1,"Once upon a time, in the city of Shansi, there lived a scholar whofound the company of others too noisy for him. So he made his home ina Buddhist temple. Yet he suffered because there were always so manygnats and fleas in his room that he could not sleep at night."
the-little-hunting-dog,2,"Once he was resting on his bed after dinner, when suddenly two littleknights with plumes in their helmets rode into the room. They mighthave been two inches high, and rode horses about the size ofgrasshoppers. On their gauntleted hands they held hunting falcons aslarge as flies. They rode about the room with great rapidity. Thescholar had no more than set eyes on them when a third entered, cladlike the others, but carrying a bow and arrows and leading a littlehunting dog the size of an ant with him."
the-little-hunting-dog,3,"After him came a great throngof footmen and horsemen, several hundred in all. And they had huntingfalcons and hunting dogs by the hundred, too. Then the fleas and gnatsbegan to rise in the air; but were all slain by the falcons. And thehunting dogs climbed on the bed, and sniffed along the walls trailingthe fleas, and ate them up. They followed the trace of whatever hid inthe cracks, and nosed it out, so that in a short space of time theyhad killed nearly all the vermin."
the-little-hunting-dog,4,"The scholar pretended to be asleep and watched them. And the falconssettled down on him, and the dogs crawled along his body. Shortlyafter came a man clad in yellow, wearing a king's crown, who climbedon an empty couch and seated himself there. And at once all thehorsemen rode up, descended from their horses and brought him all thebirds and game. They then gathered beside him in a great throng, andconversed with him in a strange tongue."
the-little-hunting-dog,5,"Not long after the king got into a small chariot and his bodyguardssaddled their horses with the greatest rapidity. Then they gallopedout with great cries of homage, till it looked as though some one werescattering beans and a heavy cloud of dust rose behind them."
the-little-hunting-dog,6,"They had nearly all of them disappeared, while the scholar's eyeswere still fixed on them full of terror and astonishment, and he couldnot imagine whence they had come. He slipped on his shoes and looked;but they had vanished without a trace. Then he returned and looked allabout his room; but there was nothing to be seen. Only, on a brickagainst the wall, they had forgotten a little hunting dog. The scholarquickly caught it and found it quite tame. He put it in his paint-boxand examined it closely. It had a very smooth, fine coat, and wore alittle collar around its neck."
the-little-hunting-dog,7,"He tried to feed it a few bread-crumbs,but the little dog only sniffed at them and let them lie. Then itleaped into the bed and hunted up some nits and gnats in the folds ofthe linen, which it devoured. Then it returned and lay down. When thenight had passed the scholar feared it might have run away; but thereit lay, curled up as before. Whenever the scholar went to bed, the dogclimbed into it and bit to death any vermin it could find. Not a flyor gnat dared alight while it was around. The scholar loved it like ajewel of price."
the-little-hunting-dog,8,"But once he took a nap in the daytime, and the little dog crawled intobed beside him. The scholar woke and turned around, supporting himselfon his side. As he did so he felt something, and feared it might behis little dog. He quickly rose and looked, but it was alreadydead--pressed flat, as though cut out of paper!But at any rate none of the vermin had survived it."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,1,"In a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore, alone with his
sister, lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature. Many
large rocks were scattered around their habitation, and it had a very
wild and out-of-the-way look.

The boy grew no larger as he advanced in years. Yet, small as he
was, he had a big spirit of his own, and loved dearly to play the master
in the lodge. One day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to
play with. He meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear
ice. When she handed him the ball, his sister cautioned him not to go
too far.

He laughed at her, and ran off in high glee, throwing his ball before
him and running after it at full speed. He went as fast as his ball.
At last his ball flew to a great distance. He followed as fast as he
could. After he had run forward for some time, he saw what seemed four
dark spots upon the ice, straight before him."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,2,"When he came up to the shore he was surprised to see four large, tall
men, lying on the ice, spearing fish. They were four brothers, who
looked exactly alike. As the little boy-man approached them, the nearest
looked up. In his turn he was surprised to see such a tiny being.
Turning to his brothers, he said:

""Tia! look! see what a little fellow is here.""

The three others then looked up too. Seeing these four faces,
as if they had been one, the little spirit or boy-man said to himself:

""Four in one! What a time they must have in choosing their
hunting-shirts!""

After they had all stared for a moment at the boy, they covered their
heads, intent in searching for fish. The boy thought to himself:

""These four-faces fancy that I am to be put off without notice because I
am so little. They are so broad and long. They shall find out. I may
find a way to teach them that I am not to be treated so lightly."""
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,3,"After they were covered up, the boy-man, looking sharply about, saw that
among them they had caught one large trout, which was lying just by
their side. Stealing along, he slyly seized it. Placing his fingers
in the gills, and tossing his ball before him, he ran off at full speed.

They heard the pattering of his little steps upon the ice. When the
four looked up all together, they saw their fine trout sliding away, as
if of itself, at a great rate, the boy being so small that he could not
be distinguished from the fish.

""See!"" they cried out, ""our fish is running away on the dry land!""

When they stood up they could just see, over the fish's head, that it
was the boy-man who was carrying it off.

The little spirit reached the lodge, and having left the trout at the
door, he told his sister to go out and bring in the fish he had brought
home.

She exclaimed, ""Where could you have got it? I hope you have not stolen
it."""
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,4,"""Oh,"" he replied, ""I found it on the ice. It was caught in our lake.
Have we no right to a little lake of our own? I shall claim all the fish
that come out of its waters.""

""How,"" the sister asked again, ""could you have got it there?""

""No matter,"" said the boy; ""go and cook it.""

It was as much as the girl could do to drag the great trout within
doors. She cooked it, and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no
more questions as to how he had come by it.

The next morning the little spirit or boy-man set off as he had the day
before.

He made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along. High
over his head he would toss it, straight up into the air; then far
before him. And again, in mere merriment of spirit, he would send it
bounding back, as if he had plenty of speed and enough to spare in
running back after it. The ball leaped and bounded about, and glided
through the air as if it were a live thing, and enjoyed the sport as
much as the boy-man himself."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,5,"When he came within hail of the four large men, who were fishing there
every day, he cast his ball with such force that it rolled into the
ice-hole about which they were busy. The boy, standing on the shore of
the lake, called out:

""Four-in-one, pray hand me my ball.""

""No, indeed,"" they answered, setting up a grim laugh which curdled their
four dark faces all at once, ""we shall not."" With their
fishing-spears they thrust the ball under the ice.

""Good!"" said the boy-man, ""we shall see.""

Saying which he rushed upon the four brothers and thrust them at one
push into the water. His ball bounded back to the surface, and, picking
it up, he ran off, tossing it before him in his own sportive way.
Outstripping it in speed he soon reached home, and remained within till
the next morning.

The four brothers, rising up from the water at the same time, dripping
and angry, roared out in one voice a terrible threat of vengeance, which
they promised to execute the next day. They knew the boy's speed, and
that they could by no means overtake him.

By times in the morning, the four brothers were stirring in their lodge,
and getting ready to look after their revenge.

Their old mother, who lived with them, begged them not to go."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,6,"""Better,"" said she, ""now that your clothes are dry, to think no more of
the ducking than to go and all four of you get your heads broken, as you
surely will. That boy is a monedo or he could not perform such feats
as he does.""

But her sons paid no heed to this wise advice. Raising a great
war-cry, which frightened the birds overhead nearly out of their
feathers, they started for the boy's lodge among the rocks.

The little spirit or boy-man heard them roaring forth their threats as
they approached, but he did not appear to be disquieted in the least.
His sister as yet had heard nothing. After a while she thought she could
distinguish the noise of snow-shoes on the snow, at a distance, but
rapidly advancing. She looked out, and seeing the four large men coming
straight to their lodge she was in great fear, and running in,
exclaimed:

""He is coming, four times as strong as ever!"" for she supposed that the
one man whom her brother had offended had become so angry as to make
four of himself in order to wreak his vengeance."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,7,"The boy-man said, ""Why do you mind them? Give me something to eat.""

""How can you think of eating at such a time?"" she replied.

""Do as I request you, and be quick.""

She then gave little spirit his dish, and he commenced eating.

Just then the brothers came to the door.

""See!"" cried the sister, ""the man with four heads!""

The brothers were about to lift the curtain at the door, when the
boy-man turned his dish upside down. Immediately the door was closed
with a stone, upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with
their clubs with great fury. At length they succeeded in making a
slight opening. One of the brothers presented his face at this little
window, and rolled his eye about at the boy-man in a very threatening
way.

The little spirit, who, when he had closed the door, had returned to his
meal, which he was quietly eating, took up his bow and arrow which lay
by his side, He let fly the shaft, which, striking the man in the head,
he fell back. The boy-man merely called out ""Number one"" as he fell, and
went on with his meal."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,8,"In a moment a second face, just like the first, presented itself. As he raised his bow, his sister said to him:

""What is the use? You have killed that man already.""

Little spirit fired his arrow--the man fell--he called out ""Number two,""
and continued his meal.

The two others of the four brothers were dispatched in the same quiet
way, and counted off as ""Number three"" and ""Number four.""

After they were all well disposed of in this way, the boy-man directed
his sister to go out and see them. She presently ran back, saying:

""There are four of them.""

""Of course,"" the boy-man answered, ""and there always shall be four of
them.""

Going out himself, the boy-man raised the brothers to their feet, and
giving each a push, one with his face to the East, another to the West,
a third to the South, and the last to the North, he sent them off to
wander about the earth. Whenever you see four men just alike, they
are the four brothers whom the little spirit or boy-man dispatched upon
their travels.

But this was not the last display of the boy-man's power.

When spring came on, and the lake began to sparkle in the morning sun,
the boy-man said to his sister:

""Make me a new set of arrows, and a bow."""
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,9,"Although he provided for their support, the little spirit never
performed household or hard work of any kind, and his sister obeyed.

When she had made the weapons, which, though they were very small, were
beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could
furnish, she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake.

""She thinks,"" said the boy-man to himself, ""I can see no further into
the water than she. My sister shall learn better.""

Regardless of her warnings, he on purpose discharged a shaft into the
lake. He waded out into the water till he got into its depth, and paddled
about for his arrow, so as to call the attention of his sister, and as
if to show that he hardily braved her advice.

She hurried to the shore, calling on him to return. But instead of
heeding her, he cried out:

""You of the red fins, come and swallow me!""

Although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was
addressing, she too called out:

""Don't mind the foolish boy!""

The boy-man's order seemed to be best attended to, for immediately a
monstrous fish came and swallowed him. Before disappearing entirely,
catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore, the
boy-man hallooed out to her:

""Me-zush-ke-zin-ance!""

She wondered what he meant. At last it occurred to her that it must be
an old moccasin. She accordingly ran to the lodge, and bringing one, she
tied it to a string attached to a tree, and cast it into the water."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,10,"The great fish said to the boy-man under water.

""What is that floating?""

To which the boy-man replied:

""Go, take hold of it, swallow it as fast as you can. It is a great
delicacy.""

The fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it, making of it a
mere mouthful.

The boy-man laughed in himself, but said nothing, till the fish was
fairly caught, when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself
in his fish-carriage ashore.

The sister, who was watching all this time, opened wide her eyes as the
huge fish came up and up upon the shore. She opened them still more
when the fish seemed to speak. She heard from within a voice,
saying, ""Make haste and release me from this nasty place.""

It was her brother's voice, which she was accustomed to obey. She
made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish, from
which the boy-man presently leaped forth. He lost no time in ordering
her to cut it up and dry it, telling her that their spring supply of
meat was now provided."
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,11,"The sister now began to believe that her brother was an extraordinary
boy. Yet she was not altogether satisfied in her mind that he was
greater than the rest of the world.

They sat, one evening, in the lodge, musing with each other in the dark,
by the light of each other's eyes--for they had no other of any
kind--when the sister said, ""My brother, it is strange that you, who can
do so much, are no wiser than the Ko-ko, who gets all his light from the
moon; which shines or not, as it pleases.""

""And is not that light enough?"" asked the little spirit.

""Quite enough,"" the sister replied. ""If it would but come within the
lodge and not sojourn out in the tree-tops and among the clouds.""

""We will have a light of our own, sister,"" said the boy-man. Casting himself upon a mat by the door, he commenced singing:"
the-little-spirit-or-boy-man,12,"Fire-fly, fire-fly, bright little thing,
    Light me to bed and my song I will sing.
    Give me your light, as you fly o'er my head,
    That I may merrily go to my bed.

    Give me your light o'er the grass as you creep,
    That I may joyfully go to my sleep.
    Come, little fire-fly, come little beast,
    Come! and I'll make you to-morrow a feast.

    Come, little candle, that flies as I sing,
    Bright little fairy-bug, night's little king.
    Come and I'll dream as you guide me along.
    Come and I'll pay you, my bug, with a song.

As the boy-man chanted this call, they came in at first one by one, then
in couples, till at last, swarming in little armies, the fire-flies lit
up the little lodge with a thousand sparkling lamps, just as the stars
were lighting the mighty hollow of the sky without.

The faces of the sister and brother shone upon each other, from their
opposite sides of the lodge, with a kindly gleam of mutual trustfulness.
Never more from that hour did a doubt of each other darken their
little household."
the-magic-bon-bons,1,"There lived in Boston a wise and ancient chemist by the name of Dr. Daws, who dabbled somewhat in magic. There also lived in Boston a young lady by the name of Claribel Sudds, who was possessed of much money, little wit and an intense desire to go upon the stage.So Claribel went to Dr. Daws and said:""I can neither sing nor dance; I cannot recite verse nor play upon the piano; I am no acrobat nor leaper nor high kicker; yet I wish to go upon the stage. What shall I do?""""Are you willing to pay for such accomplishments?"" asked the wise chemist.""Certainly,"" answered Claribel, jingling her purse.""Then come to me to-morrow at two o'clock,"" said he."
the-magic-bon-bons,2,"All that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery; so that when Claribel Sudds came next day at two o'clock he showed her a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled French bonbons.""This is a progressive age,"" said the old man, ""and I flatter myself your Uncle Daws keeps right along with the procession. Now, one of your old-fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty, bitter pills to swallow; but I have consulted your taste and convenience. Here are some magic bonbons. If you eat this one with the lavender color you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you had been trained a lifetime. After you consume the pink confection you will sing like a nightingale. Eating the white one will enable you to become the finest elocutionist in the land. The chocolate piece will charm you into playing the piano better than Rubenstein, while after eating you lemon-yellow bonbon you can easily kick six feet above your head."""
the-magic-bon-bons,3,"""How delightful!"" exclaimed Claribel, who was truly enraptured. ""You are certainly a most clever sorcerer as well as a considerate compounder,"" and she held out her hand for the box.""Ahem!"" said the wise one; ""a check, please.""""Oh, yes; to be sure! How stupid of me to forget it,"" she returned.He considerately retained the box in his own hand while she signed a check for a large amount of money, after which he allowed her to hold the box herself.""Are you sure you have made them strong enough?"" she inquired, anxiously; ""it usually takes a great deal to affect me.""""My only fear,"" replied Dr. Daws, ""is that I have made them too strong. For this is the first time I have ever been called upon to prepare these wonderful confections.""""Don't worry,"" said Claribel; ""the stronger they act the better I shall act myself."""
the-magic-bon-bons,4,"She went away, after saying this, but stopping in at a dry goods store to shop, she forgot the precious box in her new interest and left it lying on the ribbon counter.Then little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon and laid her parcels beside the box. When she went away she gathered up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it.Bessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many. Then she opened it and exclaimed:""Why, it's a box of candy! Someone must have mislaid it. But it is too small a matter to worry about; there are only a few pieces."" So she dumped the contents of the box into a bonbon dish that stood upon the hall table and picking out the chocolate piece-she was fond of chocolates-ate it daintily while she examined her purchases."
the-magic-bon-bons,5,"These were not many, for Bessie was only twelve years old and was not yet trusted by her parents to expend much money at the stores. But while she tried on the hair ribbon she suddenly felt a great desire to play upon the piano, and the desire at last became so overpowering that she went into the parlor and opened the instrument.The little girl had, with infinite pains, contrived to learn two ""pieces"" which she usually executed with a jerky movement of her right hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords. But under the influence of the chocolate bonbon she sat down and ran her fingers lightly over the keys producing such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own performance.That was the prelude, however. The next moment she dashed into Beethoven's seventh sonata and played it magnificently."
the-magic-bon-bons,6,"Her mother, hearing the unusual burst of melody, came downstairs to see what musical guest had arrived; but when she discovered it was her own little daughter who was playing so divinely she had an attack of palpitation of the heart (to which she was subject) and sat down upon a sofa until it should pass away.Meanwhile Bessie played one piece after another with untiring energy. She loved music, and now found that all she need do was to sit at the piano and listen and watch her hands twinkle over the keyboard.Twilight deepened in the room and Bessie's father came home and hung up his hat and overcoat and placed his umbrella in the rack. Then he peeped into the parlor to see who was playing."
the-magic-bon-bons,7,"""Great Caesar!"" he exclaimed. But the mother came to him softly with her finger on her lips and whispered: ""Don't interrupt her, John. Our child seems to be in a trance. Did you ever hear such superb music?""""Why, she's an infant prodigy!"" gasped the astounded father. ""Beats Blind Tom all hollow! It's-it's wonderful!""As they stood listening the senator arrived, having been invited to dine with them that evening. And before he had taken off his coat the Yale professor-a man of deep learning and scholarly attainments-joined the party."
the-magic-bon-bons,8,"Bessie played on; and the four elders stood in a huddled but silent and amazed group, listening to the music and waiting for the sound of the dinner gong.Mr. Bostwick, who was hungry, picked up the bonbon dish that lay on the table beside him and ate the pink confection. The professor was watching him, so Mr. Bostwick courteously held the dish toward him. The professor ate the lemon-yellow piece and the senator reached out his hand and took the lavender piece. He did not eat it, however, for, chancing to remember that it might spoil his dinner, he put it in his vest pocket. Mrs. Bostwick, still intently listening to her precocious daughter, without thinking what she did, took the remaining piece, which was the white one, and slowly devoured it."
the-magic-bon-bons,9,"The dish was now empty, and Claribel Sudds' precious bonbons had passed from her possession forever!Suddenly Mr. Bostwick, who was a big man, began to sing in a shrill, tremolo soprano voice. It was not the same song Bessie was playing, and the discord was shocking that the professor smiled, the senator put his hands to his ears and Mrs. Bostwick cried in a horrified voice:""William!"""
the-magic-bon-bons,10,"Her husband continued to sing as if endeavoring to emulate the famous Christine Nillson, and paid no attention whatever to his wife or his guests.Fortunately the dinner gong now sounded, and Mrs. Bostwick dragged Bessie from the piano and ushered her guests into the dining-room. Mr. Bostwick followed, singing ""The Last Rose of Summer"" as if it had been an encore demanded by a thousand delighted hearers.The poor woman was in despair at witnessing her husband's undignified actions and wondered what she might do to control him. The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's face wore an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she still wanted to play the piano."
the-magic-bon-bons,11,"Mrs. Bostwick managed to get them all seated, although her husband had broken into another aria; and then the maid brought in the soup.When she carried a plate to the professor, he cried, in an excited voice:""Hold it higher! Higher-I say!"" And springing up he gave it a sudden kick that sent it nearly to the ceiling, from whence the dish descended to scatter soup over Bessie and the maid and to smash in pieces upon the crown of the professor's bald head."
the-magic-bon-bons,12,"At this atrocious act the senator rose from his seat with an exclamation of horror and glanced at his hostess.For some time Mrs. Bostwick had been staring straight ahead, with a dazed expression; but now, catching the senator's eye, she bowed gracefully and began reciting ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" in forceful tones.The senator shuddered. Such disgraceful rioting he had never seen nor heard before in a decent private family. He felt that his reputation was at stake, and, being the only sane person, apparently, in the room, there was no one to whom he might appeal."
the-magic-bon-bons,13,"The maid had run away to cry hysterically in the kitchen; Mr. Bostwick was singing ""O Promise Me;"" the professor was trying to kick the globes off the chandelier; Mrs. Bostwick had switched her recitation to ""The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck,"" and Bessie had stolen into the parlor and was pounding out the overture from the ""Flying Dutchman.""The senator was not at all sure he would not go crazy himself, presently; so he slipped away from the turmoil, and, catching up his had and coat in the hall, hurried from the house.That night he sat up late writing a political speech he was to deliver the next afternoon at Faneuil hall, but his experiences at the Bostwicks' had so unnerved him that he could scarcely collect his thoughts, and often he would pause and shake his head pityingly as he remembered the strange things he had seen in that usually respectable home."
the-magic-bon-bons,14,"The next day he met Mr. Bostwick in the street, but passed him by with a stony glare of oblivion. He felt he really could not afford to know this gentleman in the future. Mr. Bostwick was naturally indignant at the direct snub; yet in his mind lingered a faint memory of some quite unusual occurrences at his dinner party the evening before, and he hardly knew whether he dared resent the senator's treatment or not.The political meeting was the feature of the day, for the senator's eloquence was well known in Boston. So the big hall was crowded with people, and in one of the front rows sat the Bostwick family, with the learned Yale professor beside them. They all looked tired and pale, as if they had passed a rather dissipated evening, and the senator was rendered so nervous by seeing them that he refused to look in their direction a second time.While the mayor was introducing him the great man sat fidgeting in his chair; and, happening to put his thumb and finger into his vest pocket, he found the lavender-colored bonbon he had placed there the evening before."
the-magic-bon-bons,15,"""This may clear my throat,"" thought the senator, and slipped the bonbon into his mouth.A few minutes afterwards he arose before the vast audience, which greeted him with enthusiastic plaudits.""My friends,"" began the senator, in a grave voice, ""this is a most impressive and important occasion."""
the-magic-bon-bons,16,"Then he paused, balanced himself upon his left foot, and kicked his right leg into the air in the way favored by ballet-dancers!There was a hum of amazement and horror from the spectators, but the senator appeared not to notice it. He whirled around upon the tips of his toes, kicked right and left in a graceful manner, and startled a bald-headed man in the front row by casting a languishing glance in his direction."
the-magic-bon-bons,17,"Suddenly Claribel Sudds, who happened to be present, uttered a scream and sprang to her feet. Pointing an accusing finger at the dancing senator, she cried in a loud voice:""That's the man who stole my bonbons! Seize him! Arrest him! Don't let him escape!"""
the-magic-bon-bons,18,"But the ushers rushed her out of the hall, thinking she had gone suddenly insane; and the senator's friends seized him firmly and carried him out the stage entrance to the street, where they put him into an open carriage and instructed the driver to take him home.The effect of the magic bonbon was still powerful enough to control the poor senator, who stood upon the rear seat of the carriage and danced energetically all the way home, to the delight of the crowd of small boys who followed the carriage and the grief of the sober-minded citizens, who shook their heads sadly and whispered that ""another good man had gone wrong."""
the-magic-bon-bons,19,"It took the senator several months to recover from the shame and humiliation of this escapade; and, curiously enough, he never had the slightest idea what had induced him to act in so extraordinary a manner. Perhaps it was fortunate the last bonbon had now been eaten, for they might easily have caused considerably more trouble than they did.Of course Claribel went again to the wise chemist and signed a check for another box of magic bonbons; but she must have taken better care of these, for she is now a famous vaudeville actress."
the-magic-mirror,1,"A long, long while ago, before ever the White Men were seen in Senna,
there lived a man called Gopani-Kufa.

One day, as he was out hunting, he came upon a strange sight.  An
enormous python had caught an antelope and coiled itself around it. The
antelope, striking out in despair with its horns, had pinned the
python's neck to a tree. So deeply had its horns sunk in the soft
wood that neither creature could get away."
the-magic-mirror,2,"'Help!' cried the antelope, 'for I was doing no harm, yet I have been
caught. I would have been eaten, had I not defended myself.'

'Help me,' said the python, 'for I am Insato, King of all the Reptiles,
and will reward you well!'

Gopani-Kufa considered for a moment, then stabbing the antelope with
his assegai, he set the python free.

'I thank you,' said the python. 'Come back here with the new moon, when
I shall have eaten the antelope, and I will reward you as I promised.'

'Yes,' said the dying antelope, 'he will reward you, and lo! your
reward shall be your own undoing!'"
the-magic-mirror,3,"Gopani-Kufa went back to his kraal, and with the new moon he returned
again to the spot where he had saved the python.

Insato was lying upon the ground, still sleepy from the effects of his
huge meal, and when he saw the man he thanked him again, and said:
'Come with me now to Pita, which is my own country, and I will give you
what you will of all my possessions.'

Gopani-Kufa at first was afraid, thinking of what the antelope had
said, but finally he consented and followed Insato into the forest."
the-magic-mirror,4,"For several days they travelled, and at last they came to a hole
leading deep into the earth.  It was not very wide, but large enough to
admit a man.  'Hold on to my tail,' said Insato, 'and I will go down
first, drawing you after me.'  The man did so, and Insato entered.

Down, down, down they went for days, all the while getting deeper and
deeper into the earth, until at last the darkness ended and they
dropped into a beautiful country. Around them grew short green grass,
on which browsed herds of cattle and sheep and goats.  In the distance
Gopani-Kufa saw a great collection of houses all square, built of stone
and very tall, and their roofs were shining with gold and burnished
iron."
the-magic-mirror,5,"Gopani-Kufa turned to Insato, but found, in the place of the python, a
man, strong and handsome, with the great snake's skin wrapped round him
for covering; and on his arms and neck were rings of pure gold.

The man smiled.  'I am Insato,' said he, 'but in my own country I take
man's shape--even as you see me--for this is Pita, the land over which
I am king.'  He then took Gopani-Kufa by the hand and led him towards
the town."
the-magic-mirror,6,"On the way they passed rivers in which men and women were bathing and
fishing and boating; and farther on they came to gardens covered with
heavy crops of rice and maize, and many other grains which Gopani-Kufa
did not even know the name of.  And as they passed, the people who were
singing at their work in the fields, abandoned their labours and
saluted Insato with delight, bringing also palm wine and green
cocoanuts for refreshment, as to one returned from a long journey."
the-magic-mirror,7,"'These are my children!' said Insato, waving his hand towards the
people.  Gopani-Kufa was much astonished at all that he saw, but he
said nothing.  Presently they came to the town; everything here, too,
was beautiful, and everything that a man might desire he could obtain.
Even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver.

Insato conducted Gopani-Kufa to the palace, and showing him his rooms,
and the maidens who would wait upon him, told him that they would have
a great feast that night, and on the morrow he might name his choice of
the riches of Pita and it should be given him.  Then he was away."
the-magic-mirror,8,"Now Gopani-Kufa had a wasp called Zengi-mizi.  Zengi-mizi was not an
ordinary wasp, for the spirit of the father of Gopani-Kufa had entered
it, so that it was exceedingly wise.  In times of doubt Gopani-Kufa
always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done, so on this
occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried
it, saying: 'Zengi-mizi, what gift shall I ask of Insato to-morrow when
he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life?'

'Biz-z-z,' hummed Zengi-mizi, 'ask him for Sipao the Mirror.'  And it
flew back into its basket."
the-magic-mirror,9,"Gopani-Kufa was astonished at this answer; but knowing that the words
of Zengi-mizi were true words, he determined to make the request.  So
that night they feasted, and on the morrow Insato came to Gopani-Kufa
and, giving him greeting joyfully, he said:

'Now, O my friend, name your choice amongst my possessions and you
shall have it!'

'O king!' answered Gopani-Kufa, 'out of all your possessions I will
have the Mirror, Sipao.'

The king started.  'O friend, Gopani-Kufa,' he said, 'ask anything but
that!  I did not think that you would request that which is most
precious to me.'

'Let me think over it again then, O king,' said Gopani-Kufa, 'and
to-morrow I will let you know if I change my mind.'"
the-magic-mirror,10,"But the king was still much troubled, fearing the loss of Sipao, for
the mirror had magic powers, so that he who owned it had but to ask and
his wish would be fulfilled; to it Insato owed all that he possessed.

As soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi, out of
his basket.  'Zengi-mizi,' he said, 'the king seems loth to grant my
request for the Mirror--is there not some other thing of equal value
for which I might ask?'

And the wasp answered: 'There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa,
which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and
accomplishes the desires of him who owns it.  If the king hesitates, go
to him the next day, and the day after, and in the end he will bestow
the Mirror upon you, for you saved his life.'"
the-magic-mirror,11,"And it was even so.  For three days Gopani- Kufa returned the same
answer to the king, and, at last, with tears in his eyes, Insato gave
him the Mirror, which was of polished iron, saying: 'Take Sipao, then,
O Gopani- Kufa, and may thy wishes come true.  Go back now to thine own
country; Sipao will show you the way.'

Gopani-Kufa was greatly rejoiced, and, taking farewell of the king,
said to the Mirror:

'Sipao, Sipao, I wish to be back upon the Earth again!'

Instantly he found himself standing upon the upper earth; but, not
knowing the spot, he said again to the Mirror:

'Sipao, Sipao, I want the path to my own kraal!'

And behold! right before him lay the path!"
the-magic-mirror,12,"When he arrived home he found his wife and daughter mourning for him,
for they thought that he had been eaten by lions; but he comforted
them, saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his
way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again.

That night he asked Zengi-mizi, in whom sat the spirit of his father,
what he had better ask Sipao for next?

'Biz-z-z,' said the wasp, 'would you not like to be as great a chief as
Insato?'

And Gopani-Kufa smiled, and took the Mirror and said to it:

'Sipao, Sipao, I want a town as great as that of Insato, the King of
Pita; and I wish to be chief over it!'"
the-magic-mirror,13,"Then all along the banks of the Zambesi river, which flowed near by,
sprang up streets of stone buildings, and their roofs shone with gold
and burnished iron like those in Pita; and in the streets men and women
were walking, and young boys were driving out the sheep and cattle to
pasture; and from the river came shouts and laughter from the young men
and maidens who had launched their canoes and were fishing.  And when
the people of the new town beheld Gopani-Kufa they rejoiced greatly and
hailed him as chief."
the-magic-mirror,14,"Gopani-Kufa was now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles had
been, and he and his family moved into the palace that stood high above
the other buildings right in the middle of the town.  His wife was too
astonished at all these wonders to ask any questions, but his daughter
Shasasa kept begging him to tell her how he had suddenly become so
great; so at last he revealed the whole secret, and even entrusted
Sipao the Mirror to her care, saying:

'It will be safer with you, my daughter, for you dwell apart; whereas
men come to consult me on affairs of state, and the Mirror might be
stolen.'"
the-magic-mirror,15,"Then Shasasa took the Magic Mirror and hid it beneath her pillow, and
after that for many years Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and
wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once did he need to ask
Sipao to grant him a wish.

Now it happened that, after many years, when the hair of Gopani-Kufa
was turning grey with age, there came white men to that country.  Up
the Zambesi they came, and they fought long and fiercely with
Gopani-Kufa; but, because of the power of the Magic Mirror, he beat
them, and they fled to the sea-coast.  Chief among them was one Rei, a
man of much cunning, who sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's
power.  So one day he called to him a trusty servant named Butou, and
said: 'Go you to the town and find out for me what is the secret of its
greatness.'"
the-magic-mirror,16,"And Butou, dressing himself in rags, set out, and when he came to
Gopani-Kufa's town he asked for the chief; and the people took him into
the presence of Gopani-Kufa.  When the white man saw him he humbled
himself, and said: 'O Chief! take pity on me, for I have no home!  When
Rei marched against you I alone stood apart, for I knew that all the
strength of the Zambesi lay in your hands, and because I would not
fight against you he turned me forth into the forest to starve!'

And Gopani-Kufa believed the white man's story, and he took him in and
feasted him, and gave him a house."
the-magic-mirror,17,"In this way the end came.  For the heart of Shasasa, the daughter of
Gopani-Kufa, went forth to Butou the traitor, and from her he learnt
the secret of the Magic Mirror.  One night, when all the town slept, he
felt beneath her pillow and, finding the Mirror, he stole it and fled
back with it to Rei, the chief of the white men.

So it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was gazing up at the river
from a window of the palace he again saw the war-canoes of the white
men; and at the sight his spirit misgave him.

'Shasasa! my daughter!' he cried wildly, 'go fetch me the mirror, for
the white men are at hand.'

'Woe is me, my father!' she sobbed.  'The Mirror is gone!  For I loved
Butou the traitor, and he has stolen Sipao from me!'"
the-magic-mirror,18,"Then Gopani-Kufa calmed himself, and drew out Zengi-mizi from its rush
basket.

'O spirit of my father!' he said, 'what now shall I do?'

'O Gopani-Kufa!' hummed the wasp, 'there is nothing now that can be
done, for the words of the antelope which you slew are being fulfilled.'

'Alas!  I am an old man--I had forgotten!' cried the chief.  'The words
of the antelope were true words--my reward shall be my undoing--they
are being fulfilled!'

Then the white men fell upon the people of Gopani-Kufa and slew them
together with the chief and his daughter Shasasa; and since then all
the power of the Earth has rested in the hands of the white men, for
they have in their possession Sipao, the Magic Mirror."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,1,"As a punishment for having once upon a time used that foot against a
venerable medicine man, Aggo Dah Gauda had one leg looped up to his
thigh, so that he was obliged to get along by hopping. By dint of
practice he had become very skillful in this exercise, and he could make
leaps which seemed almost incredible.

Aggo had a beautiful daughter, and his chief care was to secure her from
being carried off by the king of the buffalos, who was the ruler of all
the herds of that kind, and had them entirely at his command to make
them do as he willed.

Dah Gauda, too, was quite an important person in his own way, for he
lived in great state, having a log house of his own, and a court-yard
which extended from the sill of his front-door as many hundred miles
westward as he chose to measure it.

Although he might claim this extensive privilege of ground, he advised
his daughter to keep within doors, and by no means to go far in the
neighborhood, as she would otherwise be sure to be stolen away, as he
was satisfied that the buffalo-king spent night and day lurking about
and lying in wait to seize her."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,2,"One sunshiny morning, when there were just two or three promising clouds
rolling moistly about the sky, Aggo prepared to go out a-fishing; but
before he left the lodge he reminded her of her strange and industrious
lover, whom she had never seen.

""My daughter,"" said he, ""I am going out to fish, and as the day will be
a pleasant one, you must recollect that we have an enemy near, who is
constantly going about with two eyes that never close, and do not expose
yourself out of the lodge.""

With this excellent advice, Aggo hopped off in high spirits; but he had
scarcely reached the fishing-ground when he heard a voice singing, at a
distance:

    Man with the leg tied up,
    Man with the leg tied up,
        Broken hip--hip--
            Hipped.

    Man with the leg tied up,
    Man with the leg tied up,
        Broken leg--leg--
            Legged."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,3,"There was no one in sight, but Aggo heard the words quite plainly, and
as he suspected the ditty to be the work of his enemies, the buffalos,
he hopped home as fast as his one leg could carry him.

Meantime, the daughter had no sooner been left alone in the lodge than
she thought with herself:

""It is hard to be thus forever kept in doors. But my father says it
would be dangerous to venture abroad. I know what I will do. I will get
on the top of the house, and there I can comb and dress my hair, and no
one can harm me.""

She accordingly ascended the roof and busied herself in untying and
combing her beautiful hair; for it was truly beautiful, not only of a
fine, glossy quality, but it was so very long that it hung over the
eaves of the house and reached down on the ground, as she sat dressing
it."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,4,"She was wholly occupied in this employment, without a thought of danger,
when, all of a sudden, the king of the buffalos came dashing on with his
herd of followers, and making sure of her by means of her drooping
tresses, he placed her upon the back of one of his favorite buffalos,
and away he cantered over the plains. Plunging into a river that bounded
his land, he bore her safely to his lodge on the other side.

And now the buffalo-king having secured the beautiful person of Aggo Dah
Gauda's daughter, he set to work to make her heart his own--a little
ceremony which it would have been, perhaps, wiser for his majesty, the
king of the buffalos, to have attended to before, for he now worked to
little purpose. Although he labored with great zeal to gain her
affections, she sat pensive and disconsolate in the lodge, among the
other females, and scarcely ever spoke, nor did she take the least
interest in the affairs of the king's household.

To the king himself she paid no heed, and although he breathed forth to
her every soft and gentle word he could think of, she sat still and
motionless for all the world like one of the lowly bushes by the door of
her father's lodge, when the summer wind has died away."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,5,"The king enjoined it upon the others in the lodge as a special edict, on
pain of instant death, to give to Aggo's daughter every thing that she
wanted, and to be careful not to displease her. They set before her the
choicest food. They gave her the seat of honor in the lodge. The king
himself went out hunting to obtain the most dainty meats, both of
animals and wild fowl, to pleasure her palate; and he treated her every
morning to a ride upon one of the royal buffalos, who was so gentle in
his motions as not even to disturb a single one of the tresses of the
beautiful hair of Aggo's daughter as she paced along.

And not content with these proofs of his attachment, the king would
sometimes fast from all food, and having thus purified his spirit and
cleared his voice, he would take his Indian flute, and, sitting before
the lodge, give vent to his feelings in pensive echoes, something after
this fashion:"
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,6,"My sweetheart,
    My sweetheart,
        Ah me!
    When I think of you,
    When I think of you,
        Ah me!
    What can I do, do, do?

    How I love you,
    How I love you,
        Ah me!
    Do not hate me,
    Do not hate me,
        Ah me!
    Speak--e'en berate me.
    When I think of you,
        Ah me!
    What can I do, do, do?"
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,7,"In the mean time, Aggo Dah Gauda had reached home, and finding that his
daughter had been stolen, his indignation was so thoroughly awakened
that he would have forthwith torn every hair from his head, but, being
entirely bald, this was out of the question, so, as an easy and natural
vent to his feelings, Aggo hopped off half a mile in every direction.
First he hopped east, then he hopped west, next he hopped north, and
again he hopped south, all in search of his daughter; till the one leg
was fairly tired out. Then he sat down in his lodge, and resting himself
a little, he reflected, and then he vowed that his single leg should
never know rest again until he had found his beautiful daughter and
brought her home. For this purpose he immediately set out.

Now that he proceeded more coolly, he could easily track the
buffalo-king until he came to the banks of the river, where he saw that
he had plunged in and swam over. There having been a frosty night or two
since, the water was so covered with thin ice that Aggo could not
venture upon it, even with one leg. He encamped hard by till it became
more solid, and then crossed over and pursued the trail."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,8,"As he went along he saw branches broken off and strewed behind, which
guided him in his course; for these had been purposely cast along by the
daughter. And the manner in which she had accomplished it was this. Her
hair was all untied when she was caught up, and being very long it took
hold of the branches as they darted along, and it was these twigs that
she broke off as signs to her father.

When Aggo came to the king's lodge it was evening. Carefully
approaching, he peeped through the sides, and saw his daughter sitting
disconsolate. She immediately caught his eye, and knowing that it was
her father come for her, she all at once appeared to relent in her
heart, and, asking for the royal dipper, said to the king, ""I will go
and get you a drink of water.""

This token of submission delighted his majesty, and, high in hope, he
waited with impatience for her return."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,9,"At last he went out, but nothing could be seen or heard of the captive
daughter. Calling together his followers, they sallied forth upon the
plains, and had not gone far when they espied by the light of the moon,
which was shining roundly just over the edge of the prairie, Aggo Dah
Gauda, his daughter in his arms, making all speed with his one leg
toward the west.

The buffalos being set on by their king, raised a great shout, and
scampered off in pursuit. They thought to overtake Aggo in less than no
time; but although he had a single leg only, it was in such fine
condition to go, that to every pace of theirs, he hopped the length of a
cedar-tree.

But the buffalo-king was well assured that he would be able to overtake
Aggo, hop as briskly as he might. It would be a mortal shame, thought
the king, to be outstripped by a man with one leg tied up; so, shouting
and cheering, and issuing orders on all sides, he set the swiftest of
his herd upon the track, with strict commands to take Aggo dead or
alive. And a curious sight it was to see."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,10,"At one time a buffalo would gain handsomely upon Aggo, and be just at
the point of laying hold of him, when off Aggo would hop, a good
furlong, in an oblique line, wide out of his reach; which bringing
him nearly in contact with another of the herd, away he would go again,
just as far off in another direction.

And in this way Aggo kept the whole company of the buffalos zig-zagging
across the plain, with the poor king at their head, running to and fro,
shouting among them and hurrying them about in the wildest way. It was
an extraordinary road that Aggo was taking toward home; and after a time
it so puzzled and bewildered the buffalos that they were driven half out
of their wits, and they roared, and brandished their tails, and foamed,
as if they would put out of countenance and frighten out of sight the
old man in the moon, who was looking on all the time, just above the
edge of the prairie.

As for the king himself, losing at last all patience at the absurd idea
of chasing a man with one leg all night long, he called his herd
together, and fled, in disgust, toward the west, and never more appeared
in all that part of the country."
the-man-with-his-leg-tied-up,11,"Aggo, relieved of his pursuers, hopped off a hundred steps in one, till
he reached the stream, crossed it in a twinkling of the eye, and bore
his daughter in triumph to his lodge.

In the course of time Aggo's beautiful daughter married a very worthy
young warrior, who was neither a buffalo-king nor so much as the owner
of any more of the buffalos than a splendid skin robe which he wore,
with great effect, thrown over his shoulders, on his wedding-day. On
which occasion, Aggo Dah Gauda hopped about on his one leg livelier than
ever."
the-mother,1,"A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed. The mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature.
Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one. He needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.
As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him. The old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand."
the-mother,2,"""Do you not think that I shall save him?"" said she. ""Our Lord will not take him from me!""
And the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks. Her head became so heavy--she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights. Now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold.
""What is that?"" said she, and looked on all sides. But the old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him. The old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.
But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.
Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black clothes. She said, ""Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child. He goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes!"""
the-mother,3,"""Oh, only tell me which way he went!"" said the mother. ""Tell me the way, and I shall find him!""
""I know it!"" said the woman in the black clothes. ""But before I tell it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child! I am fond of them. I have heard them before. I am Night. I saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!""
""I will sing them all, all!"" said the mother. ""But do not stop me now--I may overtake him--I may find my child!""
But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears. Then Night said, ""Go to the right, into the dark pine forest. Go to where I saw Death take his way with thy little child!"""
the-mother,4,"The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush. There was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.
""Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?"" said the mother.
""Yes,"" said the thorn-bush. ""But I will not tell thee which way he took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death. I shall become a lump of ice!""
And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might be thoroughly warmed. The thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm. The thorn-bush told her the way she should go."
the-mother,5,"She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat. The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her. Neither was it open, nor low enough that she could wade through it. Across it she must go if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless."
the-mother,6,"""Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!"" said the weeping mother. She wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters, and became two precious pearls. But the water bore her up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the opposite side. There stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up. But the poor mother could not see it. She had wept her eyes out.
""Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?"" said she.
""He has not come here yet!"" said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! ""How have you been able to find the way hither? And who has helped you?""
""OUR LORD has helped me,"" said she. ""He is merciful, and you will also be so! Where shall I find my little child?"""
the-mother,7,"""Nay, I know not,"" said the woman, ""and you cannot see! Many flowers and trees have withered this night. Death will soon come and plant them over again! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree or flower, just as everyone happens to be settled. They look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can also beat. Go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's. But what will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?""
""I have nothing to give,"" said the afflicted mother, ""but I will go to the world's end for you!""
""Nay, I have nothing to do there!"" said the woman. ""But you can give me your long black hair. You know yourself that it is fine, and that I like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always something!""
""Do you demand nothing else?"" said she. ""That I will gladly give you!""  And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white hair instead."
the-mother,8,"So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains. There stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name. Each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots. In other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat. Amongst millions she knew her child's."
the-mother,9,"""There it is!"" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.
""Don't touch the flower!"" said the old woman. ""But place yourself here, and when Death comes--I expect him every moment--do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD, and no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave.""
All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind mother could feel that it was Death that came.
""How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?"" he asked. ""How couldst thou come quicker than I?""
""I am a mother,"" said she."
the-mother,10,"And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower, but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down powerless.
""Thou canst not do anything against me!"" said Death.
""But OUR LORD can!"" said she.
""I only do His bidding!"" said Death. ""I am His gardener, I take all His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not tell thee.""
""Give me back my child!"" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, ""I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in despair.""
""Touch them not!"" said Death. ""Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy."""
the-mother,11,"""Another mother!"" said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of both the flowers.
""There, thou hast thine eyes,"" said Death; ""I fished them up from the lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again, they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well close by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.""
And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness.
""Both of them are God's will!"" said Death.
""Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?""  asked she.
""That I will not tell thee,"" said Death; ""but this thou shalt know from me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou saw'st--thy own child's future life!"""
the-mother,12,"Then the mother screamed with terror, ""Which of them was my child? Tell it me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather take it away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my prayers, and all that I have done!""
""I do not understand thee!"" said Death. ""Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!"""
the-mother,13,"Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our Lord: ""Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best! hear me not! hear me not!""
And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and went with it into the unknown land."
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,1,"ONCE on a time, a mouse and a bird and a sausage lived and kept house
together in perfect peace among themselves, and in great prosperity. It
was the bird's business to fly to the forest every day and bring back
wood. The mouse had to draw the water, make the fire, and set the table;
and the sausage had to do the cooking. Nobody is content in this world:
much will have more! One day the bird met another bird on the way, and
told him of his excellent condition in life. But the other bird called
him a poor simpleton to do so much work, while the two others led easy
lives at home."
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,2,"When the mouse had made up her fire and drawn water, she went to rest in
her little room until it was time to lay the cloth. The sausage stayed
by the saucepans, looked to it that the victuals were well cooked, and
just before dinner-time he stirred the broth or the stew three or four
times well round himself, so as to enrich and season and flavour it.
Then the bird used to come home and lay down his load, and they sat down
to table, and after a good meal they would go to bed and sleep their
fill till the next morning. It really was a most satisfactory life."
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,3,"But the bird came to the resolution next day never again to fetch wood:
he had, he said, been their slave long enough, now they must change
about and make a new arrangement So in spite of all the mouse and the
sausage could say, the bird was determined to have his own way. So they
drew lots to settle it, and it fell so that the sausage was to fetch
wood, the mouse was to cook, and the bird was to draw water."
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,4,"Now see what happened. The sausage went away after wood, the bird made
up the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and they waited until the
sausage should come home, bringing the wood for the next day. But the
sausage was absent so long, that they thought something must have
happened to him, and the bird went part of the way to see if he could
see anything of him. Not far off he met with a dog on the road, who,
looking upon the sausage as lawful prey, had picked him up, and made an
end of him. The bird then lodged a complaint against the dog as an open
and flagrant robber, but it was all no good, as the dog declared that he
had found forged letters upon the sausage, so that he deserved to lose
his life."
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,5,"The bird then very sadly took up the wood and carried it home himself,
and related to the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very
troubled, but determined to look on the bright side of things, and still
to remain together. And so the bird laid the cloth, and the mouse
prepared the food, and finally got into the pot, as the sausage used to
do, to stir and flavour the broth, but then she had to part with fur and
skin, and lastly with life!"
the-mouse-the-bird-and-the-sausage,6,"And when the bird came to dish up the dinner, there was no cook to be
seen; and he turned over the heap of wood, and looked and looked, but
the cook never appeared again. By accident the wood caught fire, and the
bird hastened to fetch water to put it out, but he let fall the bucket
in the well, and himself after it, and as he could not get out again, he
was obliged to be drowned."
the-one-handed-girl,1,"An old couple once lived in a hut under a grove of palm trees, and they
had one son and one daughter. They were all very happy together for many
years, and then the father became very ill, and felt he was going to
die. He called his children to the place where he lay on the floor--for
no one had any beds in that country--and said to his son, 'I have
no herds of cattle to leave you--only the few things there are in the
house--for I am a poor man, as you know. But choose: will you have my
blessing or my property?'

'Your property, certainly,' answered the son, and his father nodded.

'And you?' asked the old man of the girl, who stood by her brother.

'I will have blessing,' she answered, and her father gave her much
blessing."
the-one-handed-girl,2,"That night he died, and his wife and son and daughter mourned for him
seven days, and gave him a burial according to the custom of his people.
But hardly was the time of mourning over, than the mother was attacked
by a disease which was common in that country.

'I am going away from you,' she said to her children, in a faint voice;
'but first, my son, choose which you will have: blessing or property.'

'Property, certainly,' answered the son.

'And you, my daughter?'

'I will have blessing,' said the girl; and her mother gave her much
blessing, and that night she died."
the-one-handed-girl,3,"When the days of mourning were ended, the brother bade his sister put
outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother. So the
girl put them out, and he took them away, save only a small pot and a
vessel in which she could clean her corn. But she had no corn to clean.

She sat at home, sad and hungry, when a neighbour knocked at the door.

'My pot has cracked in the fire, lend me yours to cook my supper in, and
I will give you a handful of corn in return.'

And the girl was glad, and that night she was able to have supper
herself, and next day another woman borrowed her pot, and then another
and another, for never were known so many accidents as befell the
village pots at that time. She soon grew quite fat with all the corn she
earned with the help of her pot, and then one evening she picked up a
pumpkin seed in a corner, and planted it near her well, and it sprang
up, and gave her many pumpkins."
the-one-handed-girl,4,"At last it happened that a youth from her village passed through the
place where the girl's brother was, and the two met and talked.

'What news is there of my sister?' asked the young man, with whom things
had gone badly, for he was idle.

'She is fat and well-liking,' replied the youth, 'for the women borrow
her mortar to clean their corn, and borrow her pot to cook it in, and
for al this they give her more food than she can eat.' And he went his
way."
the-one-handed-girl,5,"Now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man, and he set
out at once, and before dawn he had reached the hut, and saw the pot and
the mortar were standing outside. He slung them over his shoulders and
departed, pleased with his own cleverness; but when his sister awoke
and sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast, she could find it
nowhere. At length she said to herself,

'Well, some thief must have stolen them while I slept. I will go and see
if any of my pumpkins are ripe.' And indeed they were, and so many that
the tree was almost broken by the weight of them. So she ate what she
wanted and took the others to the village, and gave them in exchange for
corn, and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these, and
that she was to bring every day all that she had. In this way she earned
more than she needed for herself, and soon was able to get another
mortar and cooking pot in exchange for her corn. Then she thought she
was quite rich."
the-one-handed-girl,6,"Unluckily someone else thought so too, and this was her brother's wife,
who had heard all about the pumpkin tree, and sent her slave with a
handful of grain to buy her a pumpkin. At first the girl told him that
so few were left that she could not spare any; but when she found that
he belonged to her brother, she changed her mind, and went out to the
tree and gathered the largest and the ripest that was there.

'Take this one,' she said to the slave, 'and carry it back to your
mistress, but tell her to keep the corn, as the pumpkin is a gift.'

The brother's wife was overjoyed at the sight of the fruit, and when she
tasted it, she declared it was the nicest she had ever eaten. Indeed,
all night she thought of nothing else, and early in the morning she
called another slave (for she was a rich woman) and bade him go and ask
for another pumpkin. But the girl, who had just been out to look at her
tree, told him that they were all eaten, so he went back empty-handed to
his mistress."
the-one-handed-girl,7,"In the evening her husband returned from hunting a long way off, and
found his wife in tears.

'What is the matter?' asked he.

'I sent a slave with some grain to your sister to buy some pumpkins, but
she would not sell me any, and told me there were none, though I know
she lets other people buy them.'

'Well, never mind now--go to sleep,' said he, 'and to-morrow I will go
and pull up the pumpkin tree, and that will punish her for treating you
so badly.'

So before sunrise he got up and set out for his sister's house, and
found her cleaning some corn."
the-one-handed-girl,8,"'Why did you refuse to sell my wife a pumpkin yesterday when she wanted
one?' he asked.

'The old ones are finished, and the new ones are not yet come,' answered
the girl. 'When her slave arrived two days ago, there were only four
left; but I gave him one, and would take no corn for it.'

'I do not believe you; you have sold them all to other people. I shall
go and cut down the pumpkin,' cried her brother in a rage.

'If you cut down the pumpkin you shall cut off my hand with it,'
exclaimed the girl, running up to her tree and catching hold of it. But
her brother followed, and with one blow cut off the pumpkin and her hand
too.

Then he went into the house and took away everything he could find, and
sold the house to a friend of his who had long wished to have it, and
his sister had no home to go to.

Meanwhile she had bathed her arm carefully, and bound on it some healing
leaves that grew near by, and wrapped a cloth round the leaves, and went
to hide in the forest, that her brother might not find her again."
the-one-handed-girl,9,"For seven days she wandered about, eating only the fruit that hung from
the trees above her, and every night she climbed up and tucked herself
safely among the creepers which bound together the big branches, so that
neither lions nor tigers nor panthers might get at her.

When she woke up on the seventh morning she saw from her perch smoke
coming up from a little town on the edge of the forest. The sight of
the huts made her feel more lonely and helpless than before. She longed
desperately for a draught of milk from a gourd, for there were no
streams in that part, and she was very thirsty, but how was she to earn
anything with only one hand? And at this thought her courage failed, and
she began to cry bitterly.

It happened that the king's son had come out from the town very early to
shoot birds, and when the sun grew hot he left tired."
the-one-handed-girl,10,"'I will lie here and rest under this tree,' he said to his attendants.
'You can go and shoot instead, and I will just have this slave to stay
with me!' Away they went, and the young man fell asleep, and slept long.
Suddenly he was awakened by something wet and salt falling on his face.

'What is that? Is it raining?' he said to his slave. 'Go and look.'

'No, master, it is not raining,' answered the slave.

'Then climb up the tree and see what it is,' and the slave climbed up,
and came back and told his master that a beautiful girl was sitting up
there, and that it must have been her tears which had fallen on the face
of the king's son.

'Why was she crying?' inquired the prince.

'I cannot tell--I did not dare to ask her; but perhaps she would tell
you.' And the master, greatly wondering, climbed up the tree."
the-one-handed-girl,11,"'What is the matter with you?' said he gently, and, as she only sobbed
louder, he continued:

'Are you a woman, or a spirit of the woods?'

'I am a woman,' she answered slowly, wiping her eyes with a leaf of the
creeper that hung about her.

'Then why do you cry?' he persisted.

'I have many things to cry for,' she replied, 'more than you could ever
guess.'

'Come home with me,' said the prince; 'it is not very far. Come home to
my father and mother. I am a king's son.'

'Then why are you here?' she said, opening her eyes and staring at him.

'Once every month I and my friends shoot birds in the forest,' he
answered, 'but I was tired and bade them leave me to rest. And you--what
are you doing up in this tree?'"
the-one-handed-girl,12,"At that she began to cry again, and told the king's son all that had
befallen her since the death of her mother.

'I cannot come down with you, for I do not like anyone to see me,' she
ended with a sob.

'Oh! I will manage all that,' said the king's son, and swinging himself
to a lower branch, he bade his slave go quickly into the town, and bring
back with him four strong men and a curtained litter. When the man
was gone, the girl climbed down, and hid herself on the ground in some
bushes. Very soon the slave returned with the litter, which was placed
on the ground close to the bushes where the girl lay."
the-one-handed-girl,13,"'Now go, all of you, and call my attendants, for I do not wish to say
here any longer,' he said to the men, and as soon as they were out of
sight he bade the girl get into the litter, and fasten the curtains
tightly. Then he got in on the other side, and waited till his
attendants came up.

'What is the matter, O son of a king?' asked they, breathless with
running.

'I think I am ill; I am cold,' he said, and signing to the bearers, he
drew the curtains, and was carried through the forest right inside his
own house.

'Tell my father and mother that I have a fever, and want some gruel,'
said he, 'and bid them send it quickly.'"
the-one-handed-girl,14,"So the slave hastened to the king's palace and gave his message, which
troubled both the king and the queen greatly. A pot of hot gruel was
instantly prepared, and carried over to the sick man, and as soon as the
council which was sitting was over, the king and his ministers went to
pay him a visit, bearing a message from the queen that she would follow
a little later.

Now the prince had pretended to be ill in order to soften his parent's
hearts, and the next day he declared he felt better, and, getting into
his litter, was carried to the palace in state, drums being beaten all
along the road.

He dismounted at the foot of the steps and walked up, a great parasol
being held over his head by a slave. Then he entered the cool, dark room
where his father and mother were sitting, and said to them:

'I saw a girl yesterday in the forest whom I wish to marry, and, unknown
to my attendants, I brought her back to my house in a litter. Give me
your consent, I beg, for no other woman pleases me as well, even though
she has but one hand!'"
the-one-handed-girl,15,"Of course the king and queen would have preferred a daughter-in-law
with two hands, and one who could have brought riches with her, but they
could not bear to say 'No' to their son, so they told him it should be
as he chose, and that the wedding feast should be prepared immediately.

The girl could scarcely believe her good fortune, and, in gratitude for
all the kindness shown her, was so useful and pleasant to her husband's
parents that they soon loved her.

By and bye a baby was born to her, and soon after that the prince was
sent on a journey by his father to visit some of the distant towns of
the kingdom, and to set right things that had gone wrong.

No sooner had he started than the girl's brother, who had wasted all the
riches his wife had brought him in recklessness and folly, and was now
very poor, chanced to come into the town, and as he passed he heard a
man say, 'Do you know that the king's son has married a woman who has
lost one of her hands?' On hearing these words the brother stopped and
asked, 'Where did he find such a woman?'

'In the forest,' answered the man, and the cruel brother guessed at once
it must be his sister."
the-one-handed-girl,16,"A great rage took possession of his soul as he thought of the girl whom
he had tried to ruin being after all so much better off than himself,
and he vowed that he would work her ill. Therefore that very afternoon
he made his way to the palace and asked to see the king.

When he was admitted to his presence, he knelt down and touched the
ground with his forehead, and the king bade him stand up and tell
wherefore he had come.

'By the kindness of your heart have you been deceived, O king,' said he.
'Your son has married a girl who has lost a hand. Do you know why she
had lost it? She was a witch, and has wedded three husbands, and each
husband she has put to death with her arts. Then the people of the town
cut off her hand, and turned her into the forest. And what I say is
true, for her town is my town also.'"
the-one-handed-girl,17,"The king listened, and his face grew dark. Unluckily he had a hasty
temper, and did not stop to reason, and, instead of sending to the town,
and discovering people who knew his daughter-in-law and could have told
him how hard she had worked and how poor she had been, he believed all
the brother's lying words, and made the queen believe them too. Together
they took counsel what they should do, and in the end they decided that
they also would put her out of the town. But this did not content the
brother.

'Kill her,' he said. 'It is no more than she deserves for daring to
marry the king's son. Then she can do no more hurt to anyone.'

'We cannot kill her,' answered they; 'if we did, our son would assuredly
kill us. Let us do as the others did, and put her out of the town. And
with this the envious brother was forced to be content.'

The poor girl loved her husband very much, but just then the baby was
more to her than all else in the world, and as long as she had him with
her, she did not very much mind anything. So, taking her son on her arm,
and hanging a little earthen pot for cooking round her neck, she left
her house with its great peacock fans and slaves and seats of ivory, and
plunged into the forest."
the-one-handed-girl,18,"For a while she walked, not knowing whither she went, then by and bye
she grew tired, and sat under a tree to rest and to hush her baby to
sleep. Suddenly she raised her eyes, and saw a snake wriggling from
under the bushes towards her.

'I am a dead woman,' she said to herself, and stayed quite still, for
indeed she was too frightened to move. In another minute the snake had
reached her side, and to her surprise he spoke.

'Open your earthen pot, and let me go in. Save me from sun, and I will
save you from rain,' and she opened the pot, and when the snake had
slipped in, she put on the cover. Soon she beheld another snake coming
after the other one, and when it had reached her it stopped and said,
'Did you see a small grey snake pass this way just now?'

'Yes,' she answered, 'it was going very quickly.'

'Ah, I must hurry and catch it up,' replied the second snake, and it
hastened on."
the-one-handed-girl,19,"When it was out of sight, a voice from the pot said:

'Uncover me,' and she lifted the lid, and the little grey snake slid
rapidly to the ground.

'I am safe now,' he said. 'But tell me, where are you going?'

'I cannot tell you, for I do not know,' she answered. 'I am just
wandering in the wood.'

'Follow me, and let us go home together,' said the snake, and the girl
followed his through the forest and along the green paths, till they
came to a great lake, where they stopped to rest.

'The sun is hot,' said the snake, 'and you have walked far. Take your
baby and bathe in that cool place where the boughs of the tree stretch
far over the water.'

'Yes, I will,' answered she, and they went in. The baby splashed and
crowed with delight, and then he gave a spring and fell right in, down,
down, down, and his mother could not find him, though she searched all
among the reeds."
the-one-handed-girl,20,"Full of terror, she made her way back to the bank, and called to the
snake, 'My baby is gone!--he is drowned, and never shall I see him
again.'

'Go in once more,' said the snake, 'and feel everywhere, even among the
trees that have their roots in the water, lest perhaps he may be held
fast there.'

Swiftly she went back and felt everywhere with her whole hand, even
putting her fingers into the tiniest crannies, where a crab could hardly
have taken shelter.

'No, he is not here,' she cried. 'How am I to live without him?' But the
snake took no notice, and only answered, 'Put in your other arm too.'

'What is the use of that?' she asked, 'when it has no hand to feel
with?' but all the same she did as she was bid, and in an instant the
wounded arm touched something round and soft, lying between two stones
in a clump of reeds.

'My baby, my baby!' she shouted, and lifted him up, merry and laughing,
and not a bit hurt or frightened.

'Have you found him this time?' asked the snake.

'Yes, oh, yes!' she answered, 'and, why--why--I have got my hand back
again!' and from sheer joy she burst into tears."
the-one-handed-girl,21,"The snake let her weep for a little while, and then he said--

'Now we will journey on to my family, and we will all repay you for the
kindness you showed to me.'

'You have done more than enough in giving me back my hand,' replied the
girl; but the snake only smiled.

'Be quick, lest the sun should set,' he answered, and began to wriggle
along so fast that the girl could hardly follow him."
the-one-handed-girl,22,"By and bye they arrived at the house in a tree where the snake lived,
when he was not travelling with his father and mother. And he told them
all his adventures, and how he had escaped from his enemy. The father
and mother snake could not do enough to show their gratitude. They made
their guest lie down on a hammock woven of the strong creepers
which hung from bough to bough, till she was quite rested after her
wanderings, while they watched the baby and gave him milk to drink from
the cocoa-nuts which they persuaded their friends the monkeys to crack
for them. They even managed to carry small fruit tied up in their tails
for the baby's mother, who felt at last that she was safe and at peace.
Not that she forgot her husband, for she often thought of him and longed
to show him her son, and in the night she would sometimes lie awake and
wonder where he was."
the-one-handed-girl,23,"In this manner many weeks passed by.

And what was the prince doing?

Well, he had fallen very ill when he was on the furthest border of the
kingdom, and he was nursed by some kind people who did not know who he
was, so that the king and queen heard nothing about him. When he was
better he made his way home again, and into his father's palace, where
he found a strange man standing behind the throne with the peacock's
feathers. This was his wife's brother, whom the king had taken into high
favour, though, of course, the prince was quite ignorant of what had
happened.

For a moment the king and queen stared at their son, as if he had been
unknown to them; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that
his shoulders were bowed like those of an old man."
the-one-handed-girl,24,"'Have you forgotten me so soon?' he asked.

At the sound of his voice they gave a cry and ran towards him, and
poured out questions as to what had happened, and why he looked like
that. But the prince did not answer any of them.

'How is my wife?' he said. There was a pause.

Then the queen replied:

'She is dead.'

'Dead!' he repeated, stepping a little backwards. 'And my child?'

'He is dead too.'

The young man stood silent. Then he said, 'Show me their graves.'"
the-one-handed-girl,25,"At these words the king, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, took
heart again, for had he not prepared two beautiful tombs for his son to
see, so that he might never, never guess what had been done to his wife?
All these months the king and queen had been telling each other how good
and merciful they had been not to take her brother's advice and to put
her to death. But now, this somehow did not seem so certain.

Then the king led the way to the courtyard just behind the palace, and
through the gate into a beautiful garden where stood two splendid
tombs in a green space under the trees. The prince advanced alone, and,
resting his head against the stone, he burst into tears. His father and
mother stood silently behind with a curious pang in their souls which
they did not quite understand. Could it be that they were ashamed of
themselves?

But after a while the prince turned round, and walking past them in to
the palace he bade the slaves bring him mourning. For seven days no
one saw him, but at the end of them he went out hunting, and helped his
father rule his people. Only no one dared to speak to him of his wife
and son."
the-one-handed-girl,26,"At last one morning, after the girl had been lying awake all night
thinking of her husband, she said to her friend the snake:

'You have all shown me much kindness, but now I am well again, and want
to go home and hear some news of my husband, and if he still mourns for
me!' Now the heart of the snake was sad at her words, but he only said:

'Yes, thus it must be; go and bid farewell to my father and mother, but
if they offer you a present, see that you take nothing but my father's
ring and my mother's casket.'

So she went to the parent snakes, who wept bitterly at the thought of
losing her, and offered her gold and jewels as much as she could carry
in remembrance of them. But the girl shook her head and pushed the
shining heap away from her.

'I shall never forget you, never,' she said in a broken voice, 'but the
only tokens I will accept from you are that little ring and this old
casket.'"
the-one-handed-girl,27,"The two snakes looked at each other in dismay. The ring and the casket
were the only things they did not want her to have. Then after a short
pause they spoke.

'Why do you want the ring and casket so much? Who has told you of them?'

'Oh, nobody; it is just my fancy,' answered she. But the old snakes
shook their heads and replied:

'Not so; it is our son who told you, and, as he said, so it must be. If
you need food, or clothes, or a house, tell the ring and it will find
them for you. And if you are unhappy or in danger, tell the casket and
it will set things right.' Then they both gave her their blessing, and
she picked up her baby and went her way.

She walked for a long time, till at length she came near the town where
her husband and his father dwelt. Here she stopped under a grove of palm
trees, and told the ring that she wanted a house."
the-one-handed-girl,28,"'It is ready, mistress,' whispered a queer little voice which made
her jump, and, looking behind her, she saw a lovely palace made of the
finest woods, and a row of slaves with tall fans bowing before the door.
Glad indeed was she to enter, for she was very tired, and, after eating
a good supper of fruit and milk which she found in one of the rooms, she
flung herself down on a pile of cushions and went to sleep with her baby
beside her.

Here she stayed quietly, and every day the baby grew taller and
stronger, and very soon he could run about and even talk. Of course the
neighbours had a great deal to say about the house which had been built
so quickly--so very quickly--on the outskirts of the town, and invented
all kinds of stories about the rich lady who lived in it. And by and
bye, when the king returned with his son from the wars, some of these
tales reached his ears.

'It is really very odd about that house under the palms,' he said to the
queen; 'I must find out something of the lady whom no one ever sees. I
daresay it is not a lady at all, but a gang of conspirators who want to
get possession of my throne. To-morrow I shall take my son and my chief
ministers and insist on getting inside.'"
the-one-handed-girl,29,"Soon after sunrise next day the prince's wife was standing on a little
hill behind the house, when she saw a cloud of dust coming through the
town. A moment afterwards she heard faintly the roll of the drums that
announced the king's presence, and saw a crowd of people approaching the
grove of palms. Her heart beat fast. Could her husband be among them?
In any case they must not discover her there; so just bidding the ring
prepare some food for them, she ran inside, and bound a veil of golden
gauze round her head and face. Then, taking the child's hand, she went
to the door and waited.

In a few minutes the whole procession came up, and she stepped forward
and begged them to come in and rest.

'Willingly,' answered the king; 'go first, and we will follow you.'

They followed her into a long dark room, in which was a table covered
with gold cups and baskets filled with dates and cocoa-nuts and all
kinds of ripe yellow fruits, and the king and the prince sat upon
cushions and were served by slaves, while the ministers, among whom she
recognised her own brother, stood behind."
the-one-handed-girl,30,"'Ah, I owe all my misery to him,' she said to herself. 'From the first
he has hated me,' but outwardly she showed nothing. And when the king
asked her what news there was in the town she only answered:

'You have ridden far; eat first, and drink, for you must be hungry and
thirsty, and then I will tell you my news.'

'You speak sense,' answered the king, and silence prevailed for some
time longer. Then he said:

'Now, lady, I have finished, and am refreshed, therefore tell me, I pray
you, who you are, and whence you come? But, first, be seated.'

She bowed her head and sat down on a big scarlet cushion, drawing her
little boy, who was asleep in a corner, on to her knee, and began to
tell the story of her life. As her brother listened, he would fain have
left the house and hidden himself in the forest, but it was his duty to
wave the fan of peacock's feathers over the king's head to keep off the
flies, and he knew he would be seized by the royal guards if he tried
to desert his post. He must stay where he was, there was no help for
it, and luckily for him the king was too much interested in the tale to
notice that the fan had ceased moving, and that flies were dancing right
on the top of his thick curly hair."
the-one-handed-girl,31,"The story went on, but the story-teller never once looked at the prince,
even through her veil, though he on his side never moved his eyes from
her. When she reached the part where she had sat weeping in the tree,
the king's son could restrain himself no longer.

'It is my wife,' he cried, springing to where she sat with the sleeping
child in her lap. 'They have lied to me, and you are not dead after all,
nor the boy either! But what has happened? Why did they lie to me?
and why did you leave my house where you were safe?' And he turned and
looked fiercely at his father.

'Let me finish my tale first, and then you will know,' answered she,
throwing back her veil, and she told how her brother had come to the
palace and accused her of being a witch, and had tried to persuade the
king to slay her. 'But he would not do that,' she continued softly, 'and
after all, if I had stayed on in your house, I should never have met the
snake, nor have got my hand back again. So let us forget all about it,
and be happy once more, for see! our son is growing quite a big boy.'

'And what shall be done to your brother?' asked the king, who was glad
to think that someone had acted in this matter worse than himself.

'Put him out of the town,' answered she."
the-origin-of-the-robin,1,"An old man had an only son, named Iadilla, who had come to that age
which is thought to be most proper to make the long and final fast which
is to secure through life a guardian genius or spirit. The father was
ambitious that his son should surpass all others in whatever was deemed
wisest and greatest among his people. To accomplish his wish, he thought
it necessary that the young Iadilla should fast a much longer time than
any of those renowned for their power or wisdom, whose fame he coveted.

He therefore directed his son to prepare with great ceremony for the
important event. After he had been several times in the sweating-lodge
and bath, which were to prepare and purify him for communion with his
good spirit, he ordered him to lie down upon a clean mat in a little
lodge expressly provided for him. He enjoined upon him at the same time
to endure his fast like a man, and promised that at the expiration of
twelve days he should receive food and the blessing of his father."
the-origin-of-the-robin,2,"The lad carefully observed the command, and lay with his face covered,
calmly awaiting the approach of the spirit which was to decide his good
or evil fortune for all the days of his life.

Every morning his father came to the door of the little lodge and
encouraged him to persevere, dwelling at length on the vast honor and
renown that must ever attend him, should he accomplish the full term of
trial allotted to him.

To these glowing words of promise and glory the boy never replied, but
he lay without the least sign of discontent or murmuring until the ninth
day, when he addressed his father as follows:

""My father, my dreams forbode evil. May I break my fast now, and at a
more favorable time make a new fast?"""
the-origin-of-the-robin,3,"The father answered:

""My son, you know not what you ask. If you get up now, all your glory
will depart. Wait patiently a little longer. You have but three days
more, and your term will be completed. You know it is for your own good,
and I encourage you to persevere. Shall not your aged father live to see
you a star among the chieftains and the beloved of battle?""

The son assented; and covering himself more closely, that he might shut
out the light which prompted him to complain, he lay till the eleventh
day, when he repeated his request.

The father addressed Iadilla as he had the day before, and promised that
he would himself prepare his first meal, and bring it to him by the dawn
of the morning.

The son moaned, and the father added:

""Will you bring shame upon your father when his sun is falling in the
west?""

""I will not shame you, my father,"" replied Iadilla; and he lay so still
and motionless that you could only know that he was living by the gentle
heaving of his breast."
the-origin-of-the-robin,4,"At the spring of day, the next morning, the father, delighted at having
gained his end, prepared a repast for his son, and hastened to set it
before him. On coming to the door of the little lodge, he was surprised
to hear his son talking to himself. He stooped his ear to listen, and,
looking through a small opening, he was yet more astonished when he
beheld his son painted with vermilion over all his breast, and in the
act of finishing his work by laying on the paint as far back on his
shoulders as he could reach with his hands, saying at the same time, to
himself:

""My father has destroyed my fortune as a man. He would not listen to my
requests. He has urged me beyond my tender strength. He will be the
loser. I shall be forever happy in my new state, for I have been
obedient to my parent. He alone will be the sufferer, for my guardian
spirit is a just one. Though not propitious to me in the manner I
desired, he has shown me pity in another way--he has given me another
shape; and now I must go."""
the-origin-of-the-robin,5,"At this moment the old man broke in, exclaiming:

""My son! my son! I pray you leave me not!""

But the young man, with the quickness of a bird, had flown to the top of
the lodge and perched himself on the highest pole, having been changed
into a beautiful robin red-breast. He looked down upon his father with
pity beaming in his eyes, and addressed him as follows:"
the-origin-of-the-robin,6,"""Regret not, my father, the change you behold. I shall be happier in my
present state than I could have been as a man. I shall always be the
friend of men, and keep near their dwellings. I shall ever be happy and
contented; and although I could not gratify your wishes as a warrior, it
will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace
and joy. I will cheer you by my songs, and strive to inspire in others
the joy and lightsomeness of heart I feel in my present state. This will
be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected. I am now
free from the cares and pains of human life. My food is spontaneously
furnished by the mountains and fields, and my pathway of life is in the
bright air.""

Then stretching himself on his toes, as if delighted with the gift of
wings, Iadilla caroled one of his sweetest songs, and flew away into a
neighboring wood."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,1,"Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
    In walks the little dog--says ""Pussy are you there?
    How do you do mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how do you do?""
    ""I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!""
                                       Old Rhyme."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,2,"ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a
little dog called Duchess to tea.

""Come in good time, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby's letter, ""and we will
have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish
with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it
all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!"" wrote Ribby."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,3,"Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:--""I will come with much
pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. _I_ was just
going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat
something MOST DELICIOUS.""

""I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,"" wrote Duchess; and then at
the end she added--""I hope it isn't mouse?""

And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched
out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she
gave her letter to the postman."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,4,"But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's
letter over and over again.

""I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!"" said Duchess to herself--""I
really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it,
because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink
and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were
both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.""

Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at
it.

""It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put
in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the
middle with a fork to let out the steam--Oh I do wish I could eat my own
pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!"""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,5,"Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby's letter again--

""A pink and white pie-dish-and YOU shall eat it all. 'You' means
me--then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and
white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins..... Oh what
a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven
when Ribby isn't there?""

Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!"
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,6,"Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she
was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the
oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and
handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie
into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.

""The top oven bakes too quickly,"" said Ribby to herself. ""It is a pie of
the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have
taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a
fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast--rather big
mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior
company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit."""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,7,"Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a
can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.

Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as
well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put
them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock
and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the
tables and chairs.

Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best
china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace.
The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the
dinner-plates were white and blue."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,8,"When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish,
and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.

When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very
comfortable.

Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to
the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a
pot of marmalade.

And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other
end of the village.

Ribby met Duchess half-way own the street, also carrying a basket,
covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not
speak, because they were going to have a party."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,9,"As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply
ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!

Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out,
after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation--

""A little DOG indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey! And a PIE
for afternoon tea! The very idea!"" said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went
home."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,10,"There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she
was coming in at the front door.

""I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,"" said
Ribby.

But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of
baked mouse!

Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.

""It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put
mine in! And I can t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of
the other handles; I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but
I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what
she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the
back door!"""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,11,"Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she
picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and
passed the time until the clock struck four.

Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no
one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her
dress.

She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin
apron and tippet.

""It is very strange,"" said Ribby, ""I did not THINK I left that drawer
pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?""

She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the
hob. She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely
brown, and it was steaming hot.

She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ""I am glad I
used the BOTTOM oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have
been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can
there really have been some one in the house?"""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,12,"Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She
ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to
wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.

""I wonder if Ribby has taken MY pie out of the oven yet?"" said Duchess,
""and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?""

At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little
tap-tappity. ""Is Mrs. Ribston at home?"" inquired Duchess in the porch.

""Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?"" cried Ribby. ""I hope I
see you well?""

""Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?"" said
Duchess. ""I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!""

""Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!""

""Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess; ""what a lovely
white tea-cloth!.... Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?""

""I think it wants another five minutes,"" said Ribby. ""Just a shade
longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my
dear Duchess?""

""Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?""

""With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how
sweetly pretty!"""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,13,"Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--

""How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse
and bacon----""

She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the
tea-table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out
the pie.

Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.

Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up
on a chair.

""I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and
marmalade,"" said Ribby.

""Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!""

""I beg your pardon?"" said Ribby.

""May I pass you the marmalade?"" said Duchess hurriedly."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,14,"The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They
disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!

""I think""--(thought the Duchess to herself)--""I THINK it would be wiser
if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything
when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a
quicker oven than my own.""

""How fast Duchess is eating!"" thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered
her fifth muffin.

The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already,
and was fumbling with the spoon.

""A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?"" said Ribby.

""Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.""

""The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?""

""The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,"" said Duchess, blushing under
her black coat.

""Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby; ""I don't think
that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.""

Duchess fumbled with the spoon--""I can't find it!"" she said anxiously.

""There isn't a patty-pan,"" said Ribby, looking perplexed.

""Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?"" said Duchess.

""There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin
articles in puddings and pies. It is most undesirable--(especially when
people swallow in lumps!)"" she added in a lower voice."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,15,"Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.
""My Great-aunt Squintina (grandmother of Cousin Tabitha Twitchit)--died
of a thimble in a Christmas plum-pudding. _I_ never put any article of
metal in MY puddings or pies.""
Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.
""I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.""
Duchess set up a howl.
""I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear
Ribby, I do feel so ill!""
""It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.""
Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.
""Oh I feel so dreadful. I have swallowed a patty-pan!""
""There was NOTHING in the pie,"" said Ribby severely.
""Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!""
""Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think
you feel it?""
""Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby; I have swallowed a
large tin patty-pan with a sharp scalloped edge!""

""Shall I run for the doctor? I will just lock up the spoons!""

""Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he
will certainly understand."""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,16,"Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and
hurried to the village to look for the doctor.

She found him at the smithy.

He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he
had obtained at the post office.

""Gammon? ha! HA!"" said he, with his head on one side.

Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.

""Spinach? ha! HA!"" said he, and accompanied her with alacrity.

He hopped so fast that Ribby--had to run. It was most conspicuous. All
the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.

""I KNEW they would over-eat themselves!"" said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit."
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,17,"But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had
happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the
fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.

""How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!""

She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again
with a spoon.

""No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie
except me, so I must have swallowed it!""

She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire
crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!"
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,18,"Duchess started! She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich
steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,--and
through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a
little tin patty-pan!

Duchess drew a long breath--

""Then I must have been eating MOUSE!... NO wonder I feel ill.... But
perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!""
Duchess reflected--""What a very awkward thing to have to explain to
Ribby! I think I will put my pie in the back-yard and say nothing about
it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away."" She put it
outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her
eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.
""Gammon, ha, HA?"" said the doctor. 
""I am feeling very much better,"" said Duchess, waking up with a jump.
""I am truly glad to hear it!"" He has brought you a pill, my dear
Duchess!"" 
""I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,"" said
Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in
his beak. 
""It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little
milk, my dear Duchess!"" 
""Gammon? Gammon?"" said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked. 
""Don't say that again!"" said Ribby, losing her temper--""Here, take this
bread and jam, and get out into the yard!"" 
""Gammon and spinach! ha ha HA!"" shouted Dr. Maggotty triumphantly
outside the back door. 
""I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess. ""Do you
not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?""
""Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess. I will lend you a nice warm
shawl, and you shall take my arm."" 
""I would not trouble you for worlds; I feel wonderfully better. One pill
of Dr. Maggotty----""
""Indeed it is most admirable, if it has cured you of a patty-pan! I will
call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept."""
the-pie-and-the-patty-pan,19,"Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started
home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone
in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round
to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.

Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The
jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of
a patty-pan.

""Gammon, ha, HA!"" he shouted when he saw Duchess's little black nose
peeping round the corner.

Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!

When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things,
she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the
yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where Dr Maggotty had
considerately left it.

Ribby stared with amazement--""Did you ever see the like! so there really
WAS a patty-pan?.... But my patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.
Well I never did!.... Next time I want to give a party--I will invite
Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!"""
the-queen-of-heaven,1,"The Queen of Heaven, who is also known as the Holy Mother, was inmortal life a maiden of Fukien, named Lin. She was pure, reverentialand pious in her ways and died at the age of seventeen. She shows herpower on the seas and for this reason the seamen worship her. Whenthey are unexpectedly attacked by wind and waves, they call on her andshe is always ready to hear their pleas."
the-queen-of-heaven,2,"There are many seamen in Fukien, and every year people are lost atsea. And because of this, most likely, the Queen of Heaven took pityon the distress of her people during her lifetime on earth. And sinceher thoughts are uninterruptedly turned toward aiding the drowning intheir distress, she now appears frequently on the seas."
the-queen-of-heaven,3,"In every ship that sails a picture of the Queen of Heaven hangs in thecabin, and three paper talismans are also kept on shipboard. On thefirst she is painted with crown and scepter, on the second as a maidenin ordinary dress, and on the third she is pictured with flowing hair,barefoot, standing with a sword in her hand. When the ship is indanger the first talisman is burnt, and help comes. But if this is ofno avail, then the second and finally the third picture is burned. Andif no help comes then there is nothing more to be done."
the-queen-of-heaven,4,"When seamen lose their course among wind and waves and darklingclouds, they pray devoutly to the Queen of Heaven. Then a red lanternappears on the face of the waters. And if they follow the lantern theywill win safe out of all danger. The Queen of Heaven may often be seenstanding in the skies, dividing the wind with her sword. When she doesthis the wind departs for the North and South, and the waves growsmooth."
the-queen-of-heaven,5,"A wooden wand is always kept before her holy picture in the cabin. Itoften happens that the fish-dragons play in the seas. They are twogiant fish who spout up water against one another till the sun in thesky is obscured, and the seas are shrouded in profound darkness. Andoften, in the distance, one may see a bright opening in the darkness.If the ship holds a course straight for this opening it will winthrough, and is suddenly floating in calm waters again. Looking back,one may see the two fishes still spouting water, and the ship willhave passed directly beneath their jaws. But a storm is always nearwhen the fish dragons swim; therefore it is well to burn paper or woolso that the dragons do not draw the ship down into the depths. Or theMaster of the Wand may burn incense before the wand in the cabin. Thenhe must take the wand and swing it over the water three times, in acircle. If he does so the dragons will draw in their tails anddisappear."
the-queen-of-heaven,6,"When the ashes in the censer fly up into the air without any cause,and are scattered about, it is a sign that great danger isthreatening.Nearly two-hundred years ago an army was fitted out to subdue theisland of Formosa. The captain's banner had been dedicated with theblood of a white horse. Suddenly the Queen of Heaven appeared at thetip of the banner-staff. In another moment she had disappeared, butthe invasion was successful."
the-queen-of-heaven,7,"On another occasion, in the days of Kien Lung, the minister DschouLing was ordered to install a new king in the Liu-Kiu Islands. Whenthe fleet was sailing by south of Korea, a storm arose, and his shipwas driven toward the Black Whirlpool. The water had the color of ink,sun and moon lost their radiance, and the word was passed about thatthe ship had been caught in the Black Whirlpool, from which no livingman had ever returned. The seaman and travelers awaited their end withlamentations. Suddenly an untold number of lights, like red lanterns,appeared on the surface of the water. Then the seamen were overjoyedand prayed in the cabins. ""Our lives are saved!"" they cried, ""the HolyMother has come to our aid!"" And truly, a beautiful maiden with goldenearrings appeared. She waved her hand in the air and the winds becamestill and the waves grew even. And it seemed as though the ship werebeing drawn along by a mighty hand. It moved plashing through thewaves, and suddenly it was beyond the limits of the Black Whirlpool."
the-queen-of-heaven,8,"Dschou Ling on his return told of this happening, and begged thattemples be erected in honor of the Queen of Heaven, and that she beincluded in the list of the gods. And the emperor granted his prayer.Since then temples of the Queen of Heaven are to be found in allsea-port towns, and her birthday is celebrated on the eighth day ofthe fourth month with spectacles and sacrifices."
the-raspberry-worm,1,"'Phew!' cried Lisa.

'Ugh!' cried Aina.

'What now?' cried the big sister.

'A worm!' cried Lisa.

'On the raspberry!' cried Aina.

'Kill it!' cried Otto.

'What a fuss over a poor little worm!' said the big sister scornfully.

'Yes, when we had cleaned the raspberries so carefully,' said Lisa.

'It crept out from that very large one,' put in Aina.

'And supposing someone had eaten the raspberry,' said Lisa."
the-raspberry-worm,2,"'Then they would have eaten the worm, too,' said Aina.

'Well, what harm?' said Otto.

'Eat a worm!' cried Lisa.

'And kill him with one bite!' murmured Aina.

'Just think of it!' said Otto laughing.

'Now it is crawling on the table,' cried Aina again.

'Blow it away!' said the big sister.

'Tramp on it!' laughed Otto."
the-raspberry-worm,3,"But Lisa took a raspberry leaf, swept the worm carefully on to the
leaf and carried it out into the yard. Then Aina noticed that a sparrow
sitting on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm,
so she took up the leaf, carried it out into the wood and hid it under a
raspberry bush where the greedy sparrow could not find it. Yes, and
what more is there to tell about a raspberry worm? Who would give three
straws for such a miserable little thing? Yes, but who would not like
to live in such a pretty home as it lives in; in such a fresh fragrant
dark-red cottage, far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green
leaves!"
the-raspberry-worm,4,"Now it was just dinner time, so they all had a dinner of raspberries
and cream. 'Be careful with the sugar, Otto,' said the big sister; but
Otto's plate was like a snowdrift in winter, with just a little red
under the snow.

Soon after dinner the big sister said: 'Now we have eaten up the
raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter; it
would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries, then we could
clean them this evening, and to-morrow we could cook them in the big
preserving pan, and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our
bread!'"
the-raspberry-worm,5,"'Come, let us go to the wood and pick,' said Lisa.

'Yes, let us,' said Aina. 'You take the yellow basket and I will take
the green one.'

'Don't get lost, and come back safely in the evening,' said the big
sister.

'Greetings to the raspberry worm,' said Otto, mockingly. 'Next time I
meet him I shall do him the honour of eating him up.'"
the-raspberry-worm,6,"So Aina and Lisa went off to the wood. Ah! how delightful it was there,
how beautiful! It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the
fallen trees, and getting caught in the branches, and waging war with
the juniper bushes and the midges, but what did that matter? The girls
climbed well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the
wood.

There were plenty of bilberries and elder berries, but no raspberries.
They wandered on and on, and at last they came... No, it could not be
true!... they came to a large raspberry wood. The wood had been on fire
once, and now raspberry bushes had grown up, and there were raspberry
bushes and raspberry bushes as far as the eye could see. Every bush was
weighted to the ground with the largest, dark red, ripe raspberries,
such a wealth of berries as two little berry pickers had never found
before!"
the-raspberry-worm,7,"Lisa picked, Aina picked. Lisa ate, Aina ate, and in a little while
their baskets were full.

'Now we shall go home,' said Aina. 'No, let us gather a few more,' said
Lisa. So they put the baskets down on the ground and began to fill their
pinafores, and it was not long before their pinafores were full, too.

'Now we shall go home,' said Lina. 'Yes, now we shall go home,' said
Aina. Both girls took a basket in one hand and held up her apron in the
other and then turned to go home. But that was easier said than done.
They had never been so far in the great wood before, they could not find
any road nor path, and soon the girls noticed that they had lost their
way."
the-raspberry-worm,8,"The worst of it was that the shadows of the tress were becoming so long
in the evening sunlight, the birds were beginning to fly home, and the
day was closing in. At last the sun went down behind the pine tops, and
it was cool and dusky in the great wood.

The girls became anxious but went steadily on, expecting that the wood
would soon end, and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of
their home.

After they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark. At
last they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes, and when they
looked around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness,
that they were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they
had picked their baskets and their aprons full. Then they were so tired
that they sat down on a stone and began to cry."
the-raspberry-worm,9,"'I am so hungry,' said Lisa.

'Yes,' said Aina, 'if we had only two good meat sandwiches now.'

As she said that, she felt something in her hand, and when she looked
down, she saw a large sandwich of bread and chicken, and at the same
time Lisa said: 'How very queer! I have a sandwich in my hand.'

'And I, too,' said Aina. 'Will you dare to eat it?'

'Of course I will,' said Lisa. 'Ah, if we only had a good glass of milk
now!'"
the-raspberry-worm,10,"Just as she said that she felt a large glass of milk between her
fingers, and at the same time Aina cried out, 'Lisa! Lisa! I have a
glass of milk in my hand! Isn't it queer?'

The girls, however, were very hungry, so they ate and drank with a good
appetite. When they had finished Aina yawned, stretched out her arms and
said: 'Oh, if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now!'

Scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side, and
there beside Lisa was one too. This seemed to the girls more and more
wonderful, but tired and sleepy as they were, they thought no more about
it, but crept into the little beds, drew the coverlets over their heads
and were soon asleep."
the-raspberry-worm,11,"When they awoke the sun was high in the heavens, the wood was beautiful
in the summer morning, and the birds were flying about in the branches
and the tree tops.

At first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had
slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes. They looked at each other,
they looked at their beds, which were of the finest flax covered over
with leaves and moss. At last Lisa said: 'Are you awake, Aina?'

'Yes,' said Aina.

'But I am still dreaming,' said Lisa.

'No,' said Aina, 'but there is certainly some good fairy living among
these raspberry bushes. Ah, if we had only a hot cup of coffee now, and
a nice piece of white bread to dip into it!'"
the-raspberry-worm,12,"Scarcely had she finished speaking when she saw beside her a little
silver tray with a gilt coffee-pot, two cups of rare porcelain, a sugar
basin of fine crystal, silver sugar tongs, and some good fresh white
bread. The girls poured out the beautiful coffee, put in the cream and
sugar, and tasted it; never in their lives had they drunk such beautiful
coffee.

'Now I should like to know very much who has given us all this,' said
Lisa gratefully.

'I have, my little girls,' said a voice just then from the bushes."
the-raspberry-worm,13,"The children looked round wonderingly, and saw a little kind-looking old
man, in a white coat and a red cap, limping out from among the bushes,
for he was lame in his left foot; neither Lisa nor Aina could utter a
word, they were so filled with surprise.

'Don't be afraid, little girls,' he said smiling kindly at them; he
could not laugh properly because his mouth was crooked. 'Welcome to my
kingdom! Have you slept well and eaten well and drunk well?' he asked.

'Yes, indeed we have,' said both the girls, 'but tell us...' and they
wanted to ask who the old man was, but were afraid to."
the-raspberry-worm,14,"'I will tell you who I am,' said the old man; 'I am the raspberry king,
who reigns over all this kingdom of raspberry bushes, and I have lived
here for more than a thousand years. But the great spirit who rules over
the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of
my royal power and my long life. Therefore he decreed that one day in
every hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and
live in that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. During that
time my life is dependent on the little worm's life, so that a bird can
eat me, a child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my
thousand years of life. Now yesterday was just my transformation day,
and I was taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death
if you had not saved my life. Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass,
and when I was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and
my mouth became crooked with terror; but when evening came and I could
take my own form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you.
Then I found you both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as
well as I could without frightening you. Now I will send a bird from my
wood to show you the way home. Good-bye, little children, thank you
for your kind hearts; the raspberry king can show that he is not
ungrateful.'"
the-raspberry-worm,15,"The children shook hands with the old man and thanked him,
feeling very glad that they had saved the little raspberry worm. They
were just going when the old man turned round, smiled mischievously with
his crooked mouth, and said: 'Greetings to Otto from me, and tell him
when I meet him again I shall do him the honour of eating him up.'"
the-raspberry-worm,16,"'Oh, please don't do that,' cried both the girls, very frightened.

'Well, for your sake I will forgive him,' said the old man, 'I am not
revengeful. Greetings to Otto and tell him that he may expect a gift
from me, too. Good-bye.'

The two girls, light of heart, now took their berries and ran off
through the wood after the bird; and soon it began to get lighter in the
wood and they wondered how they could have lost their way yesterday, it
seemed so easy and plain now."
the-raspberry-worm,17,"One can imagine what joy there was when the two reached home. Everyone
had been looking for them, and the big sister had not been able to
sleep, for she thought the wolves had eaten them up.

Otto met them; he had a basket in his hand and said: 'Look, here is
something that an old man has just left for you.'

When the girls looked into the basket they saw a pair of most beautiful
bracelets of precious stones, dark red, and made in the shape of a ripe
raspberry and with an inscription: 'To Lisa and Aina'; beside them there
was a diamond breast pin in the shape of a raspberry worm: on it was
inscribed 'Otto, never destroy the helpless!'"
the-raspberry-worm,18,"Otto felt rather ashamed: he quite understood what it meant, but he
thought that the old man's revenge was a noble one.

The raspberry king had also remembered the big sister, for when she went
in to set the table for dinner, she found eleven big baskets of most
beautiful raspberries, and no one knew how they had come there, but
everyone guessed.

And so there was such a jam-making as had never been seen before, and if
you like to go and help in it, you might perhaps get a little, for they
must surely be making jam still to this very day."
the-red-swan,1,"Three brothers were left destitute, by the death of their parents, at an
early age. The eldest was not yet able to provide fully for their
support, but he did all that he could in hunting. With this aid, and
the stock of provisions already laid by in the lodge, they managed to
keep along. They had no neighbors to lend them a helping hand, for the
father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe, and
had lived ever since in a solitary place. The lads had no idea that
there was a human being near them. They did not even know who their
parents had been. At the time of their death, the eldest was too
young to remember it.

Forlorn as they were, they however kept a good heart, and making use of
every chance, in course of time they all acquired a knowledge of hunting
and the pursuit of game. The eldest became expert in the craft of the
forest, and he was very successful in procuring food. He was noted for
his skill in killing buffalo, elk, and moose. He instructed his
brothers, so that each should become a master over a particular animal
which was assigned to him."
the-red-swan,2,"After they had become able to hunt and to take care of themselves, the
elder proposed to leave them and to go in search of the world, promising
to return as soon as he could procure them wives. In this intention he
was overruled by his brothers, who said that they could not part with
him.

Jeekewis, the second, was loud in disapproval of the scheme, saying:
""What will you do with those you propose to get? We have lived so long
by ourselves, we can still do without them."" This counsel prevailed, and
for a time the three brothers continued together.

One day they agreed to kill each a male of that kind of animal, which
each was most expert in hunting, for the purpose of making quivers from
their skins. When these quivers were prepared, they were straightway
filled, with arrows. They all had a presentiment that something was
about to happen which called upon them to be ready."
the-red-swan,3,"Soon after they hunted on a wager to see who should come in first with
game, and have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others.
They were to shoot no other beast or bird than such as each was in the
habit of killing.

They set out on different paths. Maidwa, the youngest, had not gone far
before he saw a bear, an animal he was not to kill, by the agreement.
He, however, followed him closely, and driving an arrow through and
through him, he brought him to the ground.

Although contrary to the engagement with his brothers, Maidwa commenced
skinning him, when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him.
He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps deceived. But rub as hard as
he would, the red hue still crimsoned the air, and tinged every object
that he looked on--the tree-tops, the river that flowed, and the deer
that glided away along the edge of the forest--with its delicate
splendor."
the-red-swan,4,"As he stood musing on this fairy spectacle, a strange noise came to his
ear from a distance. At first it seemed like a human voice. After
following the sound he reached the shore of a lake. Floating at a
distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful Red Swan, whose plumage
glittered in the sun, and when it lifted up its neck, it uttered the
peculiar tone he had heard. He was within long bow-shot, and, drawing
the arrow to his ear, he took a careful aim and discharged the shaft. It
took no effect. The beautiful bird sat proudly on the water, still
pouring forth its peculiar chant, and still spreading the radiance of
its plumage far and wide, and lighting up the whole world, beneath the
eye of Maidwa, with its ruby splendors.

He shot again and again, till his quiver was empty, for he longed to
possess so glorious a creature. Still the swan did not spread its wings
to fly, but, circling round and round, stretched its long neck and
dipped its bill into the water, as if indifferent to mortal shafts.

Maidwa ran home, and bringing all the arrows in the lodge, shot them
away. He then stood with his bow dropped at his side, lost in wonder,
gazing at the beautiful bird."
the-red-swan,5,"While standing thus, with a heart beating more and more eagerly every
moment for the possession of this fair swan, Maidwa remembered the
saying of his elder brother, that in their deceased father's
medicine-sack were three magic arrows. His brother had not told
Maidwa that their father, on his death-bed, which he alone had attended,
had especially bequeathed the arrows to his youngest son, Maidwa, from
whom they had been wrongfully kept. The thought of the magic arrows put
heart in Maidwa, and he hastened with all speed to secure them.

At any other time he would have shrunk from opening his father's
medicine-sack, but something prompted him to believe that there was no
wrong now. Snatching them forth he ran back, not staying to restore
the other contents to the sack, but leaving them scattered, here and
there, about the lodge.

He feared, as he returned, that the swan must by this time have taken
wing. But, as he emerged from the wood, to his great delight the air was
as rosy as ever, and there, in her own serene and beautiful way, still
sat the glorious Red Swan.

With trembling hand he shot the first of his magic shafts: it grazed a
wing. The second came closer, and cut away a few of the bright red
feathers, which fluttered and fell like flakes of fire in the water. The
third, which he carefully aimed and drew home upon the string with all
his force, made the lucky hit, and passed through the neck of the bird a
little above the breast."
the-red-swan,6,"""The bird is mine,"" said Maidwa, to himself. But to his great surprise,
instead of seeing it droop its neck and drift to the shore, the Red Swan
flapped its wings, rose slowly, and flew off with a majestic motion
toward the falling sun.

Maidwa, that he might meet his brothers, rescued two of the magic arrows
from the water; and although the third was borne off, he had a hope yet
to recover that too, and to be master of the swan. He was noted for his
speed; for he would shoot an arrow and then run so fast that the arrow
always fell behind him; and he now set off at his best speed of foot. ""I
can run fast,"" he thought, ""and I can get up with the swan some time or
other.""

He sped on, over hills and prairies, toward the west, and was only
going to take one more run, and then seek a place to sleep for the
night, when, suddenly, he heard noises at a distance, like the murmur of
waters against the shore. As he went on, he heard voices, and presently
he saw people, some of whom were busy felling trees, and the strokes of
their labor echoed through the woods. He passed on, and when he emerged
from the forest, the sun was just falling below the edge of the sky."
the-red-swan,7,"He was bent on success in pursuit of the swan, whose red track he marked
well far westward till she was lost to sight. Meanwhile he would tarry
for the night and procure something to eat, as he had fasted since he
had left home.

At a distance, on a rising ground, he could see the lodges of a large
village. He went toward it, and soon heard the watchman, who was set on
a height to overlook the place, and give notice of the approach of
friends or foes, crying out, ""We are visited;"" and a loud halloo
indicated that they had all heard it.

When Maidwa advanced, the watchman pointed to the lodge of the chief.
""It is there you must go in,"" he said, and left him.

""Come in, come in,"" said the chief; ""take a seat there;"" pointing to the
side of the lodge where his daughter sat. ""It is there you must sit.""

They gave him something to eat, and, being a stranger, very few
questions were put to him. It was only when he spoke that the others
answered him.

""Daughter,"" said the chief, as soon as the night had set in, ""take our
son-in-law's moccasins and see if they be torn. If so, mend them for
him, and bring in his bundle."""
the-red-swan,8,"Maidwa thought it strange that he should be so warmly received, and
married instantly against his own wishes, although he could not help
noticing that the chief's daughter was pretty.

It was some time before she would take the moccasins which he had laid
off. It displeased him to see her reluctant to do so. When at last she
did reach them, he snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself.
He lay down and thought of the swan, and made up his mind to be off with
the dawn. He wakened early, and finding the chief's daughter looking
forth at the door, he spoke to her, but she gave no answer. He touched
her lightly.

""What do you want?"" she said, and turned her face away from him.

""Tell me,"" said Maidwa, ""what time the swan passed. I am following it;
come out, and point the way.""

""Do you think you can overtake it?"" she said.

""Yes,"" he answered.

""Naubesah--fool!"" retorted the chief's pretty daughter.

She, however, went out, and pointed in the direction he should go. The
young man paced slowly along till the sun arose, when he commenced
traveling at his accustomed speed. He passed the day in running, and
although he could not see anywhere on the horizon the Red Swan, he
thought that he discerned a faint red light far over in the west."
the-red-swan,9,"When night came, he was pleased to find himself near another village.
When at a distance he heard the watchman crying out, ""We are
visited!"" and soon the men of the village stood out to see the stranger.

He was again told to enter the lodge of the chief, and his reception was
in every respect the same as on the previous night. Except that the
young woman was more beautiful, and that she entertained him very
kindly. Although urged to stay with them, the mind of Maidwa was fixed
on the object of his journey.

Before daybreak he asked the young woman at what time the Red Swan
passed, and to point out the way. She marked against the sky with her
finger the course it had taken, and told him that it had passed
yesterday when the sun was between mid-day and its falling-place.

Maidwa again set out rather slowly, but when the sun had risen, he tried
his speed by shooting an arrow ahead, and running after it. But it fell
behind him, and he knew that he had lost nothing of his quickness of
foot.

Nothing remarkable happened through the day, and he went on leisurely.
Some time after dark, as he was peering around the country for a
shelter, he saw a light emitted from a small low lodge. He went up to it
very slyly, and, peeping through the door, he discovered an old man
alone, with his head down upon his breast, warming his back before the
fire."
the-red-swan,10,"Maidwa thought that the old man did not know that he was standing near
the door. In this he was mistaken. Without turning his eyes to
look at him, the old man said, ""Walk in, my grandchild. Take a seat
opposite to me, and take off your things and dry them, for you must be
fatigued. I will prepare you something to eat, and you shall have
something very delicate.""

Maidwa accepted this kind invitation, and entered the lodge. The old man
then remarked, as if in mere course of conversation: ""My kettle with
water stands near the fire."" Immediately a small earthen pot with
legs appeared by the fire. He then took one grain of corn, also one of
whortleberry, and put them in the pot.

Maidwa was very hungry, and seeing the limited scale of the old man's
housekeeping, he thought his chance for a supper was very slight. The
old man had promised him something very delicate, and he seemed likely
to keep his word. Maidwa looked on silently, and did not change his face
any more than if the greatest banquet that was ever spread had been
going forward.

The pot soon boiled, when the old man said in a very quiet way:

""The pot will stand at a distance from the fire."""
the-red-swan,11,"It removed itself, and the old man added to Maidwa:

""My grandchild, feed yourself;"" handing him at the same time a dish and
ladle of the same ware as the pot itself.

The young man, whose hunger was very great, helped himself to all that
was in the pot. He felt ashamed to think that he had done so, but before
he could speak the old man said:

""Eat, nay grandchild. Eat, eat!"" and soon after he again said--""Help
yourself from the pot.""

Maidwa was surprised, on dipping in his ladle, to see that it was full.
Although he emptied it a second time, it was still again filled and
refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied. The old man then
observed, without raising his voice:

""The pot will return to its corner;"" and the pot took itself off to its
accustomed place in an out-of-the-way corner of the lodge.

Maidwa observed that the old man was about to address him, and took an
attitude which showed that he was prepared to listen."
the-red-swan,12,"""Keep on, my grandchild,"" said the old man. ""You will surely gain that
you seek. To tell you more I am not permitted, but go on as you have
begun and you will not be disappointed. To-morrow you will again reach
one of my fellow old men, but the one you will see after him will tell
you all, and the manner in which you must proceed to accomplish your
journey. Often has this Red Swan passed, and those who have followed it
have never returned. You must be firm in your resolution, and be
prepared for all that may happen.""

""So will it be,"" answered Maidwa; and they both laid down to sleep.

Early in the morning the old man ordered his magic kettle to prepare
breakfast, so that his guest might eat before leaving. As Maidwa passed
out, the old man gave him a blessing with his parting advice.

Maidwa set forth in better spirits than at any time since he had
started. Night again found him in company with an old man who
entertained him kindly, with a frisky little kettle which hurried up to
the fire before it was spoken to, bustled about and set his supper
briskly before Maidwa, and frisked away again, without waiting for
orders. The old man also carefully directed him on his way in the
morning."
the-red-swan,13,"He traveled with a light heart, as he now expected to meet the one who
was to give him directions how to proceed to get the Red Swan.

Toward night-fall Maidwa reached the lodge of the third old man. Before
coming to the door he heard him saying:

""Grandchild, come in;"" and going in promptly he felt quite at home.

The old man prepared him something to eat, acting as the other magicians
had done, and his kettle was of the same size, and looked as if it were
an own brother of the two others which had feasted him. Except that this
kettle, in coming and going about its household duties, would make a
passing remark, or sing a little tune for itself.

The old man waited until Maidwa had fully satisfied his hunger, when he
addressed him:"
the-red-swan,14,"Young man, the errand you are bound on is beset with trials and
difficulties. Numbers have passed with the same purpose as that which
now prompts you, but they never returned. Be careful, and if your
guardian spirits are powerful you may succeed. This Red Swan you are
following is the daughter of a magician who has abundance of every
thing, but only this one child, whom he values more than the sacred
arrows. In former times he wore a cap of wampum, which was attached to
his scalp. But powerful Indians, warriors of a distant chief, came and
told him that their chief's daughter was on the brink of the grave, and
that she herself requested his wampum-cap, which she was confident would
save her life. 'If I can only see it,' she said, 'I will recover.' It
was for this cap they had come, and after long solicitation the magician
at length consented to part with it, in the hope that it would restore
to health the dying maiden, although when he took it off to hand it to
the messengers it left the crown of his head bare and bloody. Years have
passed since, and it has not healed. The coming of the warriors to
procure it for the sick maiden was a cheat, and they are now constantly
making sport of the unhappy scalp--dancing it about from village to
village--and on every insult it receives the poor old chief to whom it
belongs groans with pain."
the-red-swan,15,"Those who hold it are too powerful for the
magician, and many have sacrificed themselves to recover it for him, but
without success. The Red Swan has enticed many a young man, as she has
you, to enlist them to procure the scalp, and whoever is so fortunate as
to succeed, it is understood, will receive the Red Swan as his reward.
In the morning you will proceed on your way, and toward evening you will
come to this magician's lodge. You will know it by the groans which you
will hear far over the prairie as you approach. He will ask you in. You
will see no one but himself. He will question you much as to your dreams
and the strength of your guardian spirits. If he is satisfied with your
answers, he will urge you to attempt the recovery of his scalp. He will
show you the course to take, and if you feel inclined, as I see that
you do, go forward, my son, with a strong heart; persevere, and I have a
presentiment that you will succeed."
the-red-swan,16,"Maidwa answered, ""I will try.""

Betimes in the morning, after having eaten from the magic kettle, which
sung a sort of farewell chant on its way from the fire-place to its
station in the corner, he set off on his journey.

Toward evening, Maidwa, as he crossed a prairie, heard, as had been
predicted, groans from a distant lodge, which were only interrupted by a
voice from a person whom he could not see, calling to him aloud:

""Come in! come in!""

On entering the lodge, the magician heaved a great groan from the very
bottom of his chest, and Maidwa saw that the crown of his head was all
bare and bloody.

""Sit down, sit down,"" he said, ""while I prepare you something to eat.
You see how poor I am. I have to attend to all my own wants, with no
other servant than that poor little kettle in the corner. Kettle, we
will have something to eat, if you please.""

""In a moment,"" the kettle spoke up from the corner.

""You will oblige me by making all the dispatch you can,"" said the
magician, in a very humble tone, still addressing the kettle.

""Have patience,"" replied the kettle, ""and I will be with you presently.""

After a considerable delay, there came forward out of the corner from
which it had spoken, a great heavy-browed and pot-bodied kettle, which
advanced with much stateliness and solemnity of manner till it had come
directly in front of the magician, whom it addressed with the question:

""What shall we have, sir?""

""Corn, if you please,"" the magician answered.

""No, we will have whortleberries,"" rejoined the kettle, in a firm voice.

""Very well; just as you choose.""

When he supposed it was time, the magician invited Maidwa to help
himself."
the-red-swan,17,"""Hold a minute,"" interposed the kettle, as Maidwa was about to dip in
his ladle. He paused, and after a delay, the kettle, shaking itself up
and simmering very loudly, said, ""Now we are ready.""

Maidwa fell to and satisfied his hunger.

""Will the kettle now withdraw?"" asked the magician, with am air of much
deference.

""No,"" said the kettle, ""we will stay and hear what the young man has to
say for himself.""

""Very well,"" said the magician. ""You see,"" he added to Maidwa, ""how poor
I am. I have to take counsel with the kettle, or I should be all alone,
without a day's food, and with no one to advise me.""

All this time the Red Swan was carefully concealed in the lodge, behind
a curtain, from which Maidwa heard now and then a rustling noise, that
fluttered his spirits and set his heart to beating at a wonderful rate.

As soon as Maidwa had partaken of food and laid aside his leggings and
moccasins, the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his
scalp, the insults it was receiving, the pain he suffered thereby, his
wishes to regain it, the many unsuccessful attempts that had already
been made, and the numbers and power of those who retained it. He would
interrupt his discourse, at times, with sudden groans, and say:

""Oh, how shamefully they are treating it.""

Maidwa listened to all the old magician had to say with solemn
attention.

The magician renewed his discourse, and inquired of Maidwa as to his
dreams, or what he saw in his sleep, at such times as he had fasted and
darkened his face to procure guardian spirits.

Maidwa then told him one dream. The magician groaned.

""No, that is not it,"" he said."
the-red-swan,18,"Maidwa told him of two or three others.

The magician groaned again and again, and said, rather peevishly, ""No,
these are not the dreams.""

""Keep cool,"" said the kettle, which had left the fire, and was standing
in the middle of the floor, where a pleasant breeze was blowing through
the lodge, and added, ""Have you no more dreams of another kind?""

""Yes,"" said Maidwa; and he told him one.

""That will do,"" said the kettle. ""We are much pleased with that.""

""Yes, that is it--that is it!"" the magician added. ""You will cause me to
live. That was what I was wishing you to say. Will you then go and see
if you can not recover my poor scalp?""

""Yes,"" said Maidwa, ""I will go; and the day after to-morrow, when you
hear the ka-kak cries of the hawk, you will know that I am successful.
You must prepare your head, and lean it out through the door, so that
the moment I arrive I may place your scalp on.""

""Yes, yes,"" said the magician. ""As you say it will be done.""

Early the next morning Maidwa set out to fulfill his promise; and in the
afternoon, when the sun hangs toward home, he heard the shouts of a
great many people. He was in a wood at the time, and saw, as he thought,
only a few men, but as he went on they increased in numbers. On emerging
upon the plain, their heads appeared like the hanging leaves, they were
so many."
the-red-swan,19,"In the middle of the plain he perceived a post, and something waving at
its top. It was the wampum scalp; and every now and then the air was
rent with the war-song, for they were dancing the war-dance in high
spirit around it.

Before he could be observed, Maidwa changed himself into a humming-bird,
and flew toward the scalp. As he passed some of those who were standing
by, he came close to their ears, and as they heard the rapid whirr or
murmur which this bird makes when it flies, they jumped aside, and asked
each other what it could be. Maidwa had nearly reached the scalp, but
fearing that he should be perceived while untying it, he again changed
himself into the down that floats lightly on the air, and sailed slowly
on to the scalp. He loosened it, and moved off heavily, as the weight
was almost too great for him to bear up. The Indians around would have
snatched it away had not a lucky current of air just then buoyed him up.
As they saw that it was moving away they cried out, ""It is taken from
us! it is taken from us!"""
the-red-swan,20,"Maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads; and as
they followed him, the rush and hum of the people was like the dead
beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm. But the good wind
gaining strength, soon carried him beyond their pursuit. A little
further on he changed himself into a hawk, and flew swiftly off with
his trophy, crying, ""Ka-kak! ka-kak!"" till it resounded with its shrill
tone through the whole country, far and wide.

Meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of Maidwa,
placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka-kak cry
of the hawk.

In a moment Maidwa came past with rustling wings, and as he flew by,
giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp, his
limbs extended and quivered in an agony, the scalp adhered, and Maidwa,
in his own person, walked into the lodge and sat down, feeling perfectly
at home.

The magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had
been dealt him, that Maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his
head he had destroyed his life. Presently, however, he was pleased to
see him show, by the motion of his hands and limbs, that his strength
was returning; and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet.
What was the delight of Maidwa to behold, instead of a withered old man,
far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow, a bright and cheerful
youth, who glittered with life as he stood up before him."
the-red-swan,21,"""Thank you, my friend,"" he said. ""Your kindness and bravery of heart
have restored me to my former shape. It was so ordained, and you have
now accomplished the victory.""

They embraced; and the young magician urged the stay of his deliverer
for a few days, and they formed a strong attachment to each other. The
magician, to the deep regret of Maidwa, never once alluded to the Red
Swan in all their conferences.

At last the day arrived when Maidwa prepared to return to his home. The
young magician bestowed on him ample presents of wampum, fur, robes, and
other costly things. Although Maidwa's heart was burning within him to
see the Red Swan, to hear her spoken of, and to learn what his fortune
was to be in regard to that fond object of his pursuit, he constrained
his feelings, and so checked his countenance as to never look where he
supposed she might be. His friend the young magician observed the same
silence and caution."
the-red-swan,22,"Maidwa's pack for traveling was now ready, and he was taking his
farewell smoke, when the young magician thus addressed him: ""My friend
Maidwa, you know for what cause you came thus far, and why you have
risked so much and waited so long. You have proved my friend indeed. You
have accomplished your object, and your noble perseverance shall not go
unrewarded. If you undertake other things with the same spirit, you will
always succeed. My destiny compels me to remain where I am, although I
should feel happy to be allowed to go with you. I have given you, of
ordinary gifts, all you will need as long as you live; but I see you
are backward to speak of the Red Swan. I vowed that whoever procured me
my lost wampum-scalp should be rewarded by possessing the Red Swan.""

He then spoke in a language which Maidwa did not understand, the curtain
of the lodge parted, and the Red Swan met his gaze. It was a beautiful
female that he beheld, so majestical and airy in her look, that he
seemed to see a creature whose home should rather be in the free heaven,
and among the rosy clouds, than in this dusky lodge.

""Take her,"" the young magician said; ""she is my sister; treat her well.
She is worthy of you, and what you have done for me merits more. She is
ready to go with you to your kindred and friends, and has been so ever
since your arrival; and my good wishes shall go with you both.""

The Red Swan smiled kindly on Maidwa, who advanced and greeted her. Hand
in hand they took their way forth from the lodge, and, watched by the
young magician, advanced across the prairie on their homeward course."
the-red-swan,23,"They traveled slowly, and looked with double joy on the beautiful
country over which they had both so lately passed with hearts ill at
ease.

After two or three days they reached the lodge of the third old man who
had entertained him with the singing kettle; but the kettle was not
there. The old man, nevertheless, received them very kindly, and said
to Maidwa, ""You see what your perseverance has secured you; do so
always, and you will succeed in whatever you undertake.""

On the following morning, when they were about to start, he pulled from
the side of the lodge a bag, which he presented to Maidwa, saying,
""Grandchild, I give you this; it contains a present for you; and I hope
you will live happily till old age.""

Bidding him farewell, they again set forward; and they soon came to the
second old man's lodge; he also gave them a present and bestowed his
blessing. Nor did Maidwa see any thing here of the frisky little kettle
which had been so lively on his former visit."
the-red-swan,24,"As they went on and came to the lodge of the first old man, their
reception and farewell were the same; and when Maidwa glanced to the
corner, the silent kettle, which had been the first acquaintance he had
made in that family on his travels, was not there. The old man smiled
when he discovered the direction of Maidwa's glance, but he said
nothing.

When, on continuing their journey, they at last approached the first
town which Maidwa had passed in his pursuit, the watchman gave notice as
before, and he was shown into the chief's lodge.

""Sit down there, son-in-law,"" said the chief, pointing to a place near
his daughter. ""And you also,"" he said to the Red Swan.

The chief's daughter was engaged in coloring a girdle, and, as if
indifferent to these visitors, she did not even raise her head.
Presently the chief said, ""Let some one bring in the bundle of our
son-in-law."""
the-red-swan,25,"When the bundle was laid before him, Maidwa opened one of the bags which
had been given to him. It was filled with various costly
articles--wampum, robes, and trinkets, of much richness and value;
these, in token of his kindness, he presented to the chief. The chief's
daughter stole a glance at the costly gifts, then at Maidwa and his
beautiful wife. She stopped working, and was silent and thoughtful all
the evening. The chief himself talked with Maidwa of his adventures,
congratulated him on his good fortune, and concluded by telling him that
he should take his daughter along with him in the morning.

Maidwa said ""Yes.""

The chief then spoke up, saying, ""Daughter, be ready to go with him in
the morning.""

Now it happened when the chief was thus speaking that there was a
foolish fellow in the lodge, who had thought to have got this chief's
daughter for a wife; and he jumped up, saying:

""Who is he,"" looking grimly at Maidwa, ""that he should take her for a
few presents? I will kill him.""

And he raised a knife which he had in his hand, and gave it a mighty
flourish in the air. He kept up this terrible flourish till some one
came and pulled him back to his seat, which he had been waiting for,
and then he sat quiet enough."
the-red-swan,26,"Amid the greetings of their new friends, Maidwa and the Red Swan, with
the chief's daughter, took their leave by peep of day, and toward
evening they reached the other town. The watchman gave the signal, and
numbers of men, women and children stood out to see them. They were
again shown into the chief's lodge, who welcomed him, saying:

""Son-in-law, you are welcome.""

And he requested Maidwa to take a seat by his daughter, and the two
women did the same.

After suitable refreshment for all, and while Maidwa smoked a pipe, the
chief asked him to relate his adventures in the hearing of all the
inmates of the lodge, and of the strangers who had gathered in at report
of his singular fortunes.

Maidwa gave them his whole story. When he came to those parts which
related to the Red Swan, they turned and looked upon her in wonder and
admiration, for she was very beautiful.

The chief then informed Maidwa that his brothers had been to their town
in search of him, but that they had gone back some time before, having
given up all hopes of ever seeing him again. He added, that since he had
shown himself a man of spirit, whom fortune was pleased to befriend, he
should take his daughter with him."
the-red-swan,27,"""For although your brothers,"" he said, ""were here, they were too bashful
to enter any of our lodges. They merely inquired for you and returned.
You will take my daughter, treat her well, and that will bind us more
closely together.""

It is always the case in an assembly or gathering that some one of the
number is foolish, and disposed to play the clown. It happened to be so
here. One of this very sort was in the lodge, and, after Maidwa had
given the old chief presents, as he had to the other, this pretender
jumped up in a passion, and cried out:

""Who is this stranger, that he should have her? I want her myself.""

The chief bade him be quiet, and not to disturb or quarrel with one who
was enjoying their hospitality.

""No, no,"" he exclaimed, rushing forward as in act to strike.

Maidwa sat unmoved, and paid no heed to his threats.

He cried the louder--""I will have her, I will have her!"" whereupon the
old chief, being now vexed past patience, took his great war-club and
tapped this clownish fellow upon the head, which so far subdued him that
he sat for some time quite still; when, after a while, he came to
himself, the chief upbraided him for his folly, and told him to go out
and tell stories to the old women."
the-red-swan,28,"When at last Maidwa was about to leave, he invited a number of the
families of the chief to go with him and visit their hunting-grounds,
where he promised them that they would find game in abundance. They
consented, and in the morning a large company assembled and joined
Maidwa; and the chief, with a party of warriors, escorted them a long
distance. When ready to return, the chief made a speech and besought the
blessing of the Good Spirit on Maidwa and his friends.

They parted, each on its course, making music with their war-drums,
which could be heard from afar as they glittered with waving feathers in
the morning sun, in their march over the prairie, which was lost in the
distant sky.

After several days' travel, Maidwa and his friends came in sight of his
home. The others rested within the woods while he went alone in advance
to see his brothers."
the-red-swan,29,"He entered the lodge. It was all in confusion and covered with ashes. On
one side, sitting among the cinders, with his face blackened, and crying
aloud, was his elder brother. On the other side sat the younger,
Jeekewis, also with blackened face, his head covered with stray feathers
and tufts of swan-down. This one presented so curious a figure that
Maidwa could not keep from laughing. He seemed to be so lost and
far-gone in grief that he could not notice his brother's arrival. The
eldest, however, after a while, lifting up his head, recognized Maidwa,
jumped up and shook hands, and kissed him, and expressed much joy at his
return.

Maidwa, as soon as he had seen the lodge set in order, made known that
he had brought each of them a wife. As soon as Jeekewis heard a wife
spoken of, he roused from his torpor, sprang to his feet, and said:

""Why is it just now that you have come?"" and at once made for the door
and peeped out to see the strangers. He then commenced jumping and
laughing, and crying out, ""Women! women!"" and that was all the reception
he gave his brother. Maidwa told them to wash themselves and prepare,
for he would go and fetch the females in."
the-red-swan,30,"Jeekewis scampered about, and began to wash himself; but he would every
now and then, with one side of his head all feathers, and the other
clear and shining, peep forth to look at the women again. When they came
near, he said, ""I will have this and that one;"" he did not exactly know
which; he would sit down for an instant, and then rise, and peep about
and laugh; in fact he acted like one beside himself.

As soon as order was restored, and all the company who had been brought
in were seated, Maidwa presented one of the chief's daughters to his
eldest brother, saying: ""These women were given to me, to dispose of in
marriage. I now give one to each. I intended so from the first.""

Jeekewis spoke up and said, ""I think three wives would have been enough
for you.""

Maidwa led the other daughter to Jeekewis, and said, ""My brother, here
is one for you, and live happily.""

Jeekewis hung down his head as if he was ashamed, but he would every now
and then steal a look at his wife and also at the other women.

By and by he turned toward his wife and acted as if he had been married
for years."
the-red-swan,31,"Maidwa seeing that no preparation had been made to entertain the
company, said, ""Are we to have no supper?""

He had no sooner spoken, than forth from a corner stepped the silent
kettle, which placed itself by the fire, and began bubbling and boiling
quite briskly. Presently that was joined by the big talking kettle,
which said, addressing itself to Maidwa, ""Master, we shall be ready
presently;"" and then, dancing along, came, from still another, the
frisky little kettle, which hopped to their side, and took an active
part in the preparations for the evening meal. When all was nearly
ready, a delicate voice was heard singing in the last corner of the
lodge, and keeping up its dainty carol all the way to the fire-place,
the fourth kettle joined the three cooks, and they all fell to with all
their might, and in the best possible humor, to dispatch their work.

It was not long before the big kettle advanced toward Maidwa, and said,
in his own confident way, ""Supper is ready!""

The feast was a jovial one; and although they were all hungry, and plied
their ladles with right good will, yet, dip in as often as they would,
the four magic kettles held out, and had plenty to the end of the revel.

To draw to a close, Maidwa and his friends lived in peace for a time;
their town prospered; there was no lack of children; and every thing
else was in abundance."
the-red-swan,32,"One day the two brothers began to look dark upon Maidwa, and to reproach
him for having taken from the medicine-sack their deceased father's
magic arrows; they upbraided him especially that one was lost.

After listening to them in silence, he said that he would go in search
of it, and that it should be restored; and the very next day, true to
his word, he left them.

After traveling a long way, and looking in every direction, almost
hopeless of discovering the lost treasure, he came to an opening in the
earth, and descending, it led him to the abode of departed spirits. The
country appeared beautiful, the pastures were greener than his own, and
the sky bluer than that which hung over the lodge, and the extent of it
was utterly lost in a dim distance; and he saw animals of every kind
wandering about in great numbers. The first he came to were buffalos;
his surprise was great when they addressed him as human beings.

They asked him what he came for, how he had descended, and why he was so
bold as to visit the abode of the dead.

He answered that he was in quest of a magic arrow, to appease the anger
of his brothers."
the-red-swan,33,"""Very well,"" said the leader of the buffalos, whose form was nothing but
bone. ""Yes, we know it,"" and he and his followers moved off a little
space from Maidwa, as if they were afraid of him. ""You have come,""
resumed the buffalo-spirit, ""to a place where a living man has never
before been. You will return immediately to your tribe, for, under
pretense of recovering one of the magic arrows which belong to you by
your father's dying wish, they have sent you off that they might become
possessed of your beautiful wife, the Red Swan. Speed home! You will
find the magic arrow at the lodge-door. You will live to a very old age,
and die happily. You can go no further in these abodes of ours.""

Maidwa looked, as he thought, to the west, and saw a bright light as if
the sun was shining in its splendor, but he saw no sun.

""What light is that yonder?"" he asked.

The all-boned buffalo answered--""It is the place where those who were
good dwell.""

""And that dark cloud?"" Maidwa again asked.

""It is the place of the wicked,"" answered the buffalo.

Maidwa turned away, for it was very dark, and it pained his eyes to look
upon it; and, moving away by the aid of his guardian spirits, he again
stood upon the earth, and beheld the sun giving light as usual."
the-red-swan,34,"All else that he learned in the abodes of the dead, and his travels and
acts previous to his return homeward, are unknown, for he never spoke of
them to any human being.

After wandering a long time to gather knowledge to make his people happy
and to add to their comfort, he one evening drew near to his own
village. Passing all the other lodges he came to his own door, where he
found the magic arrow, as he had been promised. He heard his brothers
from within at high words with each other. They were quarreling for the
possession of his wife, who, through all his absence, had remained
constant, and sadly awaited his return. Maidwa listened in shame and
sorrow.

He entered the lodge, holding his head aloft as one conscious of good
principle and shining with anger. He spoke not a word, but, placing the
magic arrow to his bow, he would have laid his brothers dead at his
feet; but just then the talking kettle stepped forward and spoke such
words of wisdom, and the singing kettle trolled forth such a soothing
little song, and the guilty brothers were so contrite and keenly
repentant of their intended wrong, and the Red Swan was so radiant and
forgiving, the silent kettle straightway served them up so hearty and
wholesome a meal, and the frisky little kettle was so joyful and danced
about so merrily, that when the magic arrows were laid away in the
medicine-sack by Maidwa, there was that night in all the Indian country
no happier family than the three brothers, who ever after dwelt together
in all kindness, as all good brothers should."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,1,"There was once a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was
dead, the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his
property. For a long time all went well; the young man got up very early
in the morning, and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week
his father counted up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with
delight, as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was
becoming. 'It will soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger
one,' he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his
money, that he did not notice how bright his son's face had grown, nor
how he sometimes started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far
away.

One day, however, the old man went to the city on business, which he had
not done for three years at least. It was market day, and he met with
many people he knew, and it was getting quite late when he turned into
the inn yard, and bade an ostler saddle his horse, and bring it round
directly. While he was waiting in the hall, the landlady came up for a
gossip, and after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she
asked him how he liked his new daughter-in-law, and whether he had been
surprised at the marriage."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,2,"The old man stared as he listened to her. 'Daughter-in-law? Marriage?'
said he. 'I don't know what you are talking about! I've got no
daughter-in-law, and nobody has been married lately, that I ever heard
of.'

Now this was exactly what the landlady, who was very curious, wanted to
find out; but she put on a look of great alarm, and exclaimed:

'Oh, dear! I hope I have not made mischief. I had no idea--or, of
course, I would not have spoken--but'--and here she stopped and fumbled
with her apron, as if she was greatly embarrassed."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,3,"'As you have said so much you will have to say a little more,' retorted
the old man, a suspicion of what she meant darting across him; and the
woman, nothing loth, answered as before.

'Ah, it was not all for buying or selling that your handsome son has
been coming to town every week these many months past. And not by the
shortest way, either! No, it was over the river he rode, and across the
hill and past the cottage of Miguel the vine-keeper, whose daughter,
they say, is the prettiest girl in the whole country side, though she is
too white for my taste,' and then the landlady paused again, and glanced
up at the farmer, to see how he was taking it. She did not learn much.
He was looking straight before him, his teeth set. But as she ceased to
talk, he said quietly, 'Go on.'

'There is not much more to tell,' replied the landlady, for she suddenly
remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always
stopped at the inn on market days, before starting for home, 'but one
fine morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill,
and were married. My cousin is servant to the priest, and she found out
about it and told me. But good-day to you, sir; here is your horse, and
I must hurry off to the kitchen.'"
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,4,"It was lucky that the horse was sure-footed and knew the road, for his
bridle hung loose on his neck, and his master took no heed of the way
he was going. When the farm-house was reached, the man led the animal to
the stable, and then went to look for his son.

'I know everything--you have deceived me. Get out of my sight at once--I
have done with you,' he stammered, choking with passion as he came up to
the young man, who was cutting a stick in front of the door, whistling
gaily the while.

'But, father--'

'You are no son of mine; I have only one now. Begone, or it will be the
worse for you,' and as he spoke he lifted up his whip.

The young man shrank back. He feared lest his father should fall down in
a fit, his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head.
But it was no use staying: perhaps next morning the old man might listen
to reason, though in his heart the son felt that he would never take
back his words. So he turned slowly away, and walked heavily along a
path which ended in a cave on the side of his hill, and there he sat
through the night, thinking of what had happened."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,5,"Yes, he had been wrong, there was no doubt of that, and he did not quite
know how it had come about. He had meant to have told his father all
about it, and he was sure, quite sure, that if once the old man had seen
his wife, he would have forgiven her poverty on account of her great
beauty and goodness. But he had put it off from day to day, hoping
always for a better opportunity, and now this was the end!

If the son had no sleep that night, no more had the father, and as soon
as the sun rose, he sent a messenger into the great city with orders to
bring back the younger brother. When he arrived the farmer did not waste
words, but informed him that he was now his only heir, and would inherit
all his lands and money, and that he was to come and live at home, and
to help manage the property.

Though very pleased at the thought of becoming such a rich man--for the
brothers had never cared much for each other--the younger would rather
have stayed where he was, for he soon got tired of the country, and
longed for a town life. However, this he kept to himself, and made the
best of things, working hard like his brother before him."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,6,"In this way the years went on, but the crops were not so good as they
had been, and the old man gave orders that some fine houses he was
building in the city should be left unfinished, for it would take all
the savings to complete them. As to the elder son, he would never even
hear his name mentioned, and died at last without ever seeing his face,
leaving to the younger, as he had promised, all his lands, as well as
his money.

Meanwhile, the son whom he had disinherited had grown poorer and poorer.
He and his wife were always looking out for something to do, and never
spent a penny that they could help, but luck was against them, and at
the time of his father's death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes
to cover them. If there had been only himself, he would have managed
to get on somehow, but he could not bear to watch his children becoming
weaker day by day, and swallowing his pride, at length he crossed the
mountains to his old home where his brother was living."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,7,"It was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face,
and they looked at each other in silence. Then tears rose in the eyes of
the elder, but winking them hastily away, he said:

'Brother, it is not needful that I should tell you how poor I am; you
can see that for yourself. I have not come to beg for money, but only
to ask if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city,
and I will make them watertight, so that my wife and children can live
in them, and that will save our rent. For as they are, they profit you
nothing.'

And the younger brother listened and pitied him, and gave him the houses
that he asked for, and the elder went away happy."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,8,"For some years things went on as they were, and then the rich brother
began to feel lonely, and thought to himself that he was getting older,
and it was time for him to be married. The wife he chose was very
wealthy, but she was also very greedy, and however much she had, she
always wanted more. She was, besides, one of those unfortunate people
who invariably fancy that the possessions of other people must be better
than their own. Many a time her poor husband regretted the day that he
had first seen her, and often her meanness and shabby ways put him to
shame. But he had not the courage to rule her, and she only got worse
and worse.

After she had been married a few months the bride wanted to go into the
city and buy herself some new dresses. She had never been there before,
and when she had finished her shopping, she thought she would pay a
visit to her unknown sister-in-law, and rest for a bit. The house
she was seeking was in a broad street, and ought to have been very
magnificent, but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door
of rough wood, while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing. The
dwelling on each side were in the same unfinished condition, and water
trickled down the walls. Most people would have considered it a wretched
place, and turned their backs on it as soon as they could, but this lady
saw that by spending some money the houses could be made as splendid as
they were originally intended to be, and she instantly resolved to get
them for herself."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,9,"Full of this idea she walked up the marble staircase, and entered
the little room where her sister-in-law sat, making clothes for her
children. The bride seemed full of interest in the houses, and asked
a great many questions about them, so that her new relations liked her
much better than they expected, and hoped they might be good friends.
However, as soon as she reached home, she went straight to her husband,
and told him that he must get back those houses from his brother, as
they would exactly suit her, and she could easily make them into a
palace as fine as the king's. But her husband only told her that she
might buy houses in some other part of the town, for she could not have
those, as he had long since made a gift of them to his brother, who had
lived there for many years past."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,10,"At this answer the wife grew very angry. She began to cry, and made such
a noise that all the neighbours heard her and put their heads out of the
windows, to see what was the matter. 'It was absurd,' she sobbed out,
'quite unjust. Indeed, if you came to think of it, the gift was worth
nothing, as when her husband made it he was a bachelor, and since then
he had been married, and she had never given her consent to any such
thing.' And so she lamented all day and all night, till the poor man
was nearly worried to death; and at last he did what she wished, and
summoned his brother in a court of law to give up the houses which, he
said, had only been lent to him. But when the evidence on both sides had
been heard, the judge decided in favour of the poor man, which made the
rich lady more furious than ever, and she determined not to rest until
she had gained the day. If one judge would not give her the houses
another should, and so time after time the case was tried over again,
till at last it came before the highest judge of all, in the city of
Evora. Her husband was heartily tired and ashamed of the whole affair,
but his weakness in not putting a stop to it in the beginning had got
him into this difficulty, and now he was forced to go on."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,11,"On the same day the two brothers set out on their journey to the city,
the rich one on horseback, with plenty of food in his knapsack, the poor
one on foot with nothing but a piece of bread and four onions to eat
on the way. The road was hilly and neither could go very fast, and when
night fell, they were both glad to see some lights in a window a little
distance in front of them.

The lights turned out to have been placed there by a farmer, who
had planned to have a particularly good supper as it was his wife's
birthday, and bade the rich man enter and sit down, while he himself
took the horse to the stable. The poor man asked timidly if he might
spend the night in a corner, adding that he had brought his own supper
with him. Another time permission might have been refused him, for the
farmer was no lover of humble folk, but now he gave the elder brother
leave to come in, pointing out a wooden chair where he could sit.

Supper was soon served, and very glad the younger brother was to eat it,
for his long ride had made him very hungry. The farmer's wife, however,
would touch nothing, and at last declared that the only supper she
wanted was one of the onions the poor man was cooking at the fire. Of
course he gave it to her, though he would gladly have eaten it himself,
as three onions are not much at the end of a long day's walk, and soon
after they all went to sleep, the poor man making himself as comfortable
as he could in his corner."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,12,"A few hours later the farmer was aroused by the cries and groans of his
wife.

'Oh, I feel so ill, I'm sure I'm going to die,' wept she. 'It was that
onion, I know it was. I wish I had never eaten it. It must have been
poisoned.'

'If the man has poisoned you he shall pay for it,' said her husband, and
seizing a thick stick he ran downstairs and began to beat the poor
man, who had been sound asleep, and had nothing to defend himself
with. Luckily, the noise aroused the younger brother, who jumped up and
snatched the stick from the farmer's hand, saying:

'We are both going to Evora to try a law-suit. Come too, and accuse him
there if he has attempted to rob you or murder you, but don't kill him
now, or you will get yourself into trouble.'

'Well, perhaps you are right,' answered the farmer, 'but the sooner that
fellow has his deserts, the better I shall be pleased,' and without more
words he went to the stables and brought out a horse for himself and
also the black Andalusian mare ridden by the rich man, while the poor
brother, fearing more ill-treatment, started at once on foot."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,13,"Now all that night it had rained heavily, and did not seem likely to
stop, and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was
almost impossible to get across it. In one spot it was so very bad that
a mule laden with baggage had got stuck in it, and tug as he might,
his master was quite unable to pull him out. The muleteer in despair
appealed to the two horseman, who were carefully skirting the swamp at
some distance off, but they paid no heed to his cries, and he began to
talk cheerfully to his mule, hoping to keep up his spirits, declaring
that if the poor beast would only have a little patience help was sure
to come."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,14,"And so it did, for very soon the poor brother reached the place,
bespattered with mud from head to foot, but ready to do all he could
to help with the mule and his master. First they set about finding some
stout logs of wood to lay down on the marsh so that they could reach the
mule, for by this time his frantic struggles had broken his bridle, and
he was deeper in than ever. Stepping cautiously along the wood, the poor
man contrived to lay hold of the animal's tale, and with a desperate
effort the mule managed to regain his footing on dry ground, but at the
cost of leaving his tail in the poor man's hand. When he saw this the
muleteer's anger knew no bounds, and forgetting that without the help
given him he would have lost his mule altogether, he began to abuse the
poor man, declaring that he had ruined his beast, and the law would make
him pay for it. Then, jumping on the back of the mule, which was so glad
to be out of the choking mud that he did not seem to mind the loss of
his tail, the ungrateful wretch rode on, and that evening reached the
inn at Evora, where the rich man and the farmer had already arrived for
the night."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,15,"Meanwhile the poor brother walked wearily along, wondering what other
dreadful adventures were in store for him.

'I shall certainly be condemned for one or other of them,' thought he
sadly; 'and after all, if I have to die, I would rather choose my own
death than leave it to my enemies,' and as soon as he entered Evora he
looked about for a place suitable for carrying out the plan he had made.
At length he found what he sought, but as it was too late and too dark
for him to make sure of success, he curled himself up under a doorway,
and slept till morning.

Although it was winter, the sun rose in a clear sky, and its rays felt
almost warm when the poor man got up and shook himself. He intended it
to be the day of his death, but in spite of that, and of the fact
that he was leaving his wife and children behind him, he felt almost
cheerful. He had struggled so long, and was so very, very tired; but he
would not have minded that if he could have proved his innocence, and
triumphed over his enemies. However, they had all been too clever for
him, and he had no strength to fight any more. So he mounted the stone
steps that led to the battlements of the city, and stopped for a moment
to gaze about him."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,16,"It happened that an old sick man who lived near by had begged to be
carried out and to be laid at the foot of the wall so that the beams of
the rising sun might fall upon him, and he would be able to talk with
his friends as they passed by to their work. Little did he guess that
on top of the battlements, exactly over his head, stood a man who was
taking his last look at the same sun, before going to his death that
awaited him. But so it was; and as the steeple opposite was touched by
the golden light, the poor man shut his eyes and sprang forward. The
wall was high, and he flew rapidly through the air, but it was not the
ground he touched, only the body of the sick man, who rolled over and
died without a groan. As for the other, he was quite unhurt, and was
slowly rising to his feet when his arms were suddenly seized and held."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,17,"'You have killed our father, do you see? do you see?' cried two young
men, 'and you will come with us this instant before the judge, and
answer for it.'

'Your father? but I don't know him. What do you mean?' asked the poor
man, who was quite bewildered with his sudden rush through the air, and
could not think why he should be accused of this fresh crime. But he got
no reply, and was only hurried through the streets to the court-house,
where his brother, the muleteer, and the farmer had just arrived, all as
angry as ever, all talking at once, till the judge entered and ordered
them to be silent.

'I will hear you one by one,' he said, and motioned the younger brother
to begin.

He did not take long to state his case. The unfinished houses were his,
left him with the rest of the property by his father, and his brother
refused to give them up. In answer, the poor man told, in a few words,
how he had begged the houses from his brother, and produced the deed of
gift which made him their owner.

The judge listened quietly and asked a few questions; then he gave his
verdict."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,18,"'The houses shall remain the property of the man to whom they were
given, and to whom they belong. And as you,' he added, turning to the
younger brother, 'brought this accusation knowing full well it was
wicked and unjust, I order you, besides losing the houses, to pay a
thousand pounds damages to your brother.'

The rich man heard the judge with rage in his heart, the poor man with
surprise and gratitude. But he was not safe yet, for now it was the turn
of the farmer. The judge could hardly conceal a smile at the story,
and inquired if the wife was dead before the farmer left the house, and
received for answer that he was in such a hurry for justice to be done
that he had not waited to see. Then the poor man told his tale, and once
more judgment was given in his favour, while twelve hundred pounds
was ordered to be paid him. As for the muleteer, he was informed very
plainly that he had proved himself mean and ungrateful for the help that
had been given him, and as a punishment he must pay to the poor man a
fine of fifty pounds, and hand him over the mule till his tail had grown
again.

Lastly, there came the two sons of the sick man."
the-rich-brother-and-the-poor-brother,19,"'This is the wretch who killed our father,' they said, 'and we demand
that he should die also.'

'How did you kill him?' asked the judge, turning to the accused, and the
poor man told how he had leaped from the wall, not knowing that anyone
was beneath.

'Well, this is my judgment,' replied the judge, when they had all
spoken: 'Let the accused sit under the wall, and let the sons of the
dead man jump from the top and fall on him and kill him, and if they
will not to this, then they are condemned to pay eight hundred pounds
for their false accusation.'

The young men looked at each other, and slowly shook their heads.

'We will pay the fine,' said they, and the judge nodded.

So the poor man rode the mule home, and brought back to his family
enough money to keep them in comfort to the end of their days."
the-roly-poly-pudding,1,"ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who
was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and
whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!

On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.

She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.

Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.
She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best
spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right
upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him
anywhere."
the-roly-poly-pudding,2,"It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the
walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside
them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there
were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared
at night--especially cheese and bacon.

Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.

While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got
into mischief.

The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.

They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before
the fire.

They patted it with their little soft paws--""Shall we make dear little
muffins?"" said Mittens to Moppet."
the-roly-poly-pudding,3,"But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet
jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.

Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone
shelf where the milk pans stand.

The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some
yeast.

Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--""Come in, Cousin Ribby,
come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,"" said
Tabitha, shedding tears. ""I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the
rats have got him."" She wiped her eyes with an apron."
the-roly-poly-pudding,4,"""He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best
bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?""

""All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to
have an unruly family!"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.

""I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too!
What is all that soot in the fender?""

""The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and
Mittens are gone!""

""They have both got out of the cup-board!"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,5,"Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They
poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in
cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest
in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard
a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.

""Yes, it is infested with rats,"" said Tabitha tearfully, ""I caught seven
young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for
dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old
rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his
yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.""

""The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha.

Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious
roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen."
the-roly-poly-pudding,6,"They returned to the kitchen. ""Here's one of your kittens at least,""
said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.

They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She
seemed to be in a terrible fright.

""Oh! Mother, Mother,"" said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the
kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!""

The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks
of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!

""Which way did she go, Moppet?""

But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.

Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while
they went on with their search."
the-roly-poly-pudding,7,"They went into the dairy.

The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.

They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.

""Oh, Mother, Mother!"" said Mittens--

""Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a
dreadful enormous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and
the rolling-pin.""

Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.

""A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!"" exclaimed Tabitha,
wringing her paws.

""A rolling-pin?"" said Ribby. ""Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the
attic when we were looking into that chest?"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,8,"Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise
was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.

""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby. ""We must send for John
Joiner at once, with a saw.""

Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very
unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does
not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.

Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that
his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.

He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the
chimney.

The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a
white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender
and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fireplace."
the-roly-poly-pudding,9,"The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk
about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.

He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron
bar where the kettle hangs.

Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high
up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.

Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks
beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up
his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try
to catch sparrows.

""I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my
beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.""

The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days
when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.

The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and
the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that
kept out the rain."
the-roly-poly-pudding,10,"Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.

Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little
sweep himself.

It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.

There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.

He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to
a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some
mutton bones lying about--

""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten. ""Who has been gnawing bones up here
in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is
something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,"" said
Tom Kitten.

He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a
most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.

He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the
skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the
picture."
the-roly-poly-pudding,11,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed
on a heap of very dirty rags.

When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself
in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his
life in the house.

It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and
cobwebs, and lath and plaster.

Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.

""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" said
the rat, chattering his teeth.

""Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten.

""Anna Maria! Anna Maria!"" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise
and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.

All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was
happening--

His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with
string in very hard knots."
the-roly-poly-pudding,12,"Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When
she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.

""Anna Maria,"" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel
Whiskers),--""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for
my dinner.""

""It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,"" said Anna
Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.

""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with
breadcrumbs.""

""Nonsense! Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria.

The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.

Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down
the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet
anybody."
the-roly-poly-pudding,13,"He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of
him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.

He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the
candle to look into the chest.

They did not see him.

Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter
to the kitchen to steal the dough.

She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.

She did not observe Moppet.

While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he
wriggled about and tried to mew for help.

But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such
very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.

Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined
the knots critically, from a safe distance."
the-roly-poly-pudding,14,"It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate
blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.

Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.

Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a
dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him
in the dough.

""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel
Whiskers.

Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she
wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the
pastry. She laid hold of his ears.

Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin
went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.

""His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.""

""I fetched as much as I could carry,"" replied Anna Maria.

""I do not think""--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom
Kitten--""I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,15,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to
be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a
little dog, scratching and yelping!

The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.

""We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our
property,--and other people's,--and depart at once.""

""I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.""

""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible,
whatever you may urge to the contrary.""

""Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a
counterpane,"" said Anna Maria. ""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in
the chimney."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,16,"So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there
was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a
very dirty dumpling!

But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of
the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round
and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.

Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and
came downstairs.

The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.

The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a
bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.

They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the
butter off.

John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to
stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for
Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.

And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the
lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the
run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like
mine."
the-roly-poly-pudding,17,"They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.

Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still
arguing in shrill tones.

She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of
luggage.

I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!

They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string
to the top of the haymow.

After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha
Twitchit's.

As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are
rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and
steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.

And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children
and grand-children and great great grand-children.

There is no end to them!

Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.

They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of
employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very
comfortably.

They hang up the rats' tails in a row or the barn door, to show how many
they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.

But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face
anything that is bigger than--

A Mouse."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,1,"Once upon a time there was a man who lived not very far from John of
Groat's house, which, as everyone knows, is in the very north of
Scotland. He lived in a little cottage by the sea-shore, and made his
living by catching seals and selling their fur, which is very valuable.

He earned a good deal of money in this way. These creatures used to
come out of the sea in large numbers, and lie on the rocks near his
house basking in the sunshine. It was not difficult to creep up
behind them and kill them.

Some of those seals were larger than others, and the country people used
to call them ""Roane."" They used to whisper that they were not seals at all, but
Mermen and Merwomen. They came from a country of their own, far down under the ocean, who assumed this strange disguise in order that they might pass through the water, and come up to breathe the air of this
earth of ours."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,2,"But the seal catcher only laughed at them, and said that those seals
were most worth killing. Their skins were so big that he got an
extra price for them.

Now it chanced one day, when he was pursuing his calling, that he
stabbed a seal with his hunting-knife. Whether the stroke had not
been sure enough or not, I cannot say, but with a loud cry of pain the
creature slipped off the rock into the sea, and disappeared under the
water, carrying the knife along with it.

The seal catcher, much annoyed at his clumsiness, and also at the loss
of his knife, went home to dinner in a very downcast frame of mind. On
his way he met a horseman, who was so tall and so strange-looking and
who rode on such a gigantic horse, that he stopped and looked at him in
astonishment. He wondered who he was, and from what country he came."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,3,"The stranger stopped also, and asked him his trade. On hearing that
he was a seal catcher, he immediately ordered a great number of seal
skins. The seal catcher was delighted, for such an order meant a large
sum of money to him. But his face fell when the horseman added that it
was absolutely necessary that the skins should be delivered that
evening.

""I cannot do it,"" he said in a disappointed voice, ""for the seals will
not come back to the rocks again until to-morrow morning.""

""I can take you to a place where there are any number of seals,""
answered the stranger, ""if you will mount behind me on my horse and come
with me."""
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,4,"The seal catcher agreed to this, and climbed up behind the rider, who
shook his bridle rein. Off the great horse galloped at such a pace
that he had much ado to keep his seat.

On and on they went, flying like the wind, until at last they came to
the edge of a huge precipice, the face of which went sheer down to the
sea. Here the mysterious horseman pulled up his steed with a jerk.

""Get off now,"" he said shortly."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,5,"The seal catcher did as he was bid. When he found himself safe on
the ground, he peeped cautiously over the edge of the cliff to see if
there were any seals lying on the rocks below.

To his astonishment he saw no rocks, only the blue sea, which came right
up to the foot of the cliff.

""Where are the seals that you spoke of?"" he asked anxiously, wishing
that he had never set out on such a rash adventure.

""You will see presently,"" answered the stranger, who was attending to
his horse's bridle."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,6,"The seal catcher was now thoroughly frightened, for he felt sure that
some evil was about to befall him. In such a lonely place he knew
that it would be useless to cry out for help.

And it seemed as if his fears would prove only too true, for the next
moment the stranger's hand was laid upon his shoulder. He felt
himself being hurled bodily over the cliff, and then he fell with a
splash into the sea.

He thought that his last hour had come, and he wondered how anyone could
work such a deed of wrong upon an innocent man."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,7,"But, to his astonishment, he found that some change must have passed
over him. Instead of being choked by the water, he could breathe
quite easily. He and his companion, who was still close at his side,
seemed to be sinking as quickly down through the sea as they had flown
through the air.

Down and down they went, nobody knows how far, till at last they came to
a huge arched door, which appeared to be made of pink coral, studded
over with cockle-shells. It opened, of its own accord, and when they
entered they found themselves in a huge hall, the walls of which were
formed of mother-of-pearl, and the floor of which was of sea-sand,
smooth, and firm, and yellow.

The hall was crowded with occupants, but they were seals, not men.
When the seal catcher turned to his companion to ask him what it all
meant, he was aghast to find that he, too, had assumed the form of a
seal. He was still more aghast when he caught sight of himself in a
large mirror that hung on the wall, and saw that he also no longer bore
the likeness of a man, but was transformed into a nice, hairy, brown
seal."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,8,"""Ah, woe to me,"" he said to himself, ""for no fault of mine own this
crafty stranger has laid some harmful charm upon me, and in this awful
guise will I remain for the rest of my natural life.""

At first none of the huge creatures spoke to him. For some reason or
other they seemed to be very sad, and moved gently about the hall,
talking quietly and mournfully to one another, or lay sadly upon the
sandy floor, wiping big tears from their eyes with their soft furry
fins.

But presently they began to notice him, and to whisper to one another.
Presently his guide moved away from him, and disappeared through a
door at the end of the hall. When he returned he held a huge knife in
his hand."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,9,"""Did you ever see this before?"" he asked, holding it out to the
unfortunate seal catcher. He, to his horror, recognised his own hunting
knife with which he had struck the seal in the morning, and which had
been carried off by the wounded animal.

At the sight of it he fell upon his face and begged for mercy. He at
once came to the conclusion that the inhabitants of the cavern, enraged
at the harm which had been wrought upon their comrade, had, in some
magic way, contrived to capture him, and to bring him down to their
subterranean abode, in order to wreak their vengeance upon him by
killing him.

But, instead of doing so, they crowded round him, rubbing their soft
noses against his fur to show their sympathy. They implored him not to
put himself about, for no harm would befall him, and they would love him
all their lives long if he would only do what they asked him."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,10,"""Tell me what it is,"" said the seal catcher, ""and I will do it, if it
lies within my power.""

""Follow me,"" answered his guide, and he led the way to the door through
which he had disappeared when he went to seek the knife.

The seal catcher followed him. And there, in a smaller room, he found a
great brown seal lying on a bed of pale pink sea-weed, with a gaping
wound in his side.

""That is my father,"" said his guide, ""who you wounded this morning,
thinking that he was one of the common seals who live in the sea,
instead of a Merman who has speech, and understanding, as you mortals
have. I brought you here to bind up his wounds, for no other hand
than yours can heal him.""

""I have no skill in the art of healing,"" said the seal catcher,
astonished at the forbearance of these strange creatures, whom he had so
unwittingly wronged; ""but I will bind up the wound to the best of my
power, and I am only sorry that it was my hands that caused it."""
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,11,"He went over to the bed, and, stooping over the wounded Merman, washed
and dressed the hurt as well as he could. The touch of his hands
appeared to work like magic, for no sooner had he finished than the
wound seemed to deaden and die, leaving only the scar. The old seal
sprang up, as well as ever.

Then there was great rejoicing throughout the whole Palace of the Seals.
They laughed, and they talked, and they embraced each other in their own
strange way, crowding round their comrade. They rubbed their noses
against his, as if to show him how delighted they were at his recovery.

But all this while the seal catcher stood alone in a corner, with his
mind filled with dark thoughts. Although he saw now that they had no
intention of killing him, he did not relish the prospect of spending the
rest of his life in the guise of a seal, fathoms deep under the ocean."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,12,"But presently, to his great joy, his guide approached him, and said,
""Now you are at liberty to return home to your wife and children. I will
take you to them, but only on one condition.""

""And what is that?"" asked the seal catcher eagerly, overjoyed at the
prospect of being restored safely to the upper world, and to his family.

""That you will take a solemn oath never to wound a seal again.""

""That will I do right gladly,"" he replied. For although the promise
meant giving up his means of livelihood, he felt that if only he
regained his proper shape he could always turn his hand to something
else."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,13,"So he took the required oath with all due solemnity, holding up his fin
as he swore, and all the other seals crowded round him as witnesses. And
a sigh of relief went through the halls when the words were spoken, for
he was the most noted seal catcher in the North.

Then he bade the strange company farewell, and, accompanied by his
guide, passed once more through the outer doors of coral, and up, and
up, and up, through the shadowy green water, until it began to grow
lighter and lighter and at last they emerged into the sunshine of earth.

Then, with one spring, they reached the top of the cliff, where the
great black horse was waiting for them, quietly nibbling the green turf."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,14,"When they left the water their strange disguise dropped from them. They were now as they had been before, a plain seal catcher and a tall,
well-dressed gentleman in riding clothes.

""Get up behind me,"" said the latter, as he swung himself into his
saddle. The seal catcher did as he was bid, taking tight hold of his
companion's coat, for he remembered how nearly he had fallen off on his
previous journey.

Then it all happened as it happened before. The bridle was shaken, and
the horse galloped off. It was not long before the seal catcher
found himself standing in safety before his own garden gate."
the-seal-catcher-and-the-merman,15,"He held out his hand to say ""good-bye,"" but as he did so the stranger
pulled out a huge bag of gold and placed it in it.

""You have done your part of the bargain--we must do ours,"" he said. ""Men
shall never say that we took away an honest man's work without making
reparation for it. Here is what will keep you in comfort to your
life's end.""

Then he vanished, and when the astonished seal catcher carried the bag
into his cottage, and turned the gold out on the table, he found that
what the stranger had said was true. He would be a rich man for
the remainder of his days."
the-snow-man,1,"'How astonishingly cold it is! My body is cracking all over!' said the Snow-man. 'The wind is really cutting one's very life out! And how that fiery thing up there glares!' He meant the sun, which was just setting. 'It sha'n't make me blink, though, and I shall keep quite cool and collected.'

Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head; his mouth consisted of an old rake, so that he had teeth as well.

He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys, and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges.

The sun went down, the full moon rose, large, round, clear and beautiful, in the dark blue sky."
the-snow-man,2,"'There it is again on the other side!' said the Snow-man, by which he meant the sun was appearing again. 'I have become quite accustomed to its glaring. I hope it will hang there and shine, so that I may be able to see myself. I wish I knew, though, how one ought to see about changing one's position. I should very much like to move about. If I only could, I would glide up and down the ice there, as I saw the boys doing; but somehow or other, I don't know how to run.'

'Bow-wow!' barked the old yard-dog; he was rather hoarse and couldn't bark very well. His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove. 'The sun will soon teach you to run! I saw that last winter with your predecessor, and farther back still with his predecessors! They have all run away!'

'I don't understand you, my friend,' said the Snow-man. 'That thing up there is to teach me to run?' He meant the moon. 'Well, it certainly did run just now, for I saw it quite plainly over there, and now here it is on this side.'

'You know nothing at all about it,' said the yard-dog. 'Why, you have only just been made. The thing you see there is the moon; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun. He will come up again tomorrow morning, and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter. The weather is going to change; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg; the weather is certainly going to change.'"
the-snow-man,3,"'I can't understand him,' said the Snow-man; 'but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant. That thing that glares so, and then disappears, the sun, as he calls it, is not my friend. I know that by instinct.'

'Bow-wow!' barked the yard-dog, and walked three times round himself, and then crept into his kennel to sleep. The weather really did change. Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood; later on came an icy wind, which sent the frost packing. But when the sun rose, it was a glorious sight. The trees and shrubs were covered with rime, and looked like a wood of coral, and every branch was thick with long white blossoms. The most delicate twigs, which are lost among the foliage in summer-time, came now into prominence, and it was like a spider's web of glistening white. The lady-birches waved in the wind; and when the sun shone, everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust, and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet.

'Isn't it wonderful?' exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden. They stopped near the Snow-man, and looked at the glistening trees. 'Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,' she said, with her eyes shining."
the-snow-man,4,"'And one can't get a fellow like this in summer either,' said the young man, pointing to the Snow-man. 'He's a beauty!'

The girl laughed, and nodded to the Snow-man, and then they both danced away over the snow.

'Who were those two?' asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog. 'You have been in this yard longer than I have. Do you know who they are?'

'Do I know them indeed?' answered the yard-dog. 'She has often stroked me, and he has given me bones. I don't bite either of them!'

'But what are they?' asked the Snow-man.

'Lovers!' replied the yard-dog. 'They will go into one kennel and gnaw the same bone!'

'Are they the same kind of beings that we are?' asked the Snow-man.

'They are our masters,' answered the yard-dog. 'Really people who have only been in the world one day know very little. That's the conclusion I have come to. Now I have age and wisdom; I know everyone in the house, and I can remember a time when I was not lying here in a cold kennel. Bow-wow!'

'The cold is splendid,' said the Snow-man. 'Tell me some more. But don't rattle your chain so, it makes me crack!'"
the-snow-man,5,"'Bow-wow!' barked the yard-dog. 'They used to say I was a pretty little fellow; then I lay in a velvet-covered chair in my master's house. My mistress used to nurse me, and kiss and fondle me, and call me her dear, sweet little Alice! But by-and-by I grew too big, and I was given to the housekeeper, and I went into the kitchen. You can see into it from where you are standing; you can look at the room in which I was master, for so I was when I was with the housekeeper. Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs, but it was more comfortable, for I wasn't chased about and teased by the children as I had been before. My food was just as good, or even better. I had my own pillow, and there was a stove there, which at this time of year is the most beautiful thing in the world. I used to creep right under that stove. Ah me! I often dream of that stove still! Bow-wow!'"
the-snow-man,6,"'Is a stove so beautiful?' asked the Snow-man. 'Is it anything like me?'

'It is just the opposite of you! It is coal-black, and has a long neck with a brass pipe. It eats firewood, so that fire spouts out of its mouth. One has to keep close beside it-quite underneath is the nicest of all. You can see it through the window from where you are standing.'

And the Snow-man looked in that direction, and saw a smooth polished object with a brass pipe. The flicker from the fire reached him across the snow. The Snow-man felt wonderfully happy, and a feeling came over him which he could not express; but all those who are not snow-men know about it."
the-snow-man,7,"'Why did you leave her?' asked the Snow-man. He had a feeling that such a being must be a lady. 'How could you leave such a place?'

'I had to!' said the yard-dog. 'They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here. I had bitten the youngest boy in the leg, because he took away the bone I was gnawing; a bone for a bone, I thought! But they were very angry, and from that time I have been chained here, and I have lost my voice. Don't you hear how hoarse I am? Bow-wow! I can't speak like other dogs. Bow-wow! That was the end of happiness!'

The Snow-man, however, was not listening to him any more; he was looking into the room where the housekeeper lived, where the stove stood on its four iron legs, and seemed to be just the same size as the Snow-man.

'How something is cracking inside me!' he said. 'Shall I never be able to get in there? It is certainly a very innocent wish, and our innocent wishes ought to be fulfilled. I must get there, and lean against the stove, if I have to break the window first!'

'You will never get inside there!' said the yard-dog; 'and if you were to reach the stove you would disappear. Bow-wow!'

'I'm as good as gone already!' answered the Snow-man. 'I believe I'm breaking up!'"
the-snow-man,8,"The whole day the Snow-man looked through the window; towards dusk the room grew still more inviting; the stove gave out a mild light, not at all like the moon or even the sun; no, as only a stove can shine, when it has something to feed upon. When the door of the room was open, it flared up-this was one of its peculiarities; it flickered quite red upon the Snow-man's white face.

'I can't stand it any longer!' he said. 'How beautiful it looks with its tongue stretched out like that!'

It was a long night, but the Snow-man did not find it so; there he stood, wrapt in his pleasant thoughts, and they froze, so that he cracked.

Next morning the panes of the kitchen window were covered with ice, and the most beautiful ice-flowers that even a snow-man could desire, only they blotted out the stove. The window would not open; he couldn't see the stove which he thought was such a lovely lady. There was a cracking and cracking inside him and all around; there was just such a frost as a snow-man would delight in. But this Snow-man was different: how could he feel happy?"
the-snow-man,9,"'Yours is a bad illness for a Snow-man!' said the yard-dog. 'I also suffered from it, but I have got over it. Bow-wow!' he barked. 'The weather is going to change!' he added.

The weather did change. There came a thaw.

When this set in the Snow-man set off. He did not say anything, and he did not complain, and those are bad signs.

One morning he broke up altogether. And lo! where he had stood there remained a broomstick standing upright, round which the boys had built him!

'Ah! now I understand why he loved the stove,' said the yard-dog. 'That is the raker they use to clean out the stove! The Snow-man had a stove-raker in his body! That's what was the matter with him! And now it's all over with him! Bow-wow!'

And before long it was all over with the winter too! 'Bow-wow!' barked the hoarse yard-dog.

But the young girl sang:

     Woods, your bright green garments don!
     Willows, your woolly gloves put on!
     Lark and cuckoo, daily sing-     February has brought the spring!
     My heart joins in your song so sweet;
     Come out, dear sun, the world to greet!
And no one thought of the Snow-man."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,1,"There were once upon a time five-and twenty tin-soldiers-all brothers, as they were made out of the same old tin spoon. Their uniform was red and blue, and they shouldered their guns and looked straight in front of them. The first words that they heard in this world, when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off, were: 'Hurrah, tin-soldiers!' This was exclaimed by a little boy, clapping his hands; they had been given to him because it was his birthday, and now he began setting them out on the table. Each soldier was exactly like the other in shape, except just one, who had been made last when the tin had run short; but there he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others did on two, and he is the one that became famous."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,2,"There were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out, but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard, with windows through which you could see into the rooms. In front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake. Wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it. That was all very pretty; but the most beautiful thing was a little lady, who stood in the open doorway. She was cut out of paper, but she had on a dress of the finest muslin, with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders, fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper, which was as large as her head. The little lady was stretching out both her arms, for she was a Dancer, and was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the Tin-soldier couldn't find it anywhere, and thought that she, too, had only one leg."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,3,"'That's the wife for me!' he thought; 'but she is so grand, and lives in a castle, whilst I have only a box with four-and-twenty others. This is no place for her! But I must make her acquaintance.' Then he stretched himself out behind a snuff-box that lay on the table; from thence he could watch the dainty little lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.

When the night came all the other tin-soldiers went into their box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the toys began to play at visiting, dancing, and fighting. The tin-soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to be out too, but they could not raise the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the slate-pencil ran about the slate; there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them, in poetry too! The only two who did not stir from their places were the Tin-soldier and the little Dancer. She remained on tip-toe, with both arms outstretched; he stood steadfastly on his one leg, never moving his eyes from her face."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,4,"The clock struck twelve, and crack! off flew the lid of the snuff-box; but there was no snuff inside, only a little black imp-that was the beauty of it.

'Hullo, Tin-soldier!' said the imp. 'Don't look at things that aren't intended for the likes of you!'

But the Tin-soldier took no notice, and seemed not to hear.

'Very well, wait till to-morrow!' said the imp."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,5,"When it was morning, and the children had got up, the Tin-soldier was put in the window; and whether it was the wind or the little black imp, I don't know, but all at once the window flew open and out fell the little Tin-soldier, head over heels, from the third-storey window! That was a terrible fall, I can tell you! He landed on his head with his leg in the air, his gun being wedged between two paving-stones.

The nursery-maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him, but, though they were so near him that they almost trod on him, they did not notice him. If the Tin-soldier had only called out 'Here I am!' they must have found him; but he did not think it fitting for him to cry out, because he had on his uniform."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,6,"Soon it began to drizzle; then the drops came faster, and there was a regular down-pour. When it was over, two little street boys came along.

'Just look!' cried one. 'Here is a Tin-soldier! He shall sail up and down in a boat!'

So they made a little boat out of newspaper, put the Tin-soldier in it, and made him sail up and down the gutter; both the boys ran along beside him, clapping their hands. What great waves there were in the gutter, and what a swift current! The paper-boat tossed up and down, and in the middle of the stream it went so quick that the Tin-soldier trembled; but he remained steadfast, showed no emotion, looked straight in front of him, shouldering his gun. All at once the boat passed under a long tunnel that was as dark as his box had been."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,7,"'Where can I be coming now?' he wondered. 'Oh, dear! This is the black imp's fault! Ah, if only the little lady were sitting beside me in the boat, it might be twice as dark for all I should care!'

Suddenly there came along a great water-rat that lived in the tunnel.

'Have you a passport?' asked the rat. 'Out with your passport!'

But the Tin-soldier was silent, and grasped his gun more firmly."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,8,"The boat sped on, and the rat behind it. Ugh! how he showed his teeth, as he cried to the chips of wood and straw: 'Hold him, hold him! he has not paid the toll! He has not shown his passport!'

But the current became swifter and stronger. The Tin-soldier could already see daylight where the tunnel ended; but in his ears there sounded a roaring enough to frighten any brave man. Only think! at the end of the tunnel the gutter discharged itself into a great canal; that would be just as dangerous for him as it would be for us to go down a waterfall."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,9,"Now he was so near to it that he could not hold on any longer. On went the boat, the poor Tin-soldier keeping himself as stiff as he could: no one should say of him afterwards that he had flinched. The boat whirled three, four times round, and became filled to the brim with water: it began to sink! The Tin-soldier was standing up to his neck in water, and deeper and deeper sank the boat, and softer and softer grew the paper; now the water was over his head. He was thinking of the pretty little Dancer, whose face he should never see again, and there sounded in his ears, over and over again:

          'Forward, forward, soldier bold!
           Death's before thee, grim and cold!'"
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,10,"The paper came in two, and the soldier fell-but at that moment he was swallowed by a great fish.

Oh! how dark it was inside, even darker than in the tunnel, and it was really very close quarters! But there the steadfast little Tin-soldier lay full length, shouldering his gun."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,11,"Up and down swam the fish, then he made the most dreadful contortions, and became suddenly quite still. Then it was as if a flash of lightning had passed through him; the daylight streamed in, and a voice exclaimed, 'Why, here is the little Tin-soldier!' The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold, and brought into the kitchen, where the cook had cut it open with a great knife. She took up the soldier between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room, where everyone wanted to see the hero who had been found inside a fish; but the Tin-soldier was not at all proud. They put him on the table, and-no, but what strange things do happen in this world!-the Tin-soldier was in the same room in which he had been before! He saw the same children, and the same toys on the table; and there was the same grand castle with the pretty little Dancer. She was still standing on one leg with the other high in the air; she too was steadfast. That touched the Tin-soldier, he was nearly going to shed tin-tears; but that would not have been fitting for a soldier. He looked at her, but she said nothing.

All at once one of the little boys took up the Tin-soldier, and threw him into the stove, giving no reasons; but doubtless the little black imp in the snuff-box was at the bottom of this too."
the-steadfast-tin-soldier,12,"There the Tin-soldier lay, and felt a heat that was truly terrible; but whether he was suffering from actual fire, or from the ardour of his passion, he did not know. All his colour had disappeared; whether this had happened on his travels or whether it was the result of trouble, who can say? He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; but he remained steadfast, with his gun at his shoulder. Suddenly a door opened, the draught caught up the little Dancer, and off she flew like a sylph to the Tin-soldier in the stove, burst into flames-and that was the end of her! Then the Tin-soldier melted down into a little lump, and when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes, she found him in the shape of a heart. There was nothing left of the little Dancer but her gilt rose, burnt as black as a cinder."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,1,"THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!

THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of
Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.

THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits
her own head.

SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard!

THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.

MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,2,"THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the
bell-pull.

MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.

MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a
hole in the duster. The Mouse comes VERY close.

AND then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!

AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she
will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.

SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball.

BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied
it--there was no Mouse!

HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of
the cupboard!"
the-straw-the-coal-and-the-bean,1,"THERE lived in a certain village a poor old woman who had collected a
mess of beans, and was going to cook them. So she made a fire on her
hearth. In order to make it burn better, she put in a handful of
straw. When the beans began to bubble in the pot, one of them fell out
and lay, never noticed, near a straw which was already there. Soon a
red-hot coal jumped out of the fire and joined the pair. The straw began
first, and said,

""Dear friends, how do you come here?"" The coal answered,

""I jumped out of the fire by great good luck, or I should certainly have
met with my death. I should have been burned to ashes."" The bean said,

""I too have come out of it with a whole skin. If the old woman had
kept me in the pot I should have been cooked into a soft mass like my
comrades.""

""Nor should I have met with a better fate,"" said the straw. ""The old
woman has turned my brothers into fire and smoke, sixty of them she took
up at once and deprived of life. Very luckily I managed to slip through
her fingers.""

""What had we better do now?"" said the coal.

""I think,"" answered the bean, ""that as we have been so lucky as to
escape with our lives, we will join in good fellowship together.
Lest any more bad fortune should happen to us here, we will go abroad
into foreign lands."""
the-straw-the-coal-and-the-bean,2,"The proposal pleased the two others, and forthwith they started on their
travels. Soon they came to a little brook, and as there was no
stepping-stone, and no bridge, they could not tell how they were to get
to the other side. The straw was struck with a good idea, and said,

""I will lay myself across, so that you can go over me as if I were a
bridge!""

So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an ardent nature, quickly trotted up to go over the new-made
bridge. When, however, she reached the middle, and heard the water
rushing past beneath her, she was struck with terror, and stopped, and
could get no farther. So the straw began to get burnt, broke in two
pieces, and fell in the brook. The coal slipped down, hissing as she
touched the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, who had prudently
remained behind on the bank, could not help laughing at the sight.
Not being able to contain herself, she went on laughing so excessively that
she burst. And now would she certainly have been undone for ever, if a
tailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by
the brook. As he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and
thread and stitched her together again. The bean thanked him in the most
elegant manner, but as he had sewn her up with black stitches, all beans
since then have a black seam."
the-sunchild,1,"Once there was a woman who had no children, and this made her very
unhappy. So she spoke one day to the Sunball, saying: 'Dear Sunball,
send me only a little girl now, and when she is twelve years old you may
take her back again.'

So soon after this the Sunball sent her a little girl, whom the woman
called Letiko, and watched over with great care till she was twelve
years old. Soon after that, while Letiko was away one day gathering
herbs, the Sunball came to her, and said: 'Letiko, when you go home,
tell your mother that she must bethink herself of what she promised me.'"
the-sunchild,2,"Then Letiko went straight home, and said to her mother: 'While I was
gathering herbs a fine tall gentleman came to me and charged me to tell
you that you should remember what you promised him.'

When the woman heard that she was sore afraid, and immediately shut all
the doors and windows of the house, stopped up all the chinks and holes,
and kept Letiko hidden away, that the Sunball should not come and take
her away. But she forgot to close up the keyhole, and through it the
Sunball sent a ray into the house, which took hold of the little girl
and carried her away to him."
the-sunchild,3,"One day, the Sunball having sent her to the straw shed to fetch straw,
the girl sat down on the piles of straw and bemoaned herself, saying:
'As sighs this straw under my feet so sighs my heart after my mother.'

And this caused her to be so long away that the Sunball asked her, when
she came back: 'Eh, Letiko, where have you been so long?'

She answered: 'My slippers are too big, and I could not go faster.'

Then the Sunball made the slippers shorter."
the-sunchild,4,"Another time he sent her to fetch water, and when she came to the
spring, she sat down and lamented, saying: 'As flows the water even so
flows my heart with longing for my mother.'

Thus she again remained so long away that the Sunball asked her: 'Eh,
Letiko, why have you remained so long away?'

And she answered: 'My petticoat is too long and hinders me in walking.'

Then the Sunball cut her petticoat to make it shorter."
the-sunchild,5,"Another time the Sunball sent her to bring him a pair of sandals, and
as the girl carried these in her hand she began to lament, saying: 'As
creaks the leather so creaks my heart after my little mother.'

When she came home the Sunball asked her again: 'Eh, Letiko, why do you
come home so late?'

'My red hood is too wide, and falls over my eyes, therefore I could not
go fast.'

Then he made the hood narrower."
the-sunchild,6,"At last, however, the Sunball became aware how sad Letiko was. He sent
her a second time to bring straw, and, slipping in after her, he heard
how she lamented for her mother. Then he went home, called two foxes to
him, and said: 'Will you take Letiko home?'

'Yes, why not?'

'But what will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty
by the way?'

'We will eat her flesh and drink her blood.'

When the Sunball heard that, he said: 'You are not suited for this
affair.'

Then he sent them away, and called two hares to him, and said: 'Will you
take Letiko home to her mother?'

'Yes, why not?'

'What will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by
the way?'

'We will eat grass and drink from streamlets.'

'Then take her, and bring her home.'"
the-sunchild,7,"Then the hares set out, taking Letiko with them, and because it was a
long way to her home they became hungry by the way. Then they said to
the little girl: 'Climb this tree, dear Letiko, and remain there till we
have finished eating.'

So Letiko climbed the tree, and the hares went grazing.

It was not very long, however, before a lamia came under the tree and
called out: 'Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what beautiful shoes I
have on.'

'Oh! my shoes are much finer than yours.'

'Come down. I am in a hurry, for my house is not yet swept.'

'Go home and sweep it then, and come back when you are ready.'"
the-sunchild,8,"Then the lamia went away and swept her house, and when she was ready
she came back and called out: 'Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what a
beautiful apron I have.'

'Oh! my apron is much finer than yours.'

'If you will not come down I will cut down the tree and eat you.'

'Do so, and then eat me.'

Then the lamia hewed with all her strength at the tree, but could not
cut it down. And when she saw that, she called out: 'Letiko, Letiko,
come down, for I must feed my children.'

'Go home then and feed them, and come back when you are ready.'"
the-sunchild,9,"When the lamia was gone away, Letiko called out: 'Little hares! little
hares!'

Then said one hare to the other: 'Listen, Letiko is calling;' and they
both ran back to her as fast as they could go. Then Letiko came down
from the tree, and they went on their way.

The lamia ran as fast as she could after them, to catch them up, and
when she came to a field where people were working she asked them: 'Have
you seen anyone pass this way?'

They answered: 'We are planting beans.'

'Oh! I did not ask about that; but if anyone had passed this way.'

But the people only answered the louder: 'Are you deaf? It is beans,
beans, beans we are planting.'"
the-sunchild,10,"When Letiko had nearly reached her home the dog knew her, and called
out, 'Bow wow! see here comes Letiko!'

And the mother said, 'Hush! thou beast of ill-omen! wilt thou make me
burst with misery?'

Next the cat on the roof saw her, and called out 'Miaouw! miaouw! see
here comes Letiko!'

And the mother said, 'Keep silence! thou beast of ill-omen! wilt thou
make me burst with misery?'

Then the cock spied, and called out: 'Cock-a-doodle-do! see here comes
Letiko!'

And the mother said again: 'Be quiet! thou bird of ill-omen! wilt thou
make me burst with misery?'"
the-sunchild,11,"The nearer Letiko and the two hares came to the house the nearer also
came the lamia, and when the hare was about to slip in by the house door
she caught it by its little tail and tore it out.

When the hare came in the mother stood up and said to it: 'Welcome, dear
little hare; because you have brought me back Letiko I will silver your
little tail.'

And she did so; and lived ever after with her daughter in happiness and
content."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,1,"ONCE upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house; it was red
brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front
door and a chimney.

IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged
to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.

Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had
been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.

THERE were two red lobsters, and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some
pears and oranges.

They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,2,"ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's
perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet.
Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner
near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.

Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.

Tom Thumb was a mouse.

A MINUTE afterwards Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and
when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on
the oilcloth under the coal-box.

THE doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace. Tom Thumb and
Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug. They pushed the front
door--it was not fast."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,3,"TOM THUMB and Hunca Munca went up-stairs and peeped into the
dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!

Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons,
and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!

TOM THUMB set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny
yellow, streaked with red.

The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.

""It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.""

HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another
lead knife.

""It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,"" said Hunca Munca.

THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.

""Let it alone,"" said Tom Thumb; ""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,4,"HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the
dish.

Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the
floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash,
smash!

The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made
of nothing but plaster!

THEN there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and
Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears, and the
oranges."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,5,"As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot
crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.

TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top--there
was no soot.

WHILE Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another
disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled
""Rice,"" ""Coffee"" ""Sago""; but when she turned them upside down there was
nothing inside except red and blue beads.

THEN those mice set to work to do all the mischief they
could--especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of
drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top-floor window.

But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out
of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a
feather-bed."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,6,"WITH Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and
across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the
mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.

THEN Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a bird-cage,
and several small odds and ends. The bookcase and the bird-cage refused
to go into the mouse-hole.

HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.

HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there
was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to
their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,7,"WHAT a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!

Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane leaned
against the kitchen dresser and smiled; but neither of them made any
remark.

THE bookcase and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box; but
Hunca Munca has got the cradle and some of Lucinda's clothes.

SHE also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.

THE little girl that the doll's house belonged to said: ""I will get a
doll dressed like a policeman!""

BUT the nurse said: ""I will set a mouse-trap!"""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,8,"SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice. But they were not so very,
very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.

He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve
he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and
Jane.

AND very early every morning--before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca
comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!"
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,1,"ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.

He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.

A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and
beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.

AS soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the
road, and set off--with a hop, skip and a jump--to call upon his
relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.

THAT wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest sandiest hole of
all, cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,2,"Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting
rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what
WE call lavender).

LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.

He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top
of his Cousin Peter.

PETER was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red
cotton pocket-handkerchief."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,3,"""Peter,""--said little Benjamin, in a whisper--""who has got your
clothes?""

PETER replied--""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"" and described
how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and
coat.

Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin, and assured him that Mr.
McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly
for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.

PETER said he hoped that it would rain."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,4,"At this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole
calling--""Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!""

Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.

THEY went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at
the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's
garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the
scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.

LITTLE Benjamin said, ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a
gate; the proper way to get in, is to climb down a pear tree.""

Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed
below was newly raked and quite soft.

IT had been sown with lettuces."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,5,"They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed,
especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.

LITTLE Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back
Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket
handkerchief.

They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;
there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.

Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him.

THEN he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with
onions, as a little present for his Aunt.

Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,6,"BENJAMIN, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce
leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his
father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.

(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)

The lettuces certainly were very fine.

PETER did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently
he dropped half the onions.

LITTLE Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the
pear-tree, with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the
other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under
a sunny red-brick wall.

The mice sat on their door-steps cracking cherry-stones, they winked at
Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.

PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,7,"THEY got amongst flower-pots, and frames and tubs; Peter heard noises
worse than ever, his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!

He was a step or two in front of his cousin, when he suddenly stopped.

THIS is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!

Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no
time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large
basket....

THE cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the
basket.

Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!

Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.

SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,8,"I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,
because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful;
it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.

The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the
afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.

AT length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of
mortar fell from the wall above.

The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top
of the wall of the upper terrace.

He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his
hand.

He was looking for his son.v"
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,9,"OLD Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.

He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the
cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house,
scratching off a handful of fur.

The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.

WHEN old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked
the door.

Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the
ears, and whipped him with the little switch.

Then he took out his nephew Peter.

THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the
garden."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,10,"When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several
things which perplexed him.

It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in
a pair of clogs--only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little!

Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut
herself up INSIDE the green-house, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.

WHEN Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to
see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded
up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and
hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,1,"WHAT a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!
--Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the
farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.

HER sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to
leave the hatching to some one else--""I have not the patience to sit on
a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would
let them go cold; you know you would!""

""I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,"" quacked
Jemima Puddle-duck.

SHE tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,2,"Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest
right away from the farm.

SHE set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads
over the hill.

She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.

WHEN she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.

She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,3,"JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill
a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.

SHE flew beautifully when she had got a good start.

She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the
middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.

JEMIMA alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a
convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst
some tall fox-gloves.

But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly
dressed gentleman reading a newspaper."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,4,"He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.

""Quack?"" said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one
side--""Quack?""

THE gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously
at Jemima--

""Madam, have you lost your way?"" said he. He had a long bushy tail which
he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.

Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had
not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry
nesting-place.

""AH! is that so? indeed!"" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers,
looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in
his coat-tail pocket.

Jemima complained of the superfluous hen."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,5,"""Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would
teach it to mind its own business!""

""BUT as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers
in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may
sit there as long as you like,"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.

He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the
fox-gloves.

It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one
on top of another, by way of a chimney.

""THIS is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter
house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman.

There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old
soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in.

THE shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating;
but it was comfortable and very soft.

Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of
feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any
trouble at all."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,6,"WHEN she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log
reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking
over the top of it.

He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for
the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came
back again next day.

He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine
nestful in his wood-shed.

JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them
immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not
there.

At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--""and
I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest
until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,"" said the
conscientious Jemima.

""MADAM, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide
oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you
a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!""

""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a
savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some
parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,"" said
the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,7,"JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and
onions made her suspicious.

She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the
different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.

AND she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.

The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, ""What are you doing with those
onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima
Puddle-duck?""

Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.

The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she
described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.

HE asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position
of the house and shed.

Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two
fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,8,"JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny
afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions
in a bag.

She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy
long-tailed gentleman.

HE was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily
round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.

""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me
the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!""

He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like
that.

She felt surprised, and uncomfortable.

WHILE she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the
shed. Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and
then locked it.

Jemima became much alarmed."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,9,"A MOMENT afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying,
growls and howls, squealing and groans.

And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.

PRESENTLY Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima
Puddle-duck.

Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before
he could stop them.

He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.

JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.

SHE laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself:
but only four of them hatched.

Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had
always been a bad sitter."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,1,"MR. JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his
rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he
kept his boat.

THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It
was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.

MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. ""I
know a good place for minnows,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.

Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He
had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass,
his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little
wriggling worm at the end."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,2,"THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the
float.

""This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,"" said Mr.
Jeremy Fisher.

HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out
of his basket.

""I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,""
said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked
the toe of one of his goloshes.

Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating
his sandwich."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,3,"ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst
the rushes at the side of the pond.

""I trust that is not a rat,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; ""I think I had
better get away from here.""

MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the
bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous
bobbit!

""A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!"" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher,
jerking up his rod.

BUT what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy
landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!

THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until
he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.

AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at
Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,4,"AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking
his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing
happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had
not been wearing a macintosh!

A GREAT big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--and
it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow! Ow! Ow!""--and then it turned and
dived down to the bottom of the pond!

BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in
less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it
swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.

MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the
bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to
the edge of the pond.

HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across
the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,5,"""WHAT a mercy that was not a pike!"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ""I have lost
my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should
never have dared to go fishing again!""

HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came
to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in
his larder.

SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat,

AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string
bag.

AND instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper
with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_
think it must have been nasty!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,1,"ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a
farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always
losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!

One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
""I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen
them, Tabby Kitten?""

THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled
hen--

""Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?""

But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--

""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!""

AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,2,"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he
flew over a stile and away.

Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind
Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had
no top!

And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things
spread upon the grass.

LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her;
she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right
away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!

PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,3,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the
water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an
egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks
of a VERY small person.

Lucie ran on, and on.

THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and
there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited
rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!

But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside
it some one was singing--

    ""Lily-white and clean, oh!
    With little frills between, oh!
    Smooth and hot--red rusty spot
    Never here be seen, oh!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,4,"LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. A little
frightened voice called out ""Who's that?""

Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the
hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just
like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's
head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was
everything there.

THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her
hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.

Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her
striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle,
and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie
had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,5,"""WHO are you?"" said Lucie. ""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?""

The little person made a bob-curtsey--""Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name
is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent
clear-starcher!"" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and
spread it on the ironing-blanket.

""WHAT'S that thing?"" said Lucie--""that's not my pocket-handkin?""

""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to
Cock Robin!""

And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,6,"THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse--""That isn't my pinny?""
said Lucie.

""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny
Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!""
said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes
went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.

""THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!"" cried Lucie--""and there's my
pinny!""

Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,7,"""Oh that IS lovely!"" said Lucie.

""AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?""

""Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how
she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon
go barefoot!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

""WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?""

""Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID
so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the
smell.""

""There's another one of mine,"" said Lucie.

""WHAT are those funny little white things?""

""That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron
them; she washes them herself.""

""There's my last pocket-handkin!"" said Lucie.

""AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?""

""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most
terrible particular!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ""Now I've finished my
ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.""

""WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?"" said Lucie.

""Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.""

""Will their jackets take off?"" asked Lucy.

""Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And
here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.
They're ALWAYS marked at washing!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,8,"AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of
mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat
with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue
jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had
gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!

THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and
very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her
cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't
like to sit too near her.AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of

the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,9,"WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and
Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and
fastened with a silver safety-pin.

And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the
door, and hid the key under the door-sill.

THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the
bundles of clothes!

All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet
them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!

AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals
and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,10,"SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was
nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.

LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she
turned to say ""Good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman--But what a
VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or
for the washing bill!

She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white
frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?

AND how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with PRICKLES!

Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,11,"(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the
stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and
a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?

And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill called
Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs.
Tiggy-wivnkle!)"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,1,"ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were--
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.

They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a
very big fir tree.

""NOW, my dears,"" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ""you may go into the
fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your
Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.""

""NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out."""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,2,"THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker's. She
bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.

FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down
the lane to gather blackberries;

BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's
garden and squeezed under the gate!

FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some
radishes;

AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,3,"BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.
McGregor!

MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but
he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""Stop
thief!""

PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for
he had forgotten the way back to the gate.

He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst
the potatoes."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,4,"AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think
he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a
gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It
was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.

PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were
overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great
excitement, and implored him to exert himself.

MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top
of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind
him."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,5,"AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been
a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.

MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed,
perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over
carefully, looking under each.

Presently Peter sneezed--""Kertyschoo!"" Mr. McGregor was after him in no
time,

AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,
upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and
he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,6,"PETER sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright,
and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp
with sitting in that can.

After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very
fast, and looking all around.

HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for
a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.

An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying
peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the
gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not
answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,7,"THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became
more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor
filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she
sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as
if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to
her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.

HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he
heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter

scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he
came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first
thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards
Peter, and beyond him was the gate!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,8,"PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as
fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant
bushes.

Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside
the garden.

MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to
frighten the blackbirds.

PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the
big fir-tree.

He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the
floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy
cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the
second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a
fortnight!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,9,"I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.

His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a
dose of it to Peter!

""One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.""

BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries,
for supper."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,1,"IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is ""soporific.""

I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a
rabbit.

They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!

WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a
large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.

I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were
generally called the ""Flopsy Bunnies.""

AS there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow
cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.

SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,2,"WHEN this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a
rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.

MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper
bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which
always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot
or two. One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces,
which had ""shot"" into flower.

THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after
another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown
grass.

Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep
he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep
off the flies."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,3,"THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the
lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing
machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse
picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.

(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a
woodmouse with a long tail.)

SHE rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.

The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.

WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a
heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a
sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy
Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a
jam pot."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,4,"THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of
grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.

They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.

Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny
little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He
stared at them for some time.

PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.

Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--

""One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!"" said he as he dropped
them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was
turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but
still they did not wake up."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,5,"MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.

He went to put away the mowing machine.

WHILE he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came
across the field.

She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?

THEN the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag
off his head, and they told the doleful tale.

Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.

But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the
bottom corner of the sack."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,6,"THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.

Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable
marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.

THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.

MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.

He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.

The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.

THEY watched him go into his house.

And then they crept up to the window to listen."
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,7,"MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would
have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened
to have been inside it.

They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--

""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!"" said Mr. McGregor.

""EH? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?"" enquired Mrs.
McGregor.

""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!"" repeated Mr.
McGregor, counting on his fingers--""one, two, three--""

""Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?""

""In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!"" replied Mr. McGregor.

(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)"
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,8,"MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel
six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all
different shapes.

""Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.""

""Line your old cloak?"" shouted Mr. McGregor--""I shall sell them and buy
myself baccy!""

""Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.""

MRS. McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.

When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that
Mr. McGregor had ""done it a purpose."""
the-tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies,9,"AND Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came
flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.

It was rather hurt.

THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.

SO Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get
her rabbit skins.

But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough
rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and
a pair of warm mittens."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,1,"ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel,
called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a
tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.

TIMMY TIPTOES sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and
chuckled--""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store
for winter and spring."" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the
thatch--""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.""
""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in
spring-time,"" replied prudent Timothy."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,2,"WHEN Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other
squirrels were there already.

Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away
quietly by themselves.

EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They
carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near
the tree where they had built their nest.

WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole
high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled
down--down--down inside.

""How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!"" said
Goody.

""I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,"" said Timmy
Tiptoes, peeping into the hole."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,3,"THEY did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! Squirrels
who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they
cannot remember the place.

The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began
to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some
nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other
squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!

UNFORTUNATELY, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from
bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were
several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,4,"The first one sang--""Who's bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's-been-digging-up
MY nuts?""

And another sang--""Little bita bread and-NO-cheese! Little bit-a-bread
and-NO-cheese!""

THE squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the
bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and
it sang--""Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?""

Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little
bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and
it meant nothing at all."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,5,"BUT when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy
Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The
innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a
fright!

Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his
nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--""Who's-been digging-up
MY-nuts?""

THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was
the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too
small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a
wonder they did not break his ribs. ""We will leave him here till he
confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--

""Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts?""

TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon
half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and
still."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,6,"GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of
tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.

Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she
ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind
squirrels drove her away.

She wandered all over the wood, calling--

""Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"""
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,7,"IN the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself
tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it
seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs
hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk
appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?

It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the
house was full of provisions.

THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the
tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!"" It laughed and chuckled when it
heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it enticed him to
eat quantities--""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I
thin myself? My wife will be anxious!"" ""Just another nut--or two nuts;
let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter
and fatter!"
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,8,"NOW Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any
more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how
they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they
rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful,
there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful,
a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.

""IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full,
and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee,
has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of
nuts?""

""I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not not know that anybody lived
here,"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; ""but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband,
Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."" ""I know where Chippy is; a little bird
told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,9,"SHE led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.

Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice
and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--

    ""My little old man and I fell out,
    How shall we bring this matter about?
    Bring it about as well as you can,
    And get you gone, you little old man!""

""You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,"" said Goody
Tiptoes. ""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy
Hackee, bites!"""
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,10,"Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the
fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--

    ""For the diddlum day
    Day diddle dum di!
    Day diddle diddle dum day!""

THEN Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--""Timmy Tiptoes! Oh
fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"" And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?
Why, certainly!""

He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he
could not get out."
the-tale-of-timmy-tiptoes,11,"Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed
down below and chuckled.

AND so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of
the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.

Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.

BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it
was uncomfortable.

AT last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was
looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.

CHIPPY HACKEE went home in a hurry!

AND when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his
head; and he was more uncomfortable still.

And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a
little padlock.

AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he
sings--""Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?""
But nobody ever answers!"
the-teapot,1,"THERE was once a proud teapot; it was proud of being porcelain, proud of its long spout, proud of its broad handle. It had something before and behind,--the spout before and the handle behind,--and that was what it talked about. But it did not talk of its lid, which was cracked and riveted; these were defects, and one does not talk of one's defects, for there are plenty of others to do that. The cups, the cream pot, and the sugar bowl, the whole tea service, would think much oftener of the lid's imperfections--and talk about them--than of the sound handle and the remarkable spout. The teapot knew it."
the-teapot,2,"""I know you,"" it said within itself. ""I know, too, my imperfection, and I am well aware that in that very thing is seen my humility, my modesty. Imperfections we all have, but we also have compensations. The cups have a handle, the sugar bowl a lid; I have both, and one thing besides, in front, which they can never have. I have a spout, and that makes me the queen of the tea table. I spread abroad a blessing on thirsting mankind, for in me the Chinese leaves are brewed in the boiling, tasteless water."""
the-teapot,3,"All this said the teapot in its fresh young life. It stood on the table that was spread for tea; it was lifted by a very delicate hand, but the delicate hand was awkward. The teapot fell, the spout snapped off, and the handle snapped off. The lid was no worse to speak of; the worst had been spoken of that.
The teapot lay in a swoon on the floor, while the boiling water ran out of it. It was a horrid shame, but the worst was that everybody jeered at it; they jeered at the teapot and not at the awkward hand.
""I never shall forget that experience,"" said the teapot, when it afterward talked of its life. ""I was called an invalid, and placed in a corner, and the next day was given to a woman who begged for victuals. I fell into poverty, and stood dumb both outside and in. But then, just as I was, began my better life. One can be one thing and still become quite another."
the-teapot,4,"""Earth was placed in me. For a teapot, this is the same as being buried, but in the earth was placed a flower bulb. Who placed it there, who gave it, I know not; but given it was, and it became a compensation for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water, a compensation for the broken handle and spout.
""And the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay in me; it became my heart, my living heart, such as I had never before possessed. There was life in me, power and might. The heart pulsed, and the bulb put forth sprouts; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower."
the-teapot,5,"""I saw it, I bore it, I forgot myself in its delight. Blessed is it to forget oneself in another. The flower gave me no thanks; it did not think of me. It was admired and praised, and I was glad at that. How happy it must have been! One day I heard some one say that the flower deserved a better pot. I was thumped hard on my back, which was a great affliction, and the flower was put into a better pot. I was thrown out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd. But I have the memory, and that I can never lose."""
the-toad,1,"The well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one. It
was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a
bucketful of water over the edge of the well. Though the water was
clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror
itself in the waters. But as far as its beams could reach, green
things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well."
the-toad,2,"Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race. They had, in fact,
come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old
Mother-Toad, who was still alive. The green Frogs, who had been
established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called
them ""well-guests."" But the new-comers seemed determined to stay where
they were, for they found it very agreeable living ""in a dry place,""
as they called the wet stones."
the-toad,3,"The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller. She happened to be in
the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong
for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. Fortunately she scrambled out
of the bucket. But she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and
had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back. She certainly
had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and
all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world. The
Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, but
she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left
off asking."
the-toad,4,"""She's thick, and fat and ugly,"" said the young green Frogs.
""and her children will be just as ugly as she is.""

""That may be,"" retorted the mother-Toad, ""but one of them has a
jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.""

The young frogs listened and stared. As these words did not
please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water. But
the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each
of them thought that he must have the jewel. Then they sat and
held their heads quite still. But at length they asked what it was
that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be."
the-toad,5,"""Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot
describe it,"" said the Mother-Toad. ""It's something which one
carries about for one's own pleasure, and that makes other people
angry. But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you.""

""Well, I haven't got the jewel,"" said the smallest of the Toads;
she was as ugly as a toad can be. ""Why should I have such a precious
thing? And if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure.
No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out. It must be beautiful up there.""

""You'd better stay where you are,"" said the old Mother-Toad,
""for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have. Take
care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death. Even if you
get into it safely, you may fall out. And it's not every one who falls
so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones.""

""Quack!"" said the little Toad. That's just as if one of us
were to say, ""Aha!"""
the-toad,6,"She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to
look over. She felt such a longing for the green, up there. The
next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up,
filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone
on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it.
Our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was
drawn to the top, and emptied out."
the-toad,7,"""Ugh, you beast!"" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket,
when he saw the toad. ""You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one
while."" And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which
just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles
which grew high by the well's brink. Here she saw stem by stem, but
she looked up also. The sun shone through the leaves, which were quite
transparent. She felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly
into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and
leaves."
the-toad,8,"""It's much nicer here than down in the well! I should like to stay
here my whole life long!"" said the little Toad. So she lay there for
an hour, yes, for two hours. ""I wonder what is to be found up here? As
I have come so far, I must try to go still farther."" And so she
crawled on as fast as she could crawl. She got out upon the highway,
where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as
she marched across the way.

""I've got to a dry place now, and no mistake,"" said the Toad.
""It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so."""
the-toad,9,"She came to the ditch. Forget-me-nots were growing there,
and meadow-sweet. A very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn,
and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers. Gay
colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by.
The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it
might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural
thing to do.

""If one could only make such a journey as that!"" said the Toad.
""Croak! how capital that would be."""
the-toad,10,"Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and
experienced no want of provisions. On the ninth day she thought,
""Forward! onward!"" But what could she find more charming and
beautiful? Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs. During the last
night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were
cousins in the neighborhood.

""It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well,
and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty
road. But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad.
We can't do without that. Nature alone is not enough for one."" And
so she went forward on her journey.

She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about
which grew reeds. She walked into it.

""It will be too damp for you here,"" said the Frogs; ""but you are
very welcome! Are you a he or a she? But it doesn't matter; you are
equally welcome."""
the-toad,11,"And she was invited to the concert in the evening--the family
concert. Great enthusiasm and thin voices; we know the sort of
thing. No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, for
the whole pond was free.

""Now I shall resume my journey,"" said the little Toad. She
always felt a longing for something better.

She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the
moon gleaming. Then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher and
higher.

""Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well. I
must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."" And
when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, ""I
wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into which
I must step to get higher up? Or is the sun the great bucket? How
great it is! how bright it is! It can take up all. I must look out,
that I may not miss the opportunity. Oh, how it seems to shine in my
head! I don't think the jewel can shine brighter. But I haven't the
jewel; not that I cry about that--no, I must go higher up, into
splendor and joy! I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid. It's a
difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken. Onward, therefore,
straight onward!"""
the-toad,12,"She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon
found herself on a road beside which people dwelt. There were
flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens. And she sat down to rest by
a kitchen garden.

""What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew!
and how beautiful and great the world is! But one must look round in
it, and not stay in one spot."" And then she hopped into the kitchen
garden. ""How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!""

""I know that,"" said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, ""my leaf is
the largest here. It hides half the world from me, but I don't care
for the world.""

""Cluck, cluck!"" And some fowls came. They tripped about in the
cabbage garden. The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a long
sight. She spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and pecked
at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted
and writhed."
the-toad,13,"The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the
other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be.

""It doesn't do that with a good will,"" thought the Fowl, and
lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.

The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight
up towards the Fowl.

""Aha, it has allies,"" quoth the Fowl. ""Just look at the crawling
thing!"" And then the Fowl turned away. ""I don't care for the little
green morsel; it would only tickle my throat."" The other fowls took
the same view of it, and they all turned away together.

""I writhed myself free,"" said the Caterpillar. ""What a good
thing it is when one has presence of mind! But the hardest thing
remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again. Where is it?"""
the-toad,14,"And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy. She was
glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.

""What do you mean by that?"" cried the Caterpillar. ""I wriggled
myself free from the Fowl. You are very disagreeable to look at.
Cannot I be left in peace on my own property? Now I smell cabbage. Now
I am near my leaf. Nothing is so beautiful as property. But I must
go higher up.""

""Yes, higher up,"" said the little Toad; ""higher-up! She feels just
as I do; but she's not in a good humor to-day. That's because of the
fright. We all want to go higher up."" And she looked up as high as
ever she could.

The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house. He
clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.

""How high up they live!"" thought the Toad. ""If one could only
get as high as that!"""
the-toad,15,"In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet and
the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature. The one
sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and how it
was mirrored in his heart. He sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in
well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter
itself, and even cut it open where need was. He looked upon God's
creation as a great sum in arithmetic--subtracted, multiplied, and
tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding
concerning it; and that was a very sensible thing; and he spoke
joyously and cleverly of it. They were good, joyful men, those two.

""There sits a good specimen of a toad,"" said the naturalist. ""I
must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits.""

""You have two of them already,"" replied the poet. ""Let the thing
sit there and enjoy its life.""

""But it's so wonderfully ugly,"" persisted the first.

""Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,"" said the poet, ""I
too should be for cutting it open.""

""A jewel!"" cried the naturalist. ""You seem to know a great deal
about natural history.""

""But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that
just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry
the most precious jewel in its head? Is it not just the same thing
with men? What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still more,
Socrates!"""
the-toad,16,"The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of
what she had heard. The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped
the fate of being bottled up in spirits.

""Those two also were speaking of the jewel,"" said the Toad to
herself. ""What a good thing that I have not got it! I might have
been in a very disagreeable position.""

Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.
Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was
glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden."
the-toad,17,"""Man is the most conceited creature!"" said the Stork. ""Listen
how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly.
They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language! Yes, a fine
language truly! Why, it changes in every day's journey we make. One of
them doesn't understand another. Now, we can speak our language over
the whole earth--up in the North and in Egypt. And then men are not
able to fly, moreover. They rush along by means of an invention they
call 'railway;' but they often break their necks over it. It makes
my beak turn cold when I think of it. The world could get on without
men. We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs
and earth-worms.""

""That was a powerful speech,"" thought the little Toad. ""What a
great man that is yonder! and how high he sits! Higher than ever I saw
any one sit yet; and how he can swim!"" she cried, as the Stork
soared away through the air with outspread pinions."
the-toad,18,"And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told about
Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that was to
be found in that strange land; and all this sounded new and very
charming to the little Toad.

""I must go to Egypt!"" said she. ""If the Stork or one of his
young ones would only take me! I would oblige him in return. Yes, I
shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy! All the longing and all the
pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's
head.""

And it was just she who had the jewel. That jewel was the
continual striving and desire to go upward--ever upward. It gleamed in
her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her longing."
the-toad,19,"Then, suddenly, up came the Stork. He had seen the Toad in the
grass, and stooped down and seized the little creature anything but
gently. The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it was
not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward--upward towards
Egypt--and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark
seemed to fly out of them.

""Quunk!--ah!""

The body was dead--the Toad was killed! But the spark that had
shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?

The sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from the
head of the toad. Whither?"
the-toad,20,"Ask not the naturalist; rather ask the poet. He will tell it
thee under the guise of a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on the
cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story. Think! the
Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly; the
Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, and
yet finds the shortest way home to the same country--to the same roof.
Nay, that is almost too improbable; and yet it is true. You may ask
the naturalist, he will confess it is so; and you know it yourself,
for you have seen it.

But the jewel in the head of the toad?

Seek it in the sun; see it there if you can.

The brightness is too dazzling there. We have not yet such eyes as
can see into the glories which God has created, but we shall receive
them by-and-by; and that will be the most beautiful story of all,
and we shall all have our share in it."
the-toad-woman,1,"Great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone
in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog; for, to her
surprise, she found fresh meat every morning at her door. She was very
curious to know who it was that supplied her, and watching one morning,
just as the sun had risen, she saw a handsome young man gliding away
into the forest. Having seen her, he became her husband, and she had a
son by him.

One day, not long after this, he did not return at evening, as usual,
from hunting. She waited till late at night, but he came no more.

The next day, she swung her child to sleep in its cradle, and then said
to her dog, ""Take care of your brother while I am gone, and when he
cries, halloo for me.""

The cradle was made of the finest wampum, and all its bandages and
ornaments were of the same precious stuff."
the-toad-woman,2,"After a short time, the woman heard the cry of the dog, and running home
as fast as she could, she found her child gone, and the dog too. On
looking around, she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the wampum
of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and
had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had
been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea,
or the Toad-Woman.

The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along,
she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told
her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes
that she might follow on. There was a number of these old women who
seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long
beforehand. Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at
the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given
her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. The
young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes
she borrowed."
the-toad-woman,3,"She thus followed in the pursuit, from valley to valley, and stream to
stream, for many months and years; when she came at length to the lodge
of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who
gave her the last instructions how to proceed. She told her that she
was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her
to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge,
and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the
wild grape.

""Then,"" she said, ""your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find
you out.""

These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to
her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to
hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, ""Peewaubik--Spirit-Iron--Twee!
Twee!"""
the-toad-woman,4,"The dog soon came into the lodge, and she set before him the dish of
grape-juice.

""See, my child,"" she said, addressing him, ""the pretty drink your mother
gives you.""

Spirit-Iron took a long draught, and immediately left the lodge with his
eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth
of things as they are. He rose up when he got into the open air, stood
upon his hind legs, and looked about. ""I see how it is,"" he said; and
marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master.

Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his
ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was
listening), ""This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours. I
have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. When we come
back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you."""
the-toad-woman,5,"They went out into the woods, and at the close of the afternoon they
brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. The young man, as soon
as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, ""Send some
of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately.""

The Toad-Woman answered, ""No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!""

The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman
consented to take something and throw it down at the door. She called
out, ""My son gives you this."" But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea,
it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast
it out of the lodge after her.

In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of
cedar-boughs. She then told him that she was his real mother, and that
he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a
child-thief and a witch. As the young man appeared to doubt, she added,
""Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the
Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for
your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in
striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you."""
the-toad-woman,6,"They were real wampum, white and blue, shining and beautiful; and the
young man, placing them in his bosom, set off; but as he did not seem
quite steady in his belief of the strange woman's story, the dog
Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many
words of encouragement as they went along. They entered the lodge
together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye,
that trouble was coming.

""Mother,"" said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning
heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him,
""why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?""

""Oh,"" she answered, ""it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were
born; that is the reason.""

He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she
could do for him. He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his
cradle. She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said:

""That is not my cradle."""
the-toad-woman,7,"She went and got another of her own children's cradles, of which there
were four; but he turned his head, and said:

""That is not mine; I am as sick as ever.""

When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last
produced the real cradle. The young man saw that it was of the same
stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. He could even see the
marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had
taken hold, striving to hold it back. He had no doubt, now, which was
his mother.

To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man
should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very
wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and
having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the
carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west.
Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear
was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the
end of the earth, to get it. She answered:

""It is not so far but that I can get it;"" for of all things in the
world, a fat bear was the delight of the old Toad-Woman."
the-toad-woman,8,"She at once set forth; and she was no sooner out of sight than the young
man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the
Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends),
they put out their life. They then set them up by the side of the door,
having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths.

The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been
sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she
was able to climb to the carcass. She slipped down three times where she
went up once. When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she
drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing
up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. She was angry with
them, and called out:

""Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?"""
the-toad-woman,9,"She was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint; but
when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock
her, her fury was very great indeed. She ran after the tracks of the
young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she
was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron,
coming close up to his master, whispered to him--""Snakeberry!""

""Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her!"" cried out the young man;
and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a
long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these
berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick
and eat.

The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the
snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow
and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old
Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to
get beyond to the other side, to disturb the happiness of the young
hunter and his mother, who still live, with their faithful dog, in the
shadow of the beautiful wood-side where they were born."
the-top-and-ball,1,"A whipping top and a little ball lay together in a box, among
other toys, and the top said to the ball, ""Shall we be married, as
we live in the same box?""

But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought
as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even
condescend to reply.

The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings
belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a
brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was
spinning round it looked splendid."
the-top-and-ball,2,"""Look at me,"" said the top to the ball. ""What do you say now?
Shall we be engaged to each other? We should suit so well; you spring,
and I dance. No one could be happier than we should be.""

""Indeed! do you think so? Perhaps you do not know that my father
and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my
body.""

""Yes; but I am made of mahogany,"" said the top. ""The major himself
turned me. He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great
amusement to him."""
the-top-and-ball,3,"Next day the ball was taken out by the boy. The top saw it
flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of
sight. Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a
higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards, or
from having a Spanish cork in its body. But the ninth time it rose
in the air, it remained away, and did not return. The boy searched
everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found;
it was gone.

""I know very well where she is,"" sighed the top; ""she is in the
swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."""
the-top-and-ball,4,"The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball.
His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; and
that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all. The
top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the
ball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to
his fancy."
the-top-and-ball,5,"Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old. The
top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked
handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over. He was now a golden
top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was
something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then
he, also, was gone. They searched everywhere, even in the cellar,
but he was nowhere to be found. Where could he be? He had jumped
into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying:
cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the
gutter under the roof."
the-top-and-ball,6,"""Now I am in a nice place,"" said he; ""my gilding will soon be
washed off here. Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!""
And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple,
which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk. It was, however, not an
apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter, and
was soaked through with water."
the-top-and-ball,7,"""Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can
talk,"" said the ball, examining the gilded top. ""I am made of
morocco,"" she said. ""I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a
Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now.
I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from the gutter
under the roof, and I have lain here more than five years, and have
been thoroughly drenched. Believe me, it is a long time for a young
maiden."""
the-top-and-ball,8,"The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the more
she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball.

The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin.

""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top."" So the top was
brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the
little ball. He spoke not a word about his old love; for that soon
died away. When the beloved object has lain for five years in a
gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her
again on meeting her in a dust-bin."
the-two-jeebi,1,"There lived a hunter in the North, who had a wife and one child. His
lodge stood far off in the forest, several days' journey from any other.
He spent his days in hunting, and his evenings in relating to his wife
the incidents that had befallen him. As game was very abundant, he found
no difficulty in killing as much as they wanted. Just in all his acts,
he lived a peaceful and happy life.

One evening during the winter season, it chanced that he remained out
longer than usual, and his wife began to fear that some accident had
befallen him. It was already dark. She listened attentively, and at last
heard the sound of approaching footsteps.

Not doubting that it was her husband, she went to the door and beheld
two strange females. She bade them enter, and invited them to remain.
She observed that they were total strangers in the country. There was
something so peculiar in their looks, air and manner, that she was
disturbed by their presence. They would not come near to the fire. They
sat in a remote part of the lodge, shy and taciturn, and drew their
garments about them in such a manner as nearly to hide their faces. So
far as she could judge, they were pale, hollow-eyed, and long-visaged,
very thin and emaciated."
the-two-jeebi,2,"There was but little light in the lodge, as the fire was low, and its
fitful flashes, by disclosing their white faces and then dropping them
in sudden darkness, served rather to increase than to dispel her fears.

""Merciful Spirit!"" cried a voice from the opposite part of the lodge;
""there are two corpses clothed with garments!""

The hunter's wife turned around, but seeing nobody save her little
child, staring across from under his blanket, she said to herself, ""The
boy can not speak; the sounds were but the gusts of wind."" She trembled,
and was ready to sink to the earth.

Her husband at this moment entered, and in some measure relieved her
alarm. He threw down the carcass of a large fat deer.

""Behold what a fine and fat animal!"" cried the mysterious females; and
they immediately ran and pulled off pieces of the whitest fat, which
they greedily devoured."
the-two-jeebi,3,"The hunter and his wife looked on with astonishment, but remained
silent. They supposed that their guests might have been stricken with
famine.

The next day, however, the same unusual conduct was repeated. The
strange females again tore off the fat and devoured it with eagerness.
The third day, the hunter thought that he would anticipate their wants
by tying up a share of the hunt, and placing it apart for their express
use. They accepted it, but still appeared dissatisfied, and went to the
wife's portion and tore off more.

The hunter and his wife were surprised at such rude and unaccountable
conduct, but they remained silent, for they respected their guests, and
had observed that they had been attended with marked good luck during
the sojourn of these mysterious visitors in their lodge.

In other respects, the deportment of the females was strictly
unexceptionable. They were modest, distant, and silent. They never
uttered a word during the day. At night they would occupy themselves in
procuring wood, which they carried to the lodge, and then, restoring the
implements exactly where they had found them, resume their places
without speaking. They were never known to stay out until daylight. They
never laughed or jested."
the-two-jeebi,4,"The winter was nearly passed away, when, one evening, the hunter was
abroad later than usual. The moment he came in and laid down his day's
hunt, as was his custom, before his wife, the two females seized upon
the deer and began to tear off the fat in so unceremonious a way that
her anger was excited. She constrained herself, however, in a good
degree, but she could not conceal her feelings, though she said but
little.

The strange guests observed the state of her mind, and they became
uneasy, and withdrew further still into the remote gloom of the lodge.
The good hunter saw the eclipse that was darkening the quiet of his
lodge, and carefully inquired of its cause; but his wife denied having
used any words of complaining or reproach.

They retired to their couches, and the hunter tried to compose himself
to sleep, but could not, for the sighs and sobs of the two females were
incessant. He arose on his couch and addressed them as follows:

""Tell me,"" said he, ""what is it that gives you pain of mind and causes
you to bemoan your presence here. Has my wife given you offense, or
trespassed upon the rights of hospitality?"""
the-two-jeebi,5,"They replied in the negative. ""We have been treated by you with kindness
and affection. It is not for any slight we have received that we weep.
Our mission is not to you only. We come from the other land to test
mankind, and to try the sincerity of the living. Often we have heard the
bereaved by death say that if the lost could be restored, they would
devote their lives to make them happy. We have been moved by the bitter
lamentations which have reached the place of the departed, and have
come to make proof of the sincerity of those who have lost friends. We
are your two dead sisters. Three moons were allotted us by the Master of
Life to make the trial. More than half the time had been successfully
passed, when the angry feelings of your wife indicated the irksomeness
you felt at our presence, and has made us resolve on our departure.""

They continued to talk to the hunter and his wife, gave them
instructions as to a future life, and pronounced a blessing upon them."
the-two-jeebi,6,"""There is one point,"" they added, ""of which we wish to speak. You have
thought our conduct very strange and rude in possessing ourselves of the
choicest parts of your hunt. _That_ was the point of trial selected to
put you to. It is the wife's peculiar privilege. You love your wife. For
another to usurp what belongs to her, we know to be the severest test of
her goodness of heart, and consequently of your temper and feelings. We
knew your manners and customs, but we came to prove you, not by
complying with but by violating them. Pardon us. We are the agents of
him who sent us. Peace to your dwelling. Farewell!""

When they ceased, total darkness filled the lodge. No object could be
seen. The inmates heard the lodge-door open and shut, but they never saw
more of the Two Spirits.

The hunter found the success which they had promised. He became
celebrated in the chase, and never wanted for any thing. He had many
children, all of whom grew up to manhood; and he who had lain in the
lodge, a little child, while the Jeebi dwelt there, led them in all good
deeds, and health, peace, and long life were the rewards of the hunter's
hospitality."
the-two-scholars,1,"Once upon a time there were two scholars. One was named Liu Tschen andthe other Yuan Dschau. Both were young and handsome. One spring daythey went together into the hills of Tian Tai to gather curativeherbs. There they came to a little valley where peach-trees blossomedluxuriantly on either side. In the middle of the valley was a cave,where two maidens stood under the blossoming trees, one of them cladin red garments, the other in green. And they were beautiful beyondall telling. They beckoned to the scholars with their hands."
the-two-scholars,2,"""And have you come?"" they asked. ""We have been waiting for youoverlong!""Then they led them into the cave and served them with tea and wine.""I have been destined for the lord Liu,"" said the maiden in the redgown; ""and my sister is for the lord Yuan!"""
the-two-scholars,3,"And so they were married. Every day the two scholars gazed at theflowers or played chess so that they forgot the mundane worldcompletely. They only noticed that at times the peach-blossoms on thetrees before the cave opened, and at others that they fell from theboughs. And, at times, unexpectedly, they felt cold or warm, and hadto change the clothing they were wearing. And they marveled withinthemselves that it should be so."
the-two-scholars,4,"Then, one day, they were suddenly overcome by homesickness. Bothmaidens were already aware of it.""When our lords have once been seized with homesickness, then we mayhold them no longer,"" said they.On the following day they prepared a farewell banquet, gave thescholars magic wine to take along with them and said:""We will see one another again. Now go your way!""And the scholars bade them farewell with tears."
the-two-scholars,5,"When they reached home the gates and doors had long since vanished,and the people of the village were all strangers to them. They crowdedabout the scholars and asked who they might be.""We are Liu Tschen and Yuan Dschau. Only a few days ago we went intothe hills to pick herbs!""With that a servant came hastening up and looked at them. At last hefell at Liu Tschen's feet with great joy and cried: ""Yes, you arereally my master! Since you went away, and we had no news of any kindregarding you some seventy years or more have passed."""
the-two-scholars,6,"Thereupon he drew the scholar Liu through a high gateway, ornamentedwith bosses and a ring in a lion's mouth, as is the custom in thedwellings of those of high estate.And when he entered the hall, an old lady with white hair and bentback, leaning on a cane, came forward and asked: ""What man is this?""""Our master has returned again,"" replied the servant. And then,turning to Liu he added: ""That is the mistress. She is nearly ahundred years old, but fortunately is still strong and in goodhealth.""Tears of joy and sadness filled the old lady's eyes."
the-two-scholars,7,"""Since you went away among the immortals, I had thought that we shouldnever see each other again in this life,"" said she. ""What great goodfortune that you should have returned after all!""And before she had ended the whole family, men and women, camestreaming up and welcomed him in a great throng outside the hall.And his wife pointed out this one and that and said: ""That is so andso, and this is so and so!"""
the-two-scholars,8,"At the time the scholar had disappeared there had been only a tiny boyin his home, but a few years old. And he was now an old man of eighty.He had served the empire in a high office, and had already retired toenjoy his old age in the ancestral gardens. There were threegrand-children, all celebrated ministers; there were more than tengreat-grand-children, of whom five had already passed their examinationsfor the doctorate; there were some twenty great-great-grand-children, ofwhom the oldest had just returned home after having passed his inductionexaminations for the magistracy with honor. And the little ones, whowere carried in their parents' arms, were not to be counted."
the-two-scholars,9,"Thegrand-children, who were away, busy with their duties, all asked forleave and returned home when they heard that their ancestor hadreturned. And the girl grand-children, who had married into otherfamilies, also came. This filled Liu with joy, and he had a familybanquet prepared in the hall, and all his descendants, with their wivesand husbands sat about him in a circle. He himself and his wife, awhite-haired, wrinkled old lady, sat in their midst at the upper end.The scholar himself still looked like a youth of twenty years, so thatall the young people in the circle looked around and laughed."
the-two-scholars,10,"Then the scholar said: ""I have a means of driving away old age!""And he drew out his magic wine and gave his wife some of it to drink.And when she had taken three glasses, her white hair gradually turnedblack again, her wrinkles disappeared, and she sat beside her husband,a handsome young woman. Then his son and the older grand-childrencame up and all asked for a drink of the wine. And whichever of themdrank only so much as a drop of it was turned from an old man into ayouth. The tale was bruited abroad and came to the emperor's ears. Theemperor wanted to call Liu to his court, but he declined with manythanks. Yet he sent the emperor some of his magic wine as a gift. Thispleased the emperor greatly, and he gave Liu a tablet of honor, withthe inscription:    ""The Common Home of Five Generations""Besides this he sent him three signs which he had written with his ownimperial brush signifying:    ""Joy in longevity"""
the-two-scholars,11,"As to the other of the two scholars, Yuan Dschau, he was not sofortunate. When he came home he found that his wife and child had longsince died, and his grand-children and great-grand-children weremostly useless people. So he did not remain long, but returned to thehills. Yet Liu Tschen remained for some years with his family, thentaking his wife with him, went again to the Tai Hills and was seen nomore."
the-ugly-duckling,1,"It was very pleasant out in the country. It was summer time, the corn was yellow, the oats green, the hay was stacked down in the green meadows, and there the stork walked about on his long red legs and talked Egyptian. He had learnt the language from his mother. Round the fields and meadows there were large woods and within them deep lakes: indeed, it was pleasant out in the country. Full in the sunshine, an old manor house stood, surrounded by a deep moat, and from the base of the walls right down to the water great dock plants grew--so tall that a little child could stand upright under the largest of them. It was as lonely in among them as in the thickest wood; and there a Duck was sitting on her nest. She had got to hatch out her little Ducklings, but by this time she was well nigh tired out, they took so long about it, and she had very few callers. The other Ducks preferred swimming about the moat to coming up and sitting under a dock-leaf to chat with her."
the-ugly-duckling,2,"At last, one egg after another cracked, and said: ""Pip! pip!"" All the egg-yolks had come to life and were sticking their heads out.

""Quack, quack!"" said she, and they said it too, as well as they could, and looked all round them beneath the green leaves; and their mother let them look as much as they liked, for green is good for the eyes.

""What a big place the world is,"" said all the young ones: for to be sure they had a great deal more room now than when they lay in the egg.

""Do you suppose this is all the world?"" said their mother; ""why, it stretches out far beyond the other side of the garden, right into the parson's field--but I've never been there. You're all there, I suppose?"" and she got up. ""No, that's not all; there lies the biggest egg still. How long will it take? I'm really almost sick of it,"" and with that she sat down again."
the-ugly-duckling,3,"""Well, how goes it?"" asked an elderly Duck who came to call on her. ""Oh, this one egg takes a dreadful long time,"" said the sitting Duck; ""it won't break. But just you look at the others! They are the sweetest Ducklings I've ever seen; they're all just like their wretch of a father, who never comes to see me.""

""Let me look at the egg that won't hatch,"" said the old Duck; ""you may be sure that's a turkey's egg. I was made a fool of once that way, and I had my share of trouble and anxiety with the young ones, I can tell you, for they are afraid of the water. I couldn't get them to go in! I quacked and I pecked, but it was no good. Let me see the egg. Ah, yes, that's a turkey's egg; you just let it lie and teach the rest to swim.""

""Oh, I'll just sit on it a bit longer,"" said the Duck. ""As I've sat so long, I may as well give it a Whitsun week!"" [1] ""Just as you please,"" said the old Duck, and walked off.

At last the big egg opened. ""Pip! pip!"" said the young one, scrambling out; he was very big and ugly. The Duck looked at him: ""That's a fearfully big Duckling, that is,"" she said. ""None of the others look like that. I suppose it can't be a turkey poult! Well, we'll soon see; into the water he shall go, if I have to kick him out myself."""
the-ugly-duckling,4,"Next day the weather was perfectly delicious: the sun shone all over the green docks, and the mother Duck and all her family came out, and down to the moat. Splash! Into the water went she. ""Quack, quack!"" she said, and one Duckling after another plumped in. The water went over their heads, but they were up again in a moment and swam beautifully. Their legs worked of themselves, and now they were all out in the water, and even the ugly grey one was swimming with them. ""No, no, that's no turkey,"" she said. ""Look how nicely he uses his legs, and how well he holds himself up. That's my own child! He's really quite handsome if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! Come along with me and I'll take you out into the world and introduce you to the duck-yard, but mind and keep close to me so that nobody can tread on you, and do look out for the cat."""
the-ugly-duckling,5,"So they went into the duck-yard. There was a terrible commotion there, for two families were quarrelling over an eel's head--which the cat got after all."
the-ugly-duckling,6,"""Look, that's the way the world goes,"" said the mother Duck--her beak watering a little, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. ""Now then, use your legs,"" she said; ""mind and look alive, and stoop your necks to the old Duck over there, she's the most distinguished person here; she's of Spanish descent, so she's something special, and you see she's got a red rag round her leg. That is an extraordinarily splendid thing, the greatest distinction any duck can have; it means that people can't do without her, and she must be recognized by animals and men alike. Now then, look alive! Don't turn your toes in! A duckling that's properly brought up keeps its legs wide apart, like father and mother. Look here! Now then! Make a bow and say quack."""
the-ugly-duckling,7,"So they did; but the other ducks round them looked at them and said, quite loud, ""Look there! Now we've got to have all this mob on the top of us, as if there weren't enough of us already; and poof! what an object that duckling is! We can't stand him""; and a duck rushed at him and bit him in the neck."
the-ugly-duckling,8,"""Let him be,"" said his mother; ""he isn't doing any harm."" ""Yes, but he's too big and odd altogether,"" said the duck who had bitten him; ""so he's got to be smacked.""

""Those are pretty ducklings that mother has,"" said the old Duck with the rag on her leg; ""all quite pretty except that one. He hasn't been a success; I could wish the mother would alter him.""

""That can't be done, your grace,"" said the mother Duck. ""He's not handsome, but he has a really good disposition, and swims as nicely as any of the rest, even better, I venture to say. I believe he will grow handsome, or perhaps in time he will grow even somewhat smaller; he has lain too long in the egg, and so has not acquired a proper shape."" And she picked at his neck and smoothed him down. ""Besides, he's a drake,"" she went on, ""so it doesn't matter quite so much. He has, I believe, a good constitution and will win through in the end.""

""The other ducklings are charming,"" said the old lady. ""Well, make yourselves at home, and if you happen to find an eel's head, you can bring it to me."""
the-ugly-duckling,9,"So they made themselves at home: but the poor Duckling who had come last out of the egg and looked so ugly, was bitten and buffeted and made to look a fool by the hens and the ducks alike. ""He's too big,"" they all said; and the turkey cock, who was born with spurs, and considered himself an emperor on the strength of it, blew himself up like a ship under full sail and went straight at the Duckling, gobbling and getting quite red in the head. The poor Duckling didn't know where to stay or which way to go, he was so miserable at being ugly and the butt of the whole duck-yard."
the-ugly-duckling,10,"That was the first day, and as time went on it got worse and worse. The wretched Duckling was chased about by everybody, and even his mother and sisters were nasty to him, and kept saying: ""I wish the cat would get you, you ugly devil."" And his mother said: ""I wish you'd get right away""; and the ducks bit him and the hens pecked him, and the maid who had to feed the creatures kicked at him. So he ran away, and flew over the fence. The little birds in the bushes shot up in the air in a fright. ""That's because I'm so ugly,"" the Duckling thought, and shut his eyes, but ran on all the same, till he got out into the wide marsh where the wild-duck lived; and there he lay all night, for he was very tired and very unhappy."
the-ugly-duckling,11,"In the morning the wild-duck flew up and caught sight of their new comrade. ""What sort of a chap are you?"" they asked; and the Duckling turned to this side and that and greeted them as well as he could. ""You're precious ugly,"" said the wild-ducks; ""but that doesn't matter to us as long as you don't marry into our family."" Poor wretch! He wasn't thinking much about marrying, as long as he could be allowed to lie among the reeds, and drink a little marsh water. There he lay two whole days, and then came a pair of wild geese (or rather wild ganders, for they were both he's): they hadn't been hatched out very long, and so they were particularly lively. ""Here, mate,"" they said, ""you're so ugly I quite like you. Will you come along and be a migrant? Close by in another marsh there's some sweet pretty wild geese--all young ladies that can say Quack. You're so ugly you could make your fortune with them."""
the-ugly-duckling,12,"At that moment there was a Bang! Bang! and both the wild geese fell dead among the reeds, and the water was stained blood red. Another bang! bang! and whole flights of geese flew up from the reeds, and there was yet another bang! a great shoot was afoot. The sportsmen were all round the marsh, some even sitting up among the branches of trees that stretched out over the reeds. The blue smoke drifted like clouds, in among the dark stems, and hung far out over the water. The dogs went splash! splash! into the mud, and the reeds and rushes swayed hither and thither; it was terrible for the wretched Duckling, who was bending his neck to get it under his wing, when all at once, close to him, there was a fearful big dog with his tongue hanging right out of his mouth and his eyes shining horribly. He thrust his muzzle right at the Duckling and showed his sharp teeth--and then--splash! Off he went without seizing him."
the-ugly-duckling,13,"""Oh, thank goodness,"" sighed the Duckling; ""I'm so ugly, even the dog doesn't like to bite me!"" But there he lay perfectly still while the duck shots rattled in the reeds and gun after gun banged out. It was well on in the day before all was quiet, but the unhappy bird dared not get up even then. He waited several hours yet, before he looked about him, and then he hurried away from the marsh as fast as ever he could, running over fields and meadows, and such a wind got up that he had hard work to get along. Towards evening he was near a poor little cottage, so crazy was it that it didn't know which way to tumble down, so it remained standing. The wind howled so fiercely round the Duckling that he had to sit down on his tail to keep facing it, and it grew worse and worse. Then he noticed that one hinge of the door was gone, and it hung so crooked that he could slip indoors through the crack, and so he did."
the-ugly-duckling,14,"Here lived an old woman with a cat and a hen. The cat, whom she called Sonny, could set up his fur and purr, and also throw out sparks, but for this he had to be stroked backwards. The Hen had very short little legs, and was consequently called ""chicky short legs"". She laid good eggs, and the woman was as fond of her as of a child of her own."
the-ugly-duckling,15,"Next morning the strange Duckling was noticed at once, and the cat began to purr, and the Hen to cluck. ""What's the matter?"" said the old woman, looking all about her. But her sight wasn't good, so she took the Duckling for a fat duck that had strayed away. ""That's a splendid catch,"" she said: ""now I can have duck eggs, if only it isn't a drake! We must make sure of that."" So the Duckling was taken in on approval for three weeks, but no eggs came."
the-ugly-duckling,16,"The Cat was the gentleman of the house and the Hen the lady, and they always talked of ""we and the world""; for they considered that they were half the world, and much the best half. It seemed to the Duckling that some people might think differently, but this the Hen could not tolerate."
the-ugly-duckling,17,"""Can you lay eggs?"" she asked. ""No! Then will you kindly hold your tongue.""

And the Cat said: ""Can you put up your fur, or purr, or give out sparks? No! Then you've no call to have an opinion when sensible people are talking.""

So the Duckling lay in a corner and was in the lowest spirits. He began to think of the fresh air and sunshine, and such a strange longing to swim in the water came on him that he could not help telling the Hen.

""What's the matter with you?"" she asked. ""You've nothing to do, that's why you get these fancies; you just lay some eggs, or purr, and they'll pass off."" ""But it is so delicious to float on the water,"" said the Duckling; ""so lovely to get it over your head and dive right down to the bottom.""

""Oh yes, most delightful, of course!"" said the Hen. ""Why, you're absolutely mad! Ask the Cat--he's the cleverest man I know--whether he enjoys floating on the water or diving down; I say nothing of myself. Why, ask your mistress, the old woman; there's no one in the world cleverer than her--do you suppose she wants to go swimming and getting the water over her head?"""
the-ugly-duckling,18,"""You don't understand me,"" said the Duckling.

""Well, if we don't understand you, who is going to understand you, pray? You'll never be cleverer than the Cat and the woman, to say nothing of me. Don't give yourself airs, child, but thank your Maker for all the kindness people have done you. Don't you live in a warm room among company you can learn something from? But there! You're a rubbishy thing, and there's little entertainment in your company. You may take it from me! I mean well by you, and I'm telling you home truths, and that's how people can see their true friends. Now just do take pains to lay eggs, or learn to purr or else give sparks.""

""I think I'll go out into the wide world,"" said the Duckling.

""Very well, do,"" said the Hen."
the-ugly-duckling,19,So the Duckling went off and swam on the water and dived into it; but he was looked down upon by all the creatures because of his ugliness.
the-ugly-duckling,20,"Autumn now came on: the leaves of the wood turned brown and yellow, the wind caught them and made them dance about, and above the sky looked cold, where the clouds hung heavy with hail and snow, and on the fence the raven perched and cried ""Caw! Caw!"" for the mere cold. Indeed, it regularly gave you the shivers to think of it. The unhappy Duckling had a very hard time."
the-ugly-duckling,21,"One evening, when there was a lovely sunset, a whole flock of beautiful great birds rose out of the bushes. The Duckling had never seen any so handsome. They were brilliantly white, with long supple necks. They were swans, and they uttered a strange sound and spread their splendid long wings and flew far away from the cold region to warmer lands, and unfrozen lakes. They mounted so high, so high that the ugly little Duckling was strangely moved; he whirled himself round in the water like a wheel, he stretched his neck straight up into the air after them and uttered such a loud cry, so strange, that he was quite frightened at it himself. Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those wonderful birds! And the moment they were out of sight he dived right down to the bottom of the water, and when he came up again he was almost beside himself. He didn't know what the birds were called or which way they were flying, but he loved them as he had never loved anything yet. He was not envious of them--how could it enter his mind to wish for such beauty for himself--he would have been happy if even the ducks had let him into their company--poor ugly creature."
the-ugly-duckling,22,"The winter grew very very cold: the Duckling was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing quite over, but every night the hole he swam in became smaller and smaller. It froze so hard that the ice cracked again; the Duckling had always to be moving about to keep the water open, till at last he was tired out and sat still, and was frozen fast in the ice."
the-ugly-duckling,23,"Early in the morning a labourer came that way, saw him, went on the ice and with his wooden shoe broke it up and carried the Duckling home to his wife, and there he was brought to life again. The children wanted to play with him, but he thought they meant to hurt him, and in his fright he dashed right into the milk-pan and made the milk splash out into the room. The woman screamed and threw up her hands. Then he flew into the butter-tub and after that into the meal-bin and out again. Goodness, what a sight he was! The woman screamed out and hit at him with the tongs, and the children tumbled over one another trying to catch him, laughing, calling out--by good luck the door stood open, and out he rushed into the bushes, on the new fallen snow, and there he lay almost in a swoon."
the-ugly-duckling,24,"But it would be too sad to tell of all the hardships and miseries which he had to go through in that hard winter. When the sun began once more to shine out warm and the larks to sing, he was lying among the reeds in the marsh, and it was the beautiful spring. Then all at once he lifted his wings, and they rustled more strongly than before, and bore him swiftly away; and before he knew it he was in a spacious garden where were apple trees in blossom, and sweet-smelling lilacs hung on long green boughs right down to the winding moat. Oh, it was lovely here, and fresh with spring; and straight in front of him, out of the shadows, came three beautiful white swans with rustling plumage floating lightly on the water. The Duckling recognized the splendid creatures, and a strange sorrowfulness came over him."
the-ugly-duckling,25,"""I will fly to them, these royal birds, and they will peck me to death because I, who am so ugly, dare to approach them; but it doesn't matter; it's better to be killed by them than to be snapped at by the ducks and pecked at by hens and kicked by the servant who looks after the poultry-yard, and suffer all the winter."" So he flew out into the open water and swam towards the stately swans, and they saw him and hastened with swelling plumage to meet him. ""Yes, kill me,"" the poor creature said, bowing his head down to the water, and waited for death. But what did he see in the clear water? He beheld his own image, but it was no longer that of a clumsy dark grey bird, ugly and repulsive. He was a swan himself."
the-ugly-duckling,26,"It doesn't matter in the least whether you are born in the duck-yard, if only you've lain in a swan's egg."
the-ugly-duckling,27,"It really delighted him now to think of all the hardships and adversities he had suffered, now he could rightly discern his good fortune and all the beauty that greeted him. The great swans swam round him and caressed him with their bills. Some little children now came into the garden and threw bread and corn into the water, and the smallest of them cried: ""There's a new one!"" And the others called out in delight: ""Yes, there's a new one come!"" They clapped their hands and danced about and ran to their father and mother. More bread and cake was thrown into the water, and everyone said: ""The new one is the handsomest of all; how young and beautiful he is!"" And the elder swans bowed before him."
the-ugly-duckling,28,"At that he felt quite ill at ease, and covered his head with his wings, and knew not what to do. He was more than happy, and yet not proud, for a good heart is never puffed up. He thought how persecuted and depressed he had been, yet now he heard everyone saying he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds. And the lilacs bowed their branches down to the water, and the sun shone warm and pleasant, and his plumage ruffled, and he raised his slender neck, and from his heart he said joyfully: ""Such happiness I never dreamed of when I was the Ugly Duckling."""
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,1,"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast, and supported themselves by fishing. They had only one child, a son, who was their pride and joy, and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long, and never felt tired or discontented with their lot. This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up.' But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks, and as he was really very clever in managing a boat, the old people were very seldom anxious about him."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,2,"One beautiful bright morning, as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat, he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle. He was delighted with his prize, and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home, when suddenly the turtle found its voice, and tremblingly begged for its life. 'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer. Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude.'

Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,3,"Years flew by, and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea. But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves. Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate. But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore. Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: 'I am the turtle whose life you once saved. I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude. The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there. Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will.' Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend's help. But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell, when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once, but go under the sea, and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,4,"Uraschimataro agreed willingly, and in another moment they were deep, deep down, with fathoms of blue water above their heads. Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls. But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside, he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within, which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales.

'Where have you brought me?' he asked his guide in a low voice.

'To the palace of Ringu, the house of the sea god, whose subjects we all are,' answered the turtle. 'I am the first waiting maid of his daughter, the lovely princess Otohime, whom you will shortly see.'"
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,5,"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him, that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next. But the turtle, who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him, went at once to make known his arrival. And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade. 'Is not that reward enough?' she asked, smiling, looking all the while as fair as the sun itself. And Uraschimataro said 'Yes,' and so he stayed there. For how long? That he only knew later."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,6,"His life passed by, and each hour seemed happier than the last, when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents. He fought against it hard, knowing how it would grieve the princess, but it grew on him stronger and stronger, till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong. Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home, and that he must see his parents once more. The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. 'You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more,' she moaned bitterly. But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, 'Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever.' Sadly the princess shook her head, but she answered slowly, 'One way there is to bring you safely back, but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain.'"
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,7,"'I will do anything that will bring me back to you,' exclaimed Uraschimataro, looking at her tenderly, but the princess was silent: she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more. Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. 'If you can do this,' she said as she bade him farewell, 'your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore, and will carry you back to me.'

Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess. Three days and three nights they swam through the sea, and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home. The turtle bade him farewell, and was gone in a moment."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,8,"Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps. He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.

Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.

Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old. But when the man spoke, he knew he was not dreaming, though he felt as if he had lost his senses."
the-uraschimataro-and-the-turtle,9,"In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess. Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true. He might be the victim of some enchanter's spell, and in his hand lay the counter-charm. Almost unconsciously he opened it, and a purple vapour came pouring out. He held the empty box in his hand, and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled, like the hand of an old, old man. He ran to the brook, which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain. and saw himself reflected as in a mirror. It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him. Wounded to death, he crept back through the village, and no man knew the old, old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before. So he toiled wearily back, till he reached the shore, and here he sat sadly on a rock, and called loudly on the turtle. But she never came back any more, but instead, death came soon, and set him free. But before that happened, the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story, and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea, and the most beautiful woman in the world besides."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,1,"There was once upon a time a man and his wife who had an old cat and an
old dog. One day the man, whose name was Simon, said to his wife, whose
name was Susan, 'Why should we keep our old cat any longer? She never
catches any mice now-a-days, and is so useless that I have made up my
mind to drown her.'

But his wife replied, 'Don't do that, for I'm sure she could still catch
mice.'

'Rubbish,' said Simon. 'The mice might dance on her and she would never
catch one. I've quite made up my mind that the next time I see her, I
shall put her in the water.'"
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,2,"Susan was very unhappy when she heard this, and so was the cat, who had
been listening to the conversation behind the stove. When Simon went
off to his work, the poor cat miawed so pitifully, and looked up so
pathetically into Susan's face, that the woman quickly opened the door. She said, 'Fly for your life, my poor little beast, and get well away
from here before your master returns.'

The cat took her advice, and ran as quickly as her poor old legs would
carry her into the wood. When Simon came home, his wife told him
that the cat had vanished."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,3,"'So much the better for her,' said Simon. 'And now we have got rid of
her, we must consider what we are to do with the old dog. He is quite
deaf and blind, and invariably barks when there is no need, and makes no
sound when there is. I think the best thing I can do with him is to hang
him.'

But soft-hearted Susan replied, 'Please don't do so. He's surely not so
useless as all that.'

'Don't be foolish,' said her husband. 'The courtyard might be full of
thieves and he'd never discover it. No, the first time I see him, it's
all up with him, I can tell you.'"
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,4,"Susan was very unhappy at his words, and so was the dog, who was lying
in the corner of the room and had heard everything. As soon as Simon
had gone to his work, he stood up and howled so touchingly that Susan
quickly opened the door. She said 'Fly for your life, poor beast, before
your master gets home.' And the dog ran into the wood with his tail
between his legs.

When her husband returned, his wife told him that the dog had
disappeared.

'That's lucky for him,' said Simon, but Susan sighed, for she had been
very fond of the poor creature."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,5,"Now it happened that the cat and dog met each other on their travels. Though they had not been the best of friends at home, they were
quite glad to meet among strangers. They sat down under a holly tree and
both poured forth their woes.

Presently a fox passed by, and saw the pair sitting together in a
disconsolate fashion. He asked them why they sat there, and what they
were grumbling about.

The cat replied, 'I have caught many a mouse in my day. Now that I
am old and past work, my master wants to drown me.'

And the dog said, 'Many a night have I watched and guarded my master's
house. Now that I am old and deaf, he wants to hang me.'

The fox answered, 'That's the way of the world. But I'll help you to get
back into your master's favour, only you must first help me in my own
troubles.'"
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,6,"They promised to do their best, and the fox continued, 'The wolf has
declared war against me, and is at this moment marching to meet me in
company with the bear and the wild boar. To-morrow there will be a
fierce battle between us.'

'All right,' said the dog and the cat, 'we will stand by you, and if we
are killed, it is at any rate better to die on the field of battle
than to perish ignobly at home,' and they shook paws and concluded the
bargain. The fox sent word to the wolf to meet him at a certain place,
and the three set forth to encounter him and his friends."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,7,"The wolf, the bear, and the wild boar arrived on the spot first, and
when they had waited some time for the fox, the dog, and the cat, the
bear said, 'I'll climb up into the oak tree, and look if I can see them
coming.'

The first time he looked round he said, 'I can see nothing.' The
second time he looked round he said, 'I can still see nothing.' But the
third time he said, 'I see a mighty army in the distance, and one of the
warriors has the biggest lance you ever saw!'

This was the cat, who was marching along with her tail erect."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,8,"And so they laughed and jeered, and it was so hot that the bear said,
'The enemy won't be here at this rate for many hours to come. I'll
just curl myself up in the fork of the tree and have a little sleep.'

And the wolf lay down under the oak, and the wild boar buried himself in
some straw, so that nothing was seen of him but one ear.

And while they were lying there, the fox, the cat and the dog arrived.
When the cat saw the wild boar's ear, she pounced upon it, thinking it
was a mouse in the straw."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,9,"The wild boar got up in a dreadful fright, gave one loud grunt and
disappeared into the wood. But the cat was even more startled than the
boar, and, spitting with terror, she scrambled up into the fork of the
tree, and as it happened right into the bear's face. Now it was the
bear's turn to be alarmed, and with a mighty growl he jumped down from
the oak and fell right on the top of the wolf and killed him as dead as
a stone.

On their way home from the war the fox caught score of mice, and when
they reached Simon's cottage he put them all on the stove and said to
the cat, 'Now go and fetch one mouse after the other, and lay them down
before your master.'

'All right,' said the cat, and did exactly as the fox told her."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,10,"When Susan saw this she said to her husband, 'Just look, here is our old
cat back again, and see what a lot of mice she has caught.'

'Wonders will never cease,' cried Simon. 'I certainly never thought the
old cat would ever catch another mouse.'

But Susan answered, 'There, you see, I always said our cat was a most
excellent creature--but you men always think you know best.'

In the meantime the fox said to the dog, 'Our friend Simon has just
killed a pig. When it gets a little darker, you must go into the
courtyard and bark with all your might.'

'All right,' said the dog, and as soon as it grew dusk he began to bark
loudly."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,11,"Susan, who heard him first, said to her husband, 'Our dog must have
come back, for I hear him barking lustily. Do go out and see what's the
matter. Perhaps thieves may be stealing our sausages.'

But Simon answered, 'The foolish brute is as deaf as a post and is
always barking at nothing,' and he refused to get up."
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,12,"The next morning Susan got up early to go to church at the neighbouring
town, and she thought she would take some sausages to her aunt who lived
there. But when she went to her larder, she found all the sausages gone,
and a great hole in the floor. She called out to her husband, 'I was
perfectly right. Thieves have been here last night, and they have not
left a single sausage. Oh! if you had only got up when I asked you to!'"
the-war-of-the-wolf-and-the-fox,13,"Then Simon scratched his head and said, 'I can't understand it at all. I
certainly never believed the old dog was so quick at hearing.'

But Susan replied, 'I always told you our old dog was the best dog in
the world--but as usual you thought you knew so much better. Men are the
same all the world over.'

And the fox scored a point too, for he had carried away the sausages
himself!"
the-white-cat,1,"Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead. Now the King, though he felt that he was growing old, did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well, so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them."
the-white-cat,2,"So he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added:

""You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did. I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me. Now, as I think of retiring into the country, it seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very good company for me; so, without any regard for your ages, I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once."""
the-white-cat,3,"The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father's sudden fancy for a little dog, but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king, and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection, they accepted the commission with pleasure. They bade farewell to the King, who gave them presents of silver and precious stones, and appointed to meet them at the same hour, in the same place, after a year had passed, to see the little dogs they had brought for him."
the-white-cat,4,"Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always, to share whatever good fortune befell them, and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy; and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King together. Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear. He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it."
the-white-cat,5,"Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs-big and little, greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier, and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one, as, being alone, he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down. He took the first path he could find, and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined. This door was of gold covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest. The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; but as he was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay to look about any more, but came back to the golden door. There he saw a deer's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle."
the-white-cat,6,"""They must feel very secure against robbers,"" he said to himself. ""What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?"""
the-white-cat,7,"He pulled the deer's foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air, each holding a torch. He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang:

     ""The hands you see floating above
       Will swiftly your bidding obey;
     If your heart dreads not conquering Love,
       In this place you may fearlessly stay."""
the-white-cat,8,"The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered. After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped, and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner; at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince's wet, muddy clothes, and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all embroidered with gold and emeralds. He could not help admiring everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him, though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump."
the-white-cat,9,"When he was quite ready-and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer's foot-the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats. The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard. The Prince hastily stopped up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter."
the-white-cat,10,"""What funny thing shall I see next?"" he said to himself, and instantly the door opened, and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil. It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords, and a large party of cats followed, who brought in cages full of rats and mice."
the-white-cat,11,"The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine. She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince:

""King's son, you are welcome; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you.""

""Lady Cat,"" replied the Prince, ""I thank you for receiving me so kindly, but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly.""

""King's son,"" said the White Cat, ""I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them. But now,"" she added, ""let supper be served, and let the musicians be silent, as the Prince does not understand what they are saying."""
the-white-cat,12,"So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice. The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world."
the-white-cat,13,"After supper they went into another room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with tapestry worked with butterflies' wings of every color; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons. The Prince went to bed in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume. When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him."
the-white-cat,14,"The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! And so the days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone. The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even know what country he belonged to; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back, and one day she said to him:

""Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?"""
the-white-cat,15,"Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory, and cried:

""What can have made me forget such an important thing? My whole fortune depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?"" And he began to be very vexed. But the White Cat said to him: ""King's son, do not trouble yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. You can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours.""

""I thank you, beautiful Cat,"" said the Prince; ""but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?""

""See here,"" answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; ""there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!""

""Oh! White Cat dear,"" said the Prince, ""how unkind you are to laugh at me now!""

""Only listen,"" she said, holding the acorn to his ear.

And inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: ""Bow-wow!"""
the-white-cat,16,"The Prince was delighted, for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must be very small indeed. He wanted to take it out and look at it, but the White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the King, in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey. He thanked her a thousand times, and said good-by quite sadly when the time came for him to set out."
the-white-cat,17,"""The days have passed so quickly with you,"" he said, ""I only wish I could take you with me now."""
the-white-cat,18,But the White Cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer.
the-white-cat,19,"After all the Prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter."
the-white-cat,20,"The Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the King. Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature."
the-white-cat,21,"Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. Every door of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat. She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more."
the-white-cat,22,"""How could I hope that you would come back to me King's son?"" she said. And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded. The White Cat looked serious, and said she must think what was to be done, but that, luckily, there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well, and if anybody could manage it they could, and she would set them the task herself."
the-white-cat,23,"And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements-indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said:

""King's son, do not ask me; guess what you please. I may not tell you anything."""
the-white-cat,24,"The Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well.

""This time,"" she added, ""I can give you a suitable escort""; and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices. It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four abreast; their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with diamonds. A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses, and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards surrounded the procession. ""Go!"" said the White Cat, ""and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve. Take this walnut, but do not open it until you are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for.""

""Lovely Blanchette,"" said the Prince, ""how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me? Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always.""

""King's son,"" she replied, ""it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but to catch mice; but you must not stay."""
the-white-cat,25,"So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King's palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success. And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. The Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick, when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut. He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone. Everybody was looking on, and the King was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding the piece of muslin in a nutshell."
the-white-cat,26,"However, the Prince cracked the cherry-stone, but everyone laughed when he saw it contained only its own kernel. He opened that and found a grain of wheat, and in that was a millet seed. Then he himself began to wonder, and muttered softly:

""White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?"""
the-white-cat,27,"In an instant he felt a cat's claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease! The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world."
the-white-cat,28,"Presently the King turned to his sons, and said, with a deep sigh:

""Nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your willingness to gratify my wishes. Go then once more, and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my successor must certainly be married."" The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come. This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers, and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air. Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him. ""Well, King's son,"" she said, ""here you are once more, without a crown."" ""Madam,"" said he, ""thanks to your generosity I have earned one twice over; but the fact is that my father is so loth to part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it."""
the-white-cat,29,"""Never mind,"" she answered, ""it's just as well to try and deserve it. As you must take back a lovely princess with you next time I will be on the look-out for one for you. In the meantime let us enjoy ourselves; to-night I have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on purpose to amuse you."" So this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones. Sometimes the Prince could not help asking the White Cat how it was she could talk."
the-white-cat,30,"""Perhaps you are a fairy,"" he said. ""Or has some enchanter changed you into a cat?"""
the-white-cat,31,"But she only gave him answers that told him nothing. Days go by so quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the Prince would never have thought of its being time to go back, when one evening as they sat together the White Cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she told him."
the-white-cat,32,"""Take this sword,"" she said, ""and cut off my head!""

""I!"" cried the Prince, ""I cut off your head! Blanchette darling, how could I do it?""

""I entreat you to do as I tell you, King's son,"" she replied."
the-white-cat,33,"The tears came into the Prince's eyes as he begged her to ask him anything but that-to set him any task she pleased as a proof of his devotion, but to spare him the grief of killing his dear Pussy. But nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white head. But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat's skin! They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape. She received them graciously, but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the Prince, to whom she said:

""You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat. My father reigned over six kingdoms. The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants. On the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies. Nobody had ever been into it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else."
the-white-cat,34,"She began to wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of the garden. On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels, she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead. Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was determined that have it she would. So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; but though the wall did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top."
the-white-cat,35,"The Queen was in despair, but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were, and went to bed herself, feeling quite ill, she was so disappointed. In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her:

'I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition-that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own.'

'Ah! my dear madam,' cried the Queen, 'is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit? I will give you my kingdoms willingly.'

'No,' replied the old fairy, 'we will have nothing but your little daughter. She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her again until she is married.'

'Though it is a hard condition,' said the Queen, 'I consent, for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit, and so I should lose my little daughter either way.'"
the-white-cat,36,"""So the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince,"" said the White Cat, ""when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in. 'Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?' said the old fairy, 'or shall I call it to come to you?'

'I beg you to let me see it come when it is called,' cried the Queen; 'that will be something quite new.' The old fairy whistled twice, then she cried:

'Apricots, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, pears, melons, grapes, apples, oranges, lemons, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, come!'

And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them. You see they grew upon fairy trees."
the-white-cat,37,"The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away, and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry. Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and asked what was the matter. At first the Queen was afraid to tell him, but when, as soon as they reached the palace, five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me, she was obliged to confess what she had promised."
the-white-cat,38,"The King was very angry, and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country; and at last, after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies. This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. My cradle was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me. There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who could both talk; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon."
the-white-cat,39,"One day, however, as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince, who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison, and who was standing and looking up at me. When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference. You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell. But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower. The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; but, alas! just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in."
the-white-cat,40,"Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon. As for me, the fairies, furious at having their plans defeated, for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs, and I utterly refused, changed me into a white cat. When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father's court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands.

As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.

""And you have won it, lovely Princess,"" interrupted the Prince.

""You are indeed wonderfully like him,"" resumed the Princess-""in voice, in features, and everything; and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end.""

""And mine too,"" cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, ""if you will consent to marry me.""

""I love you already better than anyone in the world,"" she said; ""but now it is time to go back to your father, and we shall hear what he says about it."""
the-white-cat,41,"So the Prince gave her his hand and led her out, and they mounted the chariot together; it was even more splendid than before, and so was the whole company. Even the horses' shoes were of rubies with diamond nails, and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen."
the-white-cat,42,"As the Princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful, you may imagine what a delightful journey the Prince found it, for everything the Princess said seemed to him quite charming."
the-white-cat,43,"When they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet, the Princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards; it was hewn out of one splendid crystal, and had silken curtains, which she drew round her that she might not be seen."
the-white-cat,44,"The Prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace, each with a lovely princess, and they came to meet him, asking if he had also found a wife. He said that he had found something much rarer-a white cat! At which they laughed very much, and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace. And then they set out together for the town. Each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; the horses were decked with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold. After them came the youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity. When the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the King."
the-white-cat,45,"""Are the ladies beautiful?"" he asked anxiously.

And when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed.

However, he received them graciously, but found it impossible to choose between them.

Then turning to his youngest son he said:

""Have you come back alone, after all?""

""Your Majesty,"" replied the Prince, ""will find in that crystal chair a little white cat, which has such soft paws, and mews so prettily, that I am sure you will be charmed with it."""
the-white-cat,46,"The King smiled, and went to draw back the curtains himself, but at a touch from the Princess the crystal shivered into a thousand splinters, and there she stood in all her beauty; her fair hair floated over her shoulders and was crowned with flowers, and her softly falling robe was of the purest white. She saluted the King gracefully, while a murmur of admiration rose from all around."
the-white-cat,47,"""Sire,"" she said, ""I am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill so worthily. I have already six kingdoms, permit me to bestow one upon you, and upon each of your sons. I ask nothing but your friendship, and your consent to my marriage with your youngest son; we shall still have three kingdoms left for ourselves."""
the-white-cat,48,"The King and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and astonishment, and the marriage of the three Princes was celebrated at once. The festivities lasted several months, and then each king and queen departed to their own kingdom and lived happily ever after.(1)"
the-winter-spirit-and-his-visitor,1,"An old man was sitting alone in his lodge by the side of a frozen
stream. It was the close of winter, and his fire was almost out. He
appeared very old and very desolate. His locks were white with age, and
he trembled in every joint. Day after day passed in solitude, and he
heard nothing but the sounds of the tempest, sweeping before it the
new-fallen snow.

One day as his fire was just dying, a handsome young man approached and
entered his dwelling. His cheeks were red with the blood of youth; his
eyes sparkled with life, and a smile played upon his lips. He walked
with a light and quick step. His forehead was bound with a wreath of
sweet grass, in place of the warrior's frontlet, and he carried a bunch
of flowers in his hand.

""Ah! my son,"" said the old man, ""I am happy to see you. Come in. Come,
tell me of your adventures, and what strange lands you have been to
see. Let us pass the night together. I will tell you of my prowess and
exploits, and what I can perform. You shall do the same, and we will
amuse ourselves."""
the-winter-spirit-and-his-visitor,2,"He then drew from his sack a curiously-wrought antique pipe, and having
filled it with tobacco, rendered mild by an admixture of certain dried
leaves, he handed it to his guest. When this ceremony was attended to,
they began to speak.

""I blow my breath,"" said the old man, ""and the streams stand still. The
water becomes stiff and hard as clear stone.""

""I breathe,"" said the young man, ""and flowers spring up all over the
plains.""

""I shake my locks,"" retorted the old man, ""and snow covers the land. The
leaves fall from the trees at my command, and my breath blows them away.
The birds rise from the water and fly to a distant land. The animals
hide themselves from the glance of my eye, and the very ground where I
walk becomes as hard as flint.""

""I shake my ringlets,"" rejoined the young man, ""and warm showers of soft
rain fall upon the earth. The plants lift up their heads out of the
ground like the eyes of children glistening with delight. My voice
recalls the birds. The warmth of my breath unlocks the streams. Music
fills the groves wherever I walk, and all nature welcomes my approach."""
the-winter-spirit-and-his-visitor,3,"At length the sun begun to rise. A gentle warmth came over the place.
The tongue of the old man became silent. The robin and the blue-bird
began to sing on the top of the lodge. The stream began to murmur by the
door, and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the
vernal breeze.

Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his
entertainer. When he looked upon him he had the visage of Peboan, the
icy old Winter-Spirit. Streams began to flow from his eyes. As the sun
increased he grew less and less in stature, and presently he had melted
completely away. Nothing remained on the place of his lodge-fire but the
mis-kodeed, a small white flower with a pink border, which the young
visitor, Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring, placed in the wreath upon his
brow, as his first trophy in the North."
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,1,"THERE was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of
them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the
wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her.

""Dear children,"" said she, ""I am going out into the wood; and while I am
gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get
inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often
disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and
black paws.""

""Dear mother,"" answered the kids, ""you need not be afraid, we will take
good care of ourselves."" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on
her way with an easy mind."
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,2,"It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and
crying out,

""Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has
brought each of you something.""

But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice.

""We will not open the door,"" cried they; ""you are not our mother, she
has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be
the wolf."""
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,3,"Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate
it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the
house-door, and cried,

""Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought
each of you something.""

But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids
seeing this, cried out,

""We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you
must be the wolf."""
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,4,"The wolf then ran to a baker.

""Baker,"" said he, ""I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over
the place.""

And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller.

""Miller,"" said he, ""strew me some white meal over my paws."" But the
miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one.

""If you don't do it,"" cried the wolf, ""I'll eat you up!""

And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows
what men are."
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,5,"And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. ""Open,
children!"" cried he. ""Your dear mother has come home, and brought you
each something from the wood.""

""First show us your paws,"" said the kids, ""so that we may know if you
are really our mother or not.""

And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they
were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door; and when he was
inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to
hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed,
the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the
cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other
he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case.
And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the
green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep."
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,6,"Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a
sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and
stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the
bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called
to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name
of the youngest.

""Here I am, mother,"" a little voice cried, ""here, in the clock-case."""
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,7,"And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten
all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear
children. At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the
youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they
saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook.
The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how
something inside his body was moving and struggling."
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,8,"""Dear me!"" thought she, ""can it be that my poor children that he
devoured for his evening meal are still alive?"" And she sent the little
kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then
she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than
out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then
one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well,
for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How
delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped
about like tailors at a wedding.

""Now fetch some good hard stones,"" said the mother, ""and we will fill
his body with them, as he lies asleep."""
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,9,"And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the
mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.

When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him
feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they
struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:

    ""What is this I feel inside me
    Knocking hard against my bones?
    How should such a thing betide me!
    They were kids, and now they're stones."""
the-wolf-and-the-seven-little-goats,10,"So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones
weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And
when the seven little kids saw it they came up running.

""The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!"" they cried, and taking hands, they
danced with their mother all about the place."
thomas-the-rhymer,1,"Of all the young gallants in Scotland in the thirteenth century, there
was none more gracious and debonair than Thomas Learmont, Laird of the
Castle of Ercildoune, in Berwickshire.

He loved books, poetry, and music, which were uncommon tastes in those
days; and, above all, he loved to study nature, and to watch the habits
of the beasts and birds that made their abode in the fields and woods
round about his home.

Now it chanced that, one sunny May morning, Thomas left his Tower of
Ercildoune, and went wandering into the woods that lay about the Huntly
Burn, a little stream that came rushing down from the slopes of the
Eildon Hills. It was a lovely morning--fresh, and bright, and warm, and
everything was so beautiful that it looked as Paradise might look."
thomas-the-rhymer,2,"The tender leaves were bursting out of their sheaths, and covering all
the trees with a fresh soft mantle of green; and amongst the carpet of
moss under the young man's feet, yellow primroses and starry anemones
were turning up their faces to the morning sky.

The little birds were singing like to burst their throats, and hundreds
of insects were flying backwards and forwards in the sunshine; while
down by the burnside the bright-eyed water-rats were poking their noses
out of their holes, as if they knew that summer had come, and wanted to
have a share in all that was going on.

Thomas felt so happy with the gladness of it all, that he threw himself
down at the root of a tree, to watch the living things around him."
thomas-the-rhymer,3,"As he was lying there, he heard the trampling of a horse's hooves, as it
forced its way through the bushes; and, looking up, he saw the most
beautiful lady that he had ever seen coming riding towards him on a grey
palfrey.

She wore a hunting dress of glistening silk, the colour of the fresh
spring grass; and from her shoulders hung a velvet mantle, which matched
the riding-skirt exactly. Her yellow hair, like rippling gold, hung
loosely round her shoulders, and on her head sparkled a diadem of
precious stones, which flashed like fire in the sunlight.

Her saddle was of pure ivory, and her saddle-cloth of blood-red satin,
while her saddle girths were of corded silk and her stirrups of cut
crystal. Her horse's reins were of beaten gold, all hung with little
silver bells, so that, as she rode along, she made a sound like fairy
music."
thomas-the-rhymer,4,"Apparently she was bent on the chase, for she carried a hunting-horn and
a sheaf of arrows; and she led seven greyhounds along in a leash, while
as many scenting hounds ran loose at her horse's side.

As she rode down the glen, she lilted a bit of an old Scotch song; and
she carried herself with such a queenly air, and her dress was so
magnificent, that Thomas was like to kneel by the side of the path and
worship her, for he thought that it must be the Blessed Virgin herself.

But when the rider came to where he was, and understood his thoughts,
she shook her head sadly."
thomas-the-rhymer,5,"""I am not that Blessed Lady, as thou thinkest,"" she said. ""Men call me
Queen, but it is of a far other country; for I am the Queen of
Fairy-land, and not the Queen of Heaven.""

And certainly it seemed as if what she said were true; for, from that
moment, it was as if a spell were cast over Thomas, making him forget
prudence, and caution, and common-sense itself.

For he knew that it was dangerous for mortals to meddle with Fairies,
yet he was so entranced with the Lady's beauty that he begged her to
give him a kiss. This was just what she wanted, for she knew that if she
once kissed him she had him in her power."
thomas-the-rhymer,6,"And, to the young man's horror, as soon as their lips had met, an awful
change came over her. For her beautiful mantle and riding-skirt of silk
seemed to fade away, leaving her clad in a long grey garment, which was
just the colour of ashes. Her beauty seemed to fade away also, and she
grew old and wan; and, worst of all, half of her abundant yellow hair
went grey before his very eyes. She saw the poor man's astonishment and
terror, and she burst into a mocking laugh.

""I am not so fair to look on now as I was at first,"" she said, ""but that
matters little, for thou hast sold thyself, Thomas, to be my servant for
seven long years. For whoso kisseth the Fairy Queen must e'en go with
her to Fairy-land, and serve her there till that time is past.""

When he heard these words poor Thomas fell on his knees and begged for
mercy. But mercy he could not obtain. The Elfin Queen only laughed in
his face, and brought her dapple-grey palfrey close up to where he was
standing."
thomas-the-rhymer,7,"""No, no,"" she said, in answer to his entreaties. ""Thou didst ask the
kiss, and now thou must pay the price. So dally no longer, but mount
behind me, for it is full time that I was gone.""

So Thomas, with many a sigh and groan of terror, mounted behind her; and
as soon as he had done so, she shook her bridle rein, and the grey steed
galloped off.

On and on they went, going swifter than the wind; till they left the
land of the living behind, and came to the edge of a great desert, which
stretched before them, dry, and bare, and desolate, to the edge of the
far horizon.

At least, so it seemed to the weary eyes of Thomas of Ercildoune, and
he wondered if he and his strange companion had to cross this desert;
and, if so, if there were any chance of reaching the other side of it
alive."
thomas-the-rhymer,8,"But the Fairy Queen suddenly tightened her rein, and the grey palfrey
stopped short in its wild career.

""Now must thou descend to earth, Thomas,"" said the Lady, glancing over
her shoulder at her unhappy captive, ""and lout down, and lay thy head on
my knee, and I will show thee hidden things, which cannot be seen by
mortal eyes.""

So Thomas dismounted, and louted down, and rested his head on the Fairy
Queen's knee; and lo, as he looked once more over the desert, everything
seemed changed. For he saw three roads leading across it now, which he
had not noticed before, and each of these three roads was different.

One of them was broad, and level, and even, and it ran straight on
across the sand, so that no one who was travelling by it could possibly
lose his way."
thomas-the-rhymer,9,"And the second road was as different from the first as it well could be.
It was narrow, and winding, and long; and there was a thorn hedge on one
side of it, and a briar hedge on the other; and those hedges grew so
high, and their branches were so wild and tangled, that those who were
travelling along that road would have some difficulty in persevering on
their journey at all.

And the third road was unlike any of the others. It was a bonnie,
bonnie road, winding up a hillside among brackens, and heather, and
golden-yellow whins, and it looked as if it would be pleasant
travelling, to pass that way.

""Now,"" said the Fairy Queen, ""and thou wilt, I shall tell thee where
these three roads lead to. The first road, as thou seest, is broad, and
even, and easy, and there be many that choose it to travel on. But
though it be a good road, it leadeth to a bad end, and the folk that
choose it repent their choice for ever."""
thomas-the-rhymer,10,"""And as for the narrow road, all hampered and hindered by the thorns and
the briars, there be few that be troubled to ask where that leadeth to.
But did they ask, perchance more of them might be stirred up to set out
along it. For that is the Road of Righteousness; and, although it be
hard and irksome, yet it endeth in a glorious City, which is called the
City of the Great King.""

""And the third road--the bonnie road--that runs up the brae among the
ferns, and leadeth no mortal kens whither, but I ken where it leadeth,
Thomas--for it leadeth unto fair Elf-land; and that road take we.""

""And, mark'ee, Thomas, if ever thou hopest to see thine own Tower of
Ercildoune again, take care of thy tongue when we reach our journey's
end, and speak no single word to anyone save me--for the mortal who
openeth his lips rashly in Fairy-land must bide there for ever."""
thomas-the-rhymer,11,"Then she bade him mount her palfrey again, and they rode on. The ferny
road was not so bonnie all the way as it had been at first, however. For
they had not ridden along it very far before it led them into a narrow
ravine, which seemed to go right down under the earth, where there was
no ray of light to guide them, and where the air was dank and heavy.
There was a sound of rushing water everywhere, and at last the grey
palfrey plunged right into it; and it crept up, cold and chill, first
over Thomas's feet, and then over his knees.

His courage had been slowly ebbing ever since he had been parted from
the daylight, but now he gave himself up for lost; for it seemed to him
certain that his strange companion and he would never come safe to their
journey's end.

He fell forward in a kind of swoon; and, if it had not been that he had
tight hold of the Fairy's ash-grey gown, I warrant he had fallen from
his seat, and had been drowned.

But all things, be they good or bad, pass in time, and at last the
darkness began to lighten, and the light grew stronger, until they were
back in broad sunshine."
thomas-the-rhymer,12,"Then Thomas took courage, and looked up; and lo, they were riding
through a beautiful orchard, where apples and pears, dates and figs and
wine-berries grew in great abundance. And his tongue was so parched and
dry, and he felt so faint, that he longed for some of the fruit to
restore him.

He stretched out his hand to pluck some of it; but his companion turned
in her saddle and forbade him.

""There is nothing safe for thee to eat here,"" she said, ""save an apple,
which I will give thee presently. If thou touch aught else thou art
bound to remain in Fairy-land for ever.""

So poor Thomas had to restrain himself as best he could; and they rode
slowly on, until they came to a tiny tree all covered with red apples.
The Fairy Queen bent down and plucked one, and handed it to her
companion."
thomas-the-rhymer,13,"""This I can give thee,"" she said, ""and I do it gladly, for these apples
are the Apples of Truth; and whoso eateth them gaineth this reward, that
his lips will never more be able to frame a lie.""

Thomas took the apple, and ate it; and for evermore the Grace of Truth
rested on his lips; and that is why, in after years, men called him
""True Thomas.""

They had only a little way to go after this, before they came in sight
of a magnificent Castle standing on a hillside.

""Yonder is my abode,"" said the Queen, pointing to it proudly. ""There
dwelleth my Lord and all the Nobles of his court; and, as my Lord hath
an uncertain temper and shows no liking for any strange gallant whom he
sees in my company, I pray thee, both for thy sake and mine, to utter no
word to anyone who speaketh to thee; and, if anyone should ask me who
and what thou art, I will tell them that thou art dumb. So wilt thou
pass unnoticed in the crowd."""
thomas-the-rhymer,14,"With these words the Lady raised her hunting-horn, and blew a loud and
piercing blast; and, as she did so, a marvellous change came over her
again; for her ugly ash-covered gown dropped off her, and the grey in
her hair vanished, and she appeared once more in her green riding-skirt
and mantle, and her face grew young and fair.

And a wonderful change passed over Thomas also; for, as he chanced to
glance downwards, he found that his rough country clothes had been
transformed into a suit of fine brown cloth, and that on his feet he
wore satin shoon.

Immediately the sound of the horn rang out, the doors of the Castle flew
open, and the King hurried out to meet the Queen, accompanied by such a
number of Knights and Ladies, Minstrels and Page-boys, that Thomas, who
had slid from his palfrey, had no difficulty in obeying her wishes and
passing into the Castle unobserved.

Everyone seemed very glad to see the Queen back again, and they crowded
into the Great Hall in her train, and she spoke to them all graciously,
and allowed them to kiss her hand. Then she passed, with her husband, to
a dais at the far end of the huge apartment, where two thrones stood, on
which the Royal pair seated themselves to watch the revels which now
began."
thomas-the-rhymer,15,"Poor Thomas, meanwhile, stood far away at the other end of the Hall,
feeling very lonely, yet fascinated by the extraordinary scene on which
he was gazing.

For, although all the fine Ladies, and Courtiers, and Knights were
dancing in one part of the Hall, there were huntsmen coming and going in
another part, carrying in great antlered deer, which apparently they had
killed in the chase, and throwing them down in heaps on the floor. And
there were rows of cooks standing beside the dead animals, cutting them
up into joints, and bearing away the joints to be cooked.

Altogether it was such a strange, fantastic scene that Thomas took no
heed of how the time flew, but stood and gazed, and gazed, never
speaking a word to anybody. This went on for three long days, then the
Queen rose from her throne, and, stepping from the dais, crossed the
Hall to where he was standing."
thomas-the-rhymer,16,"""It is time to mount and ride, Thomas,"" she said, ""if thou wouldst ever
see the fair Castle of Ercildoune again.""

Thomas looked at her in amazement. ""Thou spokest of seven long years,
Lady,"" he exclaimed, ""and I have been here but three days.""

The Queen smiled. ""Time passeth quickly in Fairy-land, my friend,"" she
replied. ""Thou thinkest that thou hast been here but three days. It is
seven years since we two met. And now it is time for thee to go. I would
fain have had thy presence with me longer, but I dare not, for thine
own sake. For every seventh year an Evil Spirit cometh from the Regions
of Darkness, and carrieth back with him one of our followers, whomsoever
he chanceth to choose. And, as thou art a goodly fellow, I fear that he
might choose thee.""

""So, as I would be loth to let harm befall thee, I will take thee back
to thine own country this very night."""
thomas-the-rhymer,17,"Once more the grey palfrey was brought, and Thomas and the Queen mounted
it; and, as they had come, so they returned to the Eildon Tree near the
Huntly Burn.

Then the Queen bade Thomas farewell; and, as a parting gift, he asked
her to give him something that would let people know that he had really
been to Fairy-land.

""I have already given thee the Gift of Truth,"" she replied. ""I will now
give thee the Gifts of Prophecy and Poesie; so that thou wilt be able to
foretell the future, and also to write wondrous verses. And, besides
these unseen gifts, here is something that mortals can see with their
own eyes--a Harp that was fashioned in Fairy-land. Fare thee well, my
friend. Some day, perchance, I will return for thee again.""

With these words the Lady vanished, and Thomas was left alone, feeling a
little sorry, if the truth must be told, at parting with such a radiant
Being and coming back to the ordinary haunts of men."
thomas-the-rhymer,18,"After this he lived for many a long year in his Castle of Ercildoune,
and the fame of his poetry and of his prophecies spread all over the
country, so that people named him True Thomas, and Thomas the Rhymer.

I cannot write down for you all the prophecies which Thomas uttered, and
which most surely came to pass, but I will tell you one or two.

He foretold the Battle of Bannockburn in these words:

    ""The Burn of Breid
    Shall rin fou reid,""

which came to pass on that terrible day when the waters of the little
Bannockburn were reddened by the blood of the defeated English."
thomas-the-rhymer,19,"He also foretold the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, under
a Prince who was the son of a French Queen, and who yet bore the blood
of Bruce in his veins.

    ""A French Quen shall bearre the Sonne;
    Shall rule all Britainne to the sea,
    As neere as is the ninth degree,""

which thing came true in 1603, when King James, son of Mary, Queen of
Scots, became Monarch of both countries."
thomas-the-rhymer,20,"Fourteen long years went by, and people were beginning to forget that
Thomas the Rhymer had ever been in Fairy-land; but at last a day came
when Scotland was at war with England, and the Scottish army was
resting by the banks of the Tweed, not far from the Tower of
Ercildoune.

And the Master of the Tower determined to make a feast, and invite all
the Nobles and Barons who were leading the army to sup with him.

That feast was long remembered.

For the Laird of Ercildoune took care that everything was as magnificent
as it could possibly be; and when the meal was ended he rose in his
place, and, taking his Elfin Harp, he sang to his assembled guests song
after song of the days of long ago."
thomas-the-rhymer,21,"The guests listened breathlessly, for they felt that they would never
hear such wonderful music again. And so it fell out.

For that very night, after all the Nobles had gone back to their tents,
a soldier on guard saw, in the moonlight, a snow-white Hart and Hind
moving slowly down the road that ran past the camp.

There was something so unusual about the animals that he called to his
officer to come and look at them. And the officer called to his brother
officers, and soon there was quite a crowd softly following the dumb
creatures, who paced solemnly on, as if they were keeping time to music
unheard by mortal ears.

""There is something uncanny about this,"" said one soldier at last. ""Let
us send for Thomas of Ercildoune, perchance he may be able to tell us if
it be an omen or no.""

""Ay, send for Thomas of Ercildoune,"" cried every one at once. So a
little page was sent in haste to the old Tower to rouse the Rhymer from
his slumbers."
thomas-the-rhymer,22,"When he heard the boy's message, the Seer's face grew grave and wrapt.

""It is a summons,"" he said softly, ""a summons from the Queen of
Fairy-land. I have waited long for it, and it hath come at last.""

And when he went out, instead of joining the little company of waiting
men, he walked straight up to the snow-white Hart and Hind. As soon as
he reached them they paused for a moment as if to greet him. Then all
three moved slowly down a steep bank that sloped to the little river
Leader, and disappeared in its foaming waters, for the stream was in
full flood.

And, although a careful search was made, no trace of Thomas of
Ercildoune was found; and to this day the country folk believe that the
Hart and the Hind were messengers from the Elfin Queen, and that he went
back to Fairy-land with them."
three-lemons,1,"Once upon a time there were three brothers who had lost their parents,
and since the latter had left their sons nothing upon which to live,
they had to wander out into the world, and seek their fortune. The two
older brothers prepared for the journey as well as they were able; but
the youngest, whom they called ""Mike by the Stove,"" because he was
always sitting behind the stove whittling, they did not want to take
with them. So they set out at early dawn; yet for all their hurrying
Mike by the Stove reached the king's court as soon as they did. When
they got there, they asked to be taken into the king's service. Well,
said the king, he really had no work for them to do; but since they
were so poor, he would see that they were kept busy; there was always
something or other to do in such a big establishment: they could drive
nails into the wall, and when they were through, they could pull them
out again. And when that was done, they could carry wood and water into
the kitchen. Mike by the Stove was quickest at driving his nails into
the wall, and pulling them out again, and he had been quick, too, about
carrying his wood and water. Therefore his brothers grew jealous, and
said he had declared he could obtain the most beautiful princess in
twelve kingdoms for the king--for the king's wife had died and he was
a widower. When the king heard this, he told Mike by the Stove he had
better do as he had said, else he would have him brought to the block,
and his head chopped off."
three-lemons,2,"Mike by the Stove replied that he had neither said nor thought anything
of the kind; but that seeing the king was so severe, he would try it. So
he took a knapsack full of food and set out. But he had only pushed a
little way into the wood before he grew hungry, and thought he would
sample the provisions they had given him at the king's castle. When he
had sat down in all peace and comfort under a pine-tree by the side of
the road, an old woman came limping along, and asked him what he had in
his knapsack. ""Meat and bacon, granny,"" said the youth. ""If you are
hungry, come and share with me!"" She thanked him, satisfied her hunger,
and then telling him she would do him a favor in turn, limped off into
the wood. When Mike by the Stove had eaten his fill, he slung his
knapsack across his shoulder once more, and went his way; but he had
only gone a short distance before he found a whistle. That would be
fine, thought he, to have a whistle, and be able to whistle himself a
tune while he traveled, and before long he really succeeded in making
it sound."
three-lemons,3,"That very moment the wood was alive with dwarfs, all of them
asking with one voice: ""What are my lord's commands? What are my lord's
commands?"" Mike by the Stove said he did not know he was their lord;
but if he had any command to give, he would ask them to bring him the
fairest princess in twelve kingdoms. That would be easy enough, said the
dwarfs; they knew exactly who she was, and they could show him the way;
then he himself could go and fetch her, since the dwarfs were powerless
to touch her. They showed him the way, and he reached his goal quickly
and without trouble, for no one interfered with him. It was a troll's
castle, and in it were three beautiful princesses; but when Mike by the
Stove stepped in, they acted as though they had lost their wits, ran
around like frightened lambs, and finally turned into three lemons that
lay on the window-ledge. Mike by the Stove was in despair, and very
unhappy because he did not know what to do. But after he had reflected
a while, he took the three lemons, and put them in his pocket; because,
thought he, he might be glad he had done so should he grow thirsty
during his journey, for he had heard that lemons were sour."
three-lemons,4,"After he had traveled a way, he grew very warm and thirsty. There was no
water to be found, and he did not know how he was to refresh himself.
Then the lemons occurred to him, and he took one and bit into it. But in
it sat a princess, visible up to her arms, and cried: ""Water, water!""
If she could not have some water, said she, she must die. The youth ran
about everywhere like mad, looking for water; but there was no water
there, and none to be found, and when he returned she was dead.

After he had gone on again a while, he grew still more thirsty, and
since he found nothing with which to refresh himself, he took another
lemon and bit into it. And another princess looked out, up to her
shoulders, and she was even more beautiful than the first. She cried for
water, and said that if she could not have some water she must die on
the spot. Mike by the Stove ran about and looked under stones and moss;
but he found no water, so this princess also died."
three-lemons,5,"Mike by the Stove thought that things were going from bad to worse, and
this was the truth, since the further he went the warmer it grew. The
part of the country in which he was traveling was so parched and dried
that not a drop of water was to be found, and he was half-dead with
thirst. For a long time he hesitated before biting into the last lemon;
but at last there was nothing else left to do. When he had bitten
into it, a princess looked out: she was the most beautiful in twelve
kingdoms, and she cried that if she could have no water, she must die on
the spot. Mike by the Stove ran about and looked for water, and this
time he met the king's miller, who showed him the way to the mill-pond.
When he had come with her to the mill-pond, and had given her water, she
came completely out of the lemon. But she had nothing to wear, and Mike
by the Stove had to give her his smock. She put it on, and hid in a
tree; while he was to go to the castle and bring her clothes, and tell
the king he had found her, and how it had all happened.

Meanwhile the cook had come down to the pond to fetch water. When she
saw the lovely face that was reflected in the pond, she thought it was
her own, and was so pleased that she began to dance and jump around,
because she had grown so beautiful."
three-lemons,6,"""Let the devil fetch the water, I'm far too handsome to bother with it!""
said she, and threw away the water-pail. And then she suddenly noticed
that the face in the water was that of the princess who sat in the tree.
This made her so angry that she pulled her down from the tree, and threw
her into the pond. Then she herself put on Mike by the Stove's smock,
and climbed into the tree. When the king arrived, and saw the swart,
homely kitchen-maid, he grew red and white in turn; but when he heard
the people say she was the greatest beauty in twelve kingdoms, he had to
believe, willy-nilly, that there was something in it, and he did not
want to be unjust to Mike by the Stove, who had taken so much trouble to
find her. She might grow more beautiful in time, thought he, if she were
adorned with jewels, and dressed in fine clothes, and so he took her
home with him. Then they sent for wig-makers and seamstresses, and she
was adorned and dressed like a princess; but for all their washing and
bedizening, she remained swart and homely."
three-lemons,7,"After a while, when the
kitchen-maid had to go to the pond to fetch water, she caught a great
silver fish in her pail. She carried it up and showed it to the king,
who thought it was a beauty; but the homely princess declared it to be
the work of witches, and that they were to burn it, for she had noticed
at once what it was. So the following morning the fish was burned, and
they found a lump of silver in the ashes. Then the cook went up and
told the king, and he thought it very strange; but the princess said it
was witchcraft pure and simple, and that they were to bury the silver
under the manure-pile. The king did not want to, but she gave him no
peace until he consented, and finally said they were to do so. But on
the following day a beautiful linden-tree stood where they had buried
the lump of silver, and the leaves of the linden-tree glistened like
silver, too. When they told the king he thought it remarkable; but the
princess said it was no more nor less than witchcraft, and that the
linden-tree must be cut down."
three-lemons,8,"This the king did not wish done at all;
but the princess tormented him so that finally he yielded in this as
well. When the maids went out and brought wood for the fire from the
linden-tree, it was pure silver. ""We need not tell the king and the
princess anything about it,"" said one of them, ""for they would only burn
it up and melt it down. Let us keep it in the wardrobe instead. It might
be very useful to us some day, if some one comes along, and we want to
marry."" They were all of the same mind, but when they had carried the
wood a while, it grew terribly heavy. And when they looked to see why
this was, the sticks of wood had turned into a little child, and before
long she had become the most beautiful princess imaginable."
three-lemons,9,"The maids
saw that there was some hocus-pocus about it, gave her clothes, ran off
to fetch the youth who had been sent to find the most beautiful princess
in twelve kingdoms, and told him their story. And when Mike by the
Stove arrived, the princess explained to him how everything had
happened, that the cook had thrown her into the pond, and that she had
been the silver fish, the lump of silver, and the linden-tree, and the
sticks of wood, and that she was the true princess. It was hard to get
at the king, for the swart, homely cook was with him early and late; but
at last they decided to tell him that a declaration of war had come
from a neighboring monarch, and so they got him out. When he saw the
beautiful princess, he fell so deeply in love with her that he wanted to
marry her out of hand, and when he heard how badly the swart, homely
cook had treated her, the latter was promptly punished. Then they held
a wedding that was heard of and talked about in twelve kingdoms."
three-treasures-of-giants,1,"Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife who had three sons; the eldest was called Martin, the second Michael, while the third was named Jack.

One evening they were all seated round the table, eating their supper of bread and milk."
three-treasures-of-giants,2,"'Martin,' said the old man suddenly, 'I feel that I cannot live much longer. You, as the eldest, will inherit this hut; but, if you value my blessing, be good to your mother and brothers.'

'Certainly, father; how can you suppose I should do them wrong?' replied Martin indignantly, helping himself to all the best bits in the dish as he spoke. The old man saw nothing, but Michael looked on in surprise, and Jack was so astonished that he quite forgot to eat his own supper."
three-treasures-of-giants,3,"A little while after, the father fell ill, and sent for his sons, who were out hunting, to bid him farewell. After giving good advice to the two eldest, he turned to Jack.

'My boy,' he said, 'you have not got quite as much sense as other people, but if Heaven has deprived you of some of your wits, it was given you a kind heart. Always listen to what it says, and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers, as well as you are able!' So saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died.

The cries of grief uttered by Martin and Michael sounded through the house, but Jack remained by the bedside of his father, still and silent, as if he were dead also. At length he got up, and going into the garden, hid himself in some trees, and wept like a child, while his two brothers made ready for the funeral."
three-treasures-of-giants,4,"No sooner was the old man buried than Martin and Michael agreed that they would go into the world together to seek their fortunes, while Jack stayed at home with their mother. Jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire, but the mother, who was very old herself, declared that there was no work for him to do, and that he must seek it with his brothers.

So, one fine morning, all three set out; Martin and Michael carried two great bags full of food, but Jack carried nothing. This made his brothers very angry, for the day was hot and the bags were heavy, and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat. Jack was as hungry as they were, but he knew that it was no use asking for anything; and he threw himself under another tree, and wept bitterly."
three-treasures-of-giants,5,"'Another time perhaps you won't be so lazy, and will bring food for yourself,' said Martin, but to his surprise Jack answered:

'You are a nice pair! You talk of seeking your fortunes so as not to be a burden on our mother, and you begin by carrying off all the food she has in the house!'

This reply was so unexpected that for some moments neither of the brothers made any answer. Then they offered their brother some of their food, and when he had finished eating they went their way once more."
three-treasures-of-giants,6,"Towards evening they reached a small hut, and knocking at the door, asked if they might spend the night there. The man, who was a wood-cutter, invited them him, and begged them to sit down to supper. Martin thanked him, but being very proud, explained that it was only shelter they wanted, as they had plenty of food with them; and he and Michael at once opened their bags and began to eat, while Jack hid himself in a corner. The wife, on seeing this, took pity on him, and called him to come and share their supper, which he gladly did, and very good he found it. At this, Martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse, for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying.

'He shan't have such a chance again,' thought he; and the next morning he insisted on plunging into a thick forest where they were likely to meet nobody."
three-treasures-of-giants,7,"For a long time they wandered hither and thither, for they had no path to guide them; but at last they came upon a wide clearing, in the midst of which stood a castle. Jack shouted with delight, but Martin, who was in a bad temper, said sharply:

'We must have taken a wrong turning! Let us go back.'

'Idiot!' replied Michael, who was hungry too, and, like many people when they are hungry, very cross also. 'We set out to travel through the world, and what does it matter if we go to the right or to the left?' And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely followed by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise."
three-treasures-of-giants,8,"The door of the castle stood open, and they entered a great hall, and looked about them. Not a creature was to be seen, and suddenly Martin-he did not know why-felt a little frightened. He would have left the castle at once, but stopped when Jack boldly walked up to a door in the wall and opened it. He could not for very shame be outdone by his younger brother, and passed behind him into another splendid hall, which was filled from floor to ceiling with great pieces of copper money.

The sight quite dazzled Martin and Michael, who emptied all the provisions that remained out of their bags, and heaped them up instead with handfuls of copper."
three-treasures-of-giants,9,"Scarcely had they done this when Jack threw open another door, and this time it led to a hall filled with silver. In an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down, so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor, and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead. They had hardly finished, when Jack opened yet a third door, and all three fell back in amazement, for this room as a mass of gold, so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it. However, they soon recovered from their surprise, and quickly emptied their bags of silver, and filled them with gold instead. When they would hold no more, Martin said:

'We had better hurry off now lest somebody else should come, and we might not know what to do'; and, followed by Michael, he hastily left the castle. Jack lingered behind for a few minutes to put pieces of gold, silver, and copper into his pocket, and to eat the food that his brothers had thrown down in the first room. Then he went after them, and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest. It was near sunset, and Martin began to feel hungry, so, when Jack arrived, he bade him return to the castle and bring the bread and cheese that they had left there."
three-treasures-of-giants,10,"'It is hardly worth doing that,' answered Jack; 'for I picked up the pieces and ate them myself.'

At this reply both brothers were beside themselves with anger, and fell upon the boy, beating him, and calling him names, till they were quite tired.

'Go where you like,' cried Martin with a final kick; 'but never come near us again.' And poor Jack ran weeping into the woods.

The next morning his brothers went home, and bought a beautiful house, where they lived with their mother like great lords."
three-treasures-of-giants,11,"Jack remained for some hours in hiding, thankful to be safe from his tormentors; but when no one came to trouble him, and his back did not ache so much, he began to think what he had better do. At length he made up his mind to go to the caste and take away as much money with him as would enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. This being decided, he sprang up, and set out along the path which led to the castle. As before, the door stood open, and he went on till he had reached the hall of gold, and there he took off his jacket and tied the sleeves together so that it might make a kind of bag. He then began to pour in the gold by handfuls, when, all at once, a noise like thunder shook the castle. This was followed by a voice, hoarse as that of a bull, which cried:

'I smell the smell of a man.' And two giants entered."
three-treasures-of-giants,12,"'So, little worm! it is you who steal our treasures!' exclaimed the biggest. 'Well, we have got you now, and we will cook you for supper!' But here the other giant drew him aside, and for a moment or two they whispered together. At length the first giant spoke:

'To please my friend I will spare your life on condition that, for the future, you shall guard our treasures. If you are hungry take this little table and rap on it, saying, as you do so: ""The dinner of an emperor!"" and you will get as much food as you want.'

With a light heart Jack promised all that was asked of him, and for some days enjoyed himself mightily. He had everything he could wish for, and did nothing from morning till night; but by-and-by he began to get very tired of it all."
three-treasures-of-giants,13,"'Let the giants guard their treasures themselves,' he said to himself at last; 'I am going away. But I will leave all the gold and silver behind me, and will take nought but you, my good little table.'

So, tucking the table under his arm, he started off for the forest, but he did not linger there long, and soon found himself in the fields on the other side. There he saw an old man, who begged Jack to give him something to eat.

'You could not have asked a better person,' answered Jack cheerfully. And signing to him to sit down with him under a tree, he set the table in front of them, and struck it three times, crying:

'The dinner of an emperor!' He had hardly uttered the words when fish and meat of all kinds appeared on it!"
three-treasures-of-giants,14,"'That is a clever trick of yours,' said the old man, when he had eaten as much as he wanted. 'Give it to me in exchange for a treasure I have which is still better. Do you see this cornet? Well, you have only to tell it that you wish for an army, and you will have as many soldiers as you require.'

Now, since he had been left to himself, Jack had grown ambitious, so, after a moment's hesitation, he took the cornet and gave the table in exchange. The old man bade him farewell, and set off down one path, while Jack chose another, and for a long time he was quite pleased with his new possession. Then, as he felt hungry, he wished for his table back again, as no house was in sight, and he wanted some supper badly. All at once he remembered his cornet, and a wicked thought entered his mind."
three-treasures-of-giants,15,"'Two hundred hussars, forward!' cried he. And the neighing of horses and the clanking of swords were heard close at hand. The officer who rode at their head approached Jack, and politely inquired what he wished them to do.

'A mile or two along that road,' answered Jack, 'you will find an old man carrying a table. Take the table from him and bring it to me.'

The officer saluted and went back to his men, who started at a gallop to do Jack's bidding.

In ten minutes they had returned, bearing the table with them.

'That is all, thank you,' said Jack; and the soldiers disappeared inside the cornet."
three-treasures-of-giants,16,"Oh, what a good supper Jack had that night, quite forgetting that he owed it to a mean trick. The next day he breakfasted early, and then walked on towards the nearest town. On the way thither he met another old man, who begged for something to eat.

'Certainly, you shall have something to eat,' replied Jack. And, placing the table on the ground he cried:

'The dinner of an emperor!' when all sorts of food dishes appeared. At first the old man ate quite greedily, and said nothing; but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said:

'That is a very clever trick of yours. Give the table to me and you shall have something still better.'

'I don't believe that there is anything better,' answered Jack.

'Yes, there is. Here is my bag; it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want.'"
three-treasures-of-giants,17,"Jack thought for a moment; then he replied: 'Very well, I will exchange with you.' And passing the table to the old man, he hung the bag over his arm.

Five minutes later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table.

Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place. Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip. In this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men, much respected in all the country round. When he heard that, he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter; but the only thing he got was hard words, and a command to beg elsewhere. At length, however, at their mother's entreaty, he was told that he might pass the night in the stable. Here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep, when he drew his bag from under his cloak, and desired that a castle might appear in that place; and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle, while the table furnished him with a good supper. In the morning, he caused it all to vanish, and when his brothers entered the stable they found him lying on the straw."
three-treasures-of-giants,18,"Jack remained here for many days, doing nothing, and-as far as anybody knew-eating nothing. This conduct puzzled his brothers greatly, and they put such constant questions to him, that at length he told them the secret of the table, and even gave a dinner to them, which far outdid any they had ever seen or heard of. But though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing, somehow or other the tale leaked out, and before long reached the ears of the king himself. That very evening his chamberlain arrived at Jack's dwelling, with a request from the king that he might borrow the table for three days.

'Very well,' answered Jack, 'you can take it back with you. But tell his majesty that if he does not return it at the end of the three days I will make war upon him.'

So the chamberlain carried away the table and took it straight to the king, telling him at the same time of Jack's threat, at which they both laughed till their sides ached."
three-treasures-of-giants,19,"Now the king was so delighted with the table, and the dinners it gave him, that when the three days were over he could not make up his mind to part with it. Instead, he sent for his carpenter, and bade him copy it exactly, and when it was done he told his chamberlain to return it to Jack with his best thanks. It happened to be dinner time, and Jack invited the chamberlain, who knew nothing of the trick, to stay and dine with him. The good man, who had eaten several excellent meals provided by the table in the last three days, accepted the invitation with pleasure, even though he was to dine in a stable, and sat down on the straw beside Jack.

'The dinner of an emperor!' cried Jack. But not even a morsel of cheese made its appearance.

'The dinner of an emperor!' shouted Jack in a voice of thunder. Then the truth dawned on him; and, crushing the table between his hands, he turned to the chamberlain, who, bewildered and half-frightened, was wondering how to get away."
three-treasures-of-giants,20,"'Tell your false king that to-morrow I will destroy his castle as easily as I have broken this table.'

The chamberlain hastened back to the palace, and gave the king Jack's message, at which he laughed more than before, and called all his courtiers to hear the story. But they were not quite so merry when they woke next morning and beheld ten thousand horsemen, and as many archers, surrounding the palace. The king saw it was useless to hold out, and he took the white flag of truce in one hand, and the real table in the other, and set out to look for Jack.

'I committed a crime,' said he; 'but I will do my best to make up for it. Here is your table, which I own with shame that I tried to steal, and you shall have besides, my daughter as your wife!'"
three-treasures-of-giants,21,"There was no need to delay the marriage when the table was able to furnish the most splendid banquet that ever was seen, and after everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted, Jack took his bag and commanded a castle filled with all sorts of treasures to arise in the park for himself and his bride.

At this proof of his power the king's heart died within him.

'Your magic is greater than mine,' he said; 'and you are young and strong, while I am old and tired. Take, therefore, the sceptre from my hand, and my crown from my head, and rule my people better than I have done.'"
three-treasures-of-giants,22,"So at last Jack's ambition was satisfied. He could not hope to be more than king, and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies. He never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him, though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle, and everything she could possibly wish for. In the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber, and in this chamber the table, the cornet, and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions, and not a week passed without a visit from king John to make sure they were safe. He reigned long and well, and died a very old man, beloved by his people."
thumbelina,1,"There was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny, little child, but she did not know where to get one from. So one day she went to an old Witch and said to her: 'I should so much like to have a tiny, little child; can you tell me where I can get one?'

'Oh, we have just got one ready!'said the Witch. 'Here is a barley-corn for you, but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field, or feeds the cocks and hens with, I can tell you. Put it in a flower-pot, and then you will see something happen.'

'Oh, thank you!'said the woman, and gave the Witch a shilling, for that was what it cost. Then she went home and planted the barley-corn; immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower, which looked like a tulip, but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud."
thumbelina,2,"'What a beautiful flower!'exclaimed the woman, and she kissed the red and yellow petals; but as she kissed them the flower burst open. It was a real tulip, such as one can see any day; but in the middle of the blossom, on the green velvety petals, sat a little girl, quite tiny, trim, and pretty. She was scarcely half a thumb in height; so they called her Thumbelina. An elegant polished walnut-shell served Thumbelina as a cradle, the blue petals of a violet were her mattress, and a rose-leaf her coverlid. There she lay at night, but in the day-time she used to play about on the table; here the woman had put a bowl, surrounded by a ring of flowers, with their stalks in water, in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal, and on this Thumbelina sat, and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other, rowing herself with two white horse-hairs for oars. It was such a pretty sight! She could sing, too, with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before."
thumbelina,3,"One night, when she was lying in her pretty little bed, an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window. She was very ugly, clumsy, and clammy; she hopped on to the table where Thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose-leaf.

'This would make a beautiful wife for my son,'said the toad, taking up the walnut-shell, with Thumbelina inside, and hopping with it through the window into the garden.

There flowed a great wide stream, with slippery and marshy banks; here the toad lived with her son. Ugh! how ugly and clammy he was, just like his mother! 'Croak, croak, croak!'was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut-shell."
thumbelina,4,"'Don't talk so load, or you'll wake her,'said the old toad. 'She might escape us even now; she is as light as a feather. We will put her at once on a broad water-lily leaf in the stream. That will be quite an island for her; she is so small and light. She can't run away from us there, whilst we are preparing the guest-chamber under the marsh where she shall live.'

Outside in the brook grew many water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which looked as if they were swimming about on the water.

The leaf farthest away was the largest, and to this the old toad swam with Thumbelina in her walnut-shell."
thumbelina,5,"The tiny Thumbelina woke up very early in the morning, and when she saw where she was she began to cry bitterly; for on every side of the great green leaf was water, and she could not get to the land.

The old toad was down under the marsh, decorating her room with rushes and yellow marigold leaves, to make it very grand for her new daughter-in-law; then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where Thumbelina lay. She wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before Thumbelina herself came there. The old toad bowed low in the water before her, and said: 'Here is my son; you shall marry him, and live in great magnificence down under the marsh.'"
thumbelina,6,"'Croak, croak, croak!'was all that the son could say. Then they took the neat little cradle and swam away with it; but Thumbelina sat alone on the great green leaf and wept, for she did not want to live with the clammy toad, or marry her ugly son. The little fishes swimming about under the water had seen the toad quite plainly, and heard what she had said; so they put up their heads to see the little girl. When they saw her, they thought her so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live. No; that must not happen. They assembled in the water round the green stalk which supported the leaf on which she was sitting, and nibbled the stem in two. Away floated the leaf down the stream, bearing Thumbelina far beyond the reach of the toad.

On she sailed past several towns, and the little birds sitting in the bushes saw her, and sang, 'What a pretty little girl!'The leaf floated farther and farther away; thus Thumbelina left her native land."
thumbelina,7,"A beautiful little white butterfly fluttered above her, and at last settled on the leaf. Thumbelina pleased him, and she, too, was delighted, for now the toads could not reach her, and it was so beautiful where she was travelling; the sun shone on the water and made it sparkle like the brightest silver. She took off her sash, and tied one end round the butterfly; the other end she fastened to the leaf, so that now it glided along with her faster than ever.

A great cockchafer came flying past; he caught sight of Thumbelina, and in a moment had put his arms round her slender waist, and had flown off with her to a tree. The green leaf floated away down the stream, and the butterfly with it, for he was fastened to the leaf and could not get loose from it. Oh, dear! how terrified poor little Thumbelina was when the cockchafer flew off with her to the tree! But she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly's account, as she had tied him fast, so that if he could not get away he must starve to death. But the cockchafer did not trouble himself about that; he sat down with her on a large green leaf, gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat, and told her that she was very pretty, although she wasn't in the least like a cockchafer. Later on, all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls; they examined Thumbelina closely, and remarked, 'Why, she has only two legs! How very miserable!'"
thumbelina,8,"'She has no feelers!'cried another.

'How ugly she is!'said all the lady chafers-and yet Thumbelina was really very pretty.

The cockchafer who had stolen her knew this very well; but when he heard all the ladies saying she was ugly, he began to think so too, and would not keep her; she might go wherever she liked. So he flew down from the tree with her and put her on a daisy. There she sat and wept, because she was so ugly that the cockchafer would have nothing to do with her; and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable, so soft and delicate, like the loveliest rose-leaf."
thumbelina,9,"The whole summer poor little Thumbelina lived alone in the great wood. She plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass, and hung it up under a clover-leaf, so that she was protected from the rain; she gathered honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew on the leaves every morning. Thus the summer and autumn passed, but then came winter-the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung so sweetly about her had flown away; the trees shed their leaves, the flowers died; the great clover-leaf under which she had lived curled up, and nothing remained of it but the withered stalk. She was terribly cold, for her clothes were ragged, and she herself was so small and thin. Poor little Thumbelina! she would surely be frozen to death. It began to snow, and every snow-flake that fell on her was to her as a whole shovelful thrown on one of us, for we are so big, and she was only an inch high. She wrapt herself round in a dead leaf, but it was torn in the middle and gave her no warmth; she was trembling with cold."
thumbelina,10,"Just outside the wood where she was now living lay a great corn-field. But the corn had been gone a long time; only the dry, bare stubble was left standing in the frozen ground. This made a forest for her to wander about in. All at once she came across the door of a field-mouse, who had a little hole under a corn-stalk. There the mouse lived warm and snug, with a store-room full of corn, a splendid kitchen and dining-room. Poor little Thumbelina went up to the door and begged for a little piece of barley, for she had not had anything to eat for the last two days."
thumbelina,11,"'Poor little creature!'said the field-mouse, for she was a kind-hearted old thing at the bottom. 'Come into my warm room and have some dinner with me.'

As Thumbelina pleased her, she said: 'As far as I am concerned you may spend the winter with me; but you must keep my room clean and tidy, and tell me stories, for I like that very much.'

And Thumbelina did all that the kind old field-mouse asked, and did it remarkably well too."
thumbelina,12,"'Now I am expecting a visitor,'said the field-mouse; 'my neighbour comes to call on me once a week. He is in better circumstances than I am, has great, big rooms, and wears a fine black-velvet coat. If you could only marry him, you would be well provided for. But he is blind. You must tell him all the prettiest stories you know.'

But Thumbelina did not trouble her head about him, for he was only a mole. He came and paid them a visit in his black-velvet coat.

'He is so rich and so accomplished,'the field-mouse told her.

'His house is twenty times larger than mine; he possesses great knowledge, but he cannot bear the sun and the beautiful flowers, and speaks slightingly of them, for he has never seen them.'"
thumbelina,13,"Thumbelina had to sing to him, so she sang 'Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home!'and other songs so prettily that the mole fell in love with her; but he did not say anything, he was a very cautious man. A short time before he had dug a long passage through the ground from his own house to that of his neighbour; in this he gave the field-mouse and Thumbelina permission to walk as often as they liked. But he begged them not to be afraid of the dead bird that lay in the passage: it was a real bird with beak and feathers, and must have died a little time ago, and now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel. The mole took a piece of rotten wood in his mouth, for that glows like fire in the dark, and went in front, lighting them through the long dark passage."
thumbelina,14,"When they came to the place where the dead bird lay, the mole put his broad nose against the ceiling and pushed a hole through, so that the daylight could shine down. In the middle of the path lay a dead swallow, his pretty wings pressed close to his sides, his claws and head drawn under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of cold. Thumbelina was very sorry, for she was very fond of all little birds; they had sung and twittered so beautifully to her all through the summer. But the mole kicked him with his bandy legs and said:

'Now he can't sing any more! It must be very miserable to be a little bird! I'm thankful that none of my little children are; birds always starve in winter.'

'Yes, you speak like a sensible man,'said the field-mouse. 'What has a bird, in spite of all his singing, in the winter-time? He must starve and freeze, and that must be very pleasant for him, I must say!'"
thumbelina,15,"Thumbelina did not say anything; but when the other two had passed on she bent down to the bird, brushed aside the feathers from his head, and kissed his closed eyes gently. 'Perhaps it was he that sang to me so prettily in the summer,'she thought. 'How much pleasure he did give me, dear little bird!'

The mole closed up the hole again which let in the light, and then escorted the ladies home. But Thumbelina could not sleep that night; so she got out of bed, and plaited a great big blanket of straw, and carried it off, and spread it over the dead bird, and piled upon it thistle-down as soft as cotton-wool, which she had found in the field-mouse's room, so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried.

'Farewell, pretty little bird!'she said. 'Farewell, and thank you for your beautiful songs in the summer, when the trees were green, and the sun shone down warmly on us!'Then she laid her head against the bird's heart. But the bird was not dead: he had been frozen, but now that she had warmed him, he was coming to life again."
thumbelina,16,"In autumn the swallows fly away to foreign lands; but there are some who are late in starting, and then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead, and the snow comes and covers them over.

Thumbelina trembled, she was so frightened; for the bird was very large in comparison with herself-only an inch high. But she took courage, piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow, fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head.

Next night she crept out again to him. There he was alive, but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at Thumbelina, who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern."
thumbelina,17,"'Thank you, pretty little child!'said the swallow to her. 'I am so beautifully warm! Soon I shall regain my strength, and then I shall be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine.'

'Oh!'she said, 'it is very cold outside; it is snowing and freezing! stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you!'

Then she brought him water in a petal, which he drank, after which he related to her how he had torn one of his wings on a bramble, so that he could not fly as fast as the other swallows, who had flown far away to warmer lands. So at last he had dropped down exhausted, and then he could remember no more. The whole winter he remained down there, and Thumbelina looked after him and nursed him tenderly. Neither the mole nor the field-mouse learnt anything of this, for they could not bear the poor swallow."
thumbelina,18,"When the spring came, and the sun warmed the earth again, the swallow said farewell to Thumbelina, who opened the hole in the roof for him which the mole had made. The sun shone brightly down upon her, and the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit upon his back. Thumbelina wanted very much to fly far away into the green wood, but she knew that the old field-mouse would be sad if she ran away. 'No, I mustn't come!'she said.

'Farewell, dear good little girl!'said the swallow, and flew off into the sunshine. Thumbelina gazed after him with the tears standing in her eyes, for she was very fond of the swallow.

'Tweet, tweet!' sang the bird, and flew into the green wood. Thumbelina was very unhappy. She was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sowed in the field over the field-mouse's home grew up high into the air, and made a thick forest for the poor little girl, who was only an inch high."
thumbelina,19,"'Now you are to be a bride, Thumbelina!'said the field-mouse, 'for our neighbour has proposed for you! What a piece of fortune for a poor child like you! Now you must set to work at your linen for your dowry, for nothing must be lacking if you are to become the wife of our neighbour, the mole!'

Thumbelina had to spin all day long, and every evening the mole visited her, and told her that when the summer was over the sun would not shine so hot; now it was burning the earth as hard as a stone. Yes, when the summer had passed, they would keep the wedding.

But she was not at all pleased about it, for she did not like the stupid mole. Every morning when the sun was rising, and every evening when it was setting, she would steal out of the house-door, and when the breeze parted the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky through them, she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside, and longed to see her dear swallow again. But he never came; no doubt he had flown away far into the great green wood."
thumbelina,20,"By the autumn Thumbelina had finished the dowry.

'In four weeks you will be married!'said the field-mouse; 'don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my sharp white teeth! You will get a fine husband! The King himself has not such a velvet coat. His store-room and cellar are full, and you should be thankful for that.'

Well, the wedding-day arrived. The mole had come to fetch Thumbelina to live with him deep down under the ground, never to come out into the warm sun again, for that was what he didn't like. The poor little girl was very sad; for now she must say good-bye to the beautiful sun."
thumbelina,21,"'Farewell, bright sun!'she cried, stretching out her arms towards it, and taking another step outside the house; for now the corn had been reaped, and only the dry stubble was left standing. 'Farewell, farewell!'she said, and put her arms round a little red flower that grew there. 'Give my love to the dear swallow when you see him!'

'Tweet, tweet!' sounded in her ear all at once. She looked up. There was the swallow flying past! As soon as he saw Thumbelina, he was very glad. She told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone, and she could not help bursting into tears.

'The cold winter is coming now,' said the swallow. 'I must fly away to warmer lands: will you come with me? You can sit on my back, and we will fly far away from the ugly mole and his dark house, over the mountains, to the warm countries where the sun shines more brightly than here, where it is always summer, and there are always beautiful flowers. Do come with me, dear little Thumbelina, who saved my life when I lay frozen in the dark tunnel!'"
thumbelina,22,"'Yes, I will go with you,' said Thumbelina, and got on the swallow's back, with her feet on one of his outstretched wings. Up he flew into the air, over woods and seas, over the great mountains where the snow is always lying. And if she was cold she crept under his warm feathers, only keeping her little head out to admire all the beautiful things in the world beneath. At last they came to warm lands; there the sun was brighter, the sky seemed twice as high, and in the hedges hung the finest green and purple grapes; in the woods grew oranges and lemons: the air was scented with myrtle and mint, and on the roads were pretty little children running about and playing with great gorgeous butterflies. But the swallow flew on farther, and it became more and more beautiful. Under the most splendid green trees besides a blue lake stood a glittering white-marble castle. Vines hung about the high pillars; there were many swallows'nests, and in one of these lived the swallow who was carrying Thumbelina.

'Here is my house!' said he. 'But it won't do for you to live with me; I am not tidy enough to please you. Find a home for yourself in one of the lovely flowers that grow down there; now I will set you down, and you can do whatever you like.'

'That will be splendid!' said she, clapping her little hands."
thumbelina,23,"There lay a great white marble column which had fallen to the ground and broken into three pieces, but between these grew the most beautiful white flowers. The swallow flew down with Thumbelina, and set her upon one of the broad leaves. But there, to her astonishment, she found a tiny little man sitting in the middle of the flower, as white and transparent as if he were made of glass; he had the prettiest golden crown on his head, and the most beautiful wings on his shoulders; he himself was no bigger than Thumbelina. He was the spirit of the flower. In each blossom there dwelt a tiny man or woman; but this one was the King over the others.

'How handsome he is!' whispered Thumbelina to the swallow."
thumbelina,24,"The little Prince was very much frightened at the swallow, for in comparison with one so tiny as himself he seemed a giant. But when he saw Thumbelina, he was delighted, for she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. So he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers, asking her her name, and if she would be his wife, and then she would be Queen of all the flowers. Yes! he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the black-velvet coat. So she said ""Yes"" to the noble Prince. And out of each flower came a lady and gentleman, each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them. Each brought Thumbelina a present, but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back, and now she too could fly from flower to flower."
thumbelina,25,"They all wished her joy, and the swallow sat above in his nest and sang the wedding march, and that he did as well as he could; but he was sad, because he was very fond of Thumbelina and did not want to be separated from her.

'You shall not be called Thumbelina!' said the spirit of the flower to her; 'that is an ugly name, and you are much too pretty for that. We will call you May Blossom.'

'Farewell, farewell!' said the little swallow with a heavy heart, and flew away to farther lands, far, far away, right back to Denmark. There he had a little nest above a window, where his wife lived, who can tell fairy-stories. 'Tweet, tweet!' he sang to her. And that is the way we learnt the whole story."
torre-jeppe,1,"In a church-nave a specter sat night by night, and the specter's name
was Torre Jeppe. He was a dried-up corpse that could not decay. One
night three tailors were working at a farmstead in the neighborhood.
They were laughing and joking, and among other things they asked the
girl in the house, who was known to be brave, what they would have to
give her to go to church and fetch back Torre Jeppe. She could trust
herself to do it, was her answer; but they must give her a dress of
home-spun wool for her trouble. That she should surely have, said the
tailors, for they did not believe the girl would dare such a venture.
Yet she took the tailors at their word and really went."
torre-jeppe,2,"When she reached the church, she took Torre Jeppe on her back, carried
him home and sat him down on the bench beside the tailors. They
timidly moved away; but Torre Jeppe moved after them, and looked at
them with his big eyes until they nearly lost their reason. In their
terror they begged the girl in the name of God to deliver them from
the specter. They would gladly give her another dress if she would
only carry the dead man away again. They had no need to tell her
twice, for she took Torre Jeppe on her back, and dragged him away
again."
torre-jeppe,3,"But when she tried to set him down in the place where she had found
him, he did not want to let her go; but clasped his arms firmly about
her neck. In vain she said to him several times: ""Torre Jeppe, let me
go!"" At last he said: ""I will not let you go until you promise me that
you will go this very night to the brook and ask three times: 'Anna
Perstochter, do you forgive Torre Jeppe?'"" The girl promised to do as
he said, and he at once released her. The brook was a good mile off;
but she went there and asked three times in a loud voice, as she had
promised: ""Anna Perstochter, do you forgive Torre Jeppe?"" And when she
had called the third time a woman's voice replied from out of the
water: ""If God has forgiven him, then I, too, forgive him!"""
torre-jeppe,4,"When the girl came back to the church Torre Jeppe asked eagerly: ""What
did she say?"" ""Well, if God has forgiven you, then she, too, will
forgive you!"" Then Torre Jeppe thanked her and said: ""Come back again
before sunrise, and you shall receive your reward for the service you
have done me."" The girl went back at sunrise, and in the place where
the phantom had been sitting she found a bushel of silver coin. In
addition she received the two dresses promised her by the tailors. But
Torre Jeppe was never seen again."
troll-wedding,1,"One summer, a long, long time ago, the folk of Melbustad went up to the
hill pastures with their herd. But they had been there only a short time
when the cattle began to grow so restless that it was impossible to keep
them in order. A number of different maidens tried to manage them, but
without avail; until one came who was betrothed, and whose betrothal had
but recently been celebrated. Then the cattle suddenly quieted down, and
were easy to handle. So the maiden remained alone in the hills with no
other company than a dog. And one afternoon as she sat in the hut, it
seemed to her that her sweetheart came, sat down beside her, and began
to talk about their getting married at once. But she sat still and made
no reply, for she noticed a strangeness about him. By and by, more and
more people came in. They began to cover the table with silverware,
and bring on dishes. The bridesmaids brought the bridal crown, and
the ornaments, and a handsome bridal gown. They dressed her, and put
the crown on her head, as was the custom in those days, and they put
rings on her hands."
troll-wedding,2,"And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there.
They were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked
in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they
followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,
and climbed the hills. When he drew near, there stood a number of
horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,
looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting
together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people
from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At
that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one
larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went
in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing
but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
troll-wedding,3,"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked
around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty
dishes had turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads and the
like.

""What does it all mean?"" said he. ""You are sitting here in all your
glory, just like a bride?""

""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here
yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!""

""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who
had taken my shape!"""
troll-wedding,4,"Then she gradually came to her senses. Not until long afterward was
she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that
her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been
there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that
they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day."
troll-wife,1,"Once upon a time, long, long years ago, there lived a well-to-do old
couple on a homestead up in Hadeland. They had a son, who was a dragoon,
a big, handsome fellow. They had a pasture in the hills, and the hut was
not like most of the herdsmen's huts; but was well and solidly built,
and even had a chimney, a roof and a window. And there they spent the
summer. But when they came back home in the fall, the wood-cutters and
huntsmen and fishermen. And whoever else had business in the woods at
that time, noticed that the mountain folk had carried on its tricks with
their herd. And among the mountain folk was a maiden who was so
beautiful that her like had never been seen."
troll-wife,2,"The son had often heard tell of her, and one fall, when his parents had
already come home from the mountain pasture, he put on his full uniform,
saddled his service horse, thrust his pistols in the holsters, and thus
rode up into the hills. When he rode toward the pasture, such a fire
burned in the herdsman's hut that it lit up every road, and then he knew
that the mountain folk were inside. So he tied his horse to a pine-tree,
took a pistol from its holster, crept up to the hut, and peeped through
the window. And there sat an old man and a woman who were quite crooked and shriveled up with age, and so unspeakably ugly that he had never seen anything like it in his life; but with them was a maiden, and she was so surpassingly beautiful that he fell in love with her at once, and felt that he could not live without her. All had cow's tails, and th lovely maiden, too. And he could see that they had only just arrived, for everything was in disorder. The maiden was busy washing the ugly old man, and the woman was building a fire under the great cheese-kettle on the hearth."
troll-wife,3,"At that moment the dragoon flung open the door, and shot off his pistol
right above the maiden's head, so that she tottered and fell to the
ground. And then she grew every bit as ugly as she had been beautiful
before, and she had a nose as long as a pistol-case.

""Now you may take her, for now she belongs to you!"" said the old man.
But the dragoon stood as though rooted to the spot; stood where he
stood, and could not take a single step, either forward or backward.
Then the old man began to wash the girl; and she looked a little better. 
Her nose was only half its original size, and her ugly cow's tail was
tied back; but she was not as handsome, and any one who said so would
not have been telling the truth."
troll-wife,4,"""Now she is yours, my proud dragoon! Take her up before you on your
horse, and ride into town and marry her. And you need only set the
table for us in the little room in the bake-house; for we do not want
to be with the other wedding-guests,"" said the old monster, her father,
""but when the dishes make the round, you can stop in where we are.""

He did not dare do anything else, and took her up before him on his
horse, and made ready to marry her. But before she went to church, the
bride begged one of the bridesmaids to stand close behind her, so that
no one could see her tail fall off when the priest joined their hands.

So the wedding was celebrated, and when the dishes made the round, the
bridegroom went out into the room where the table had been set for the
old folk from the mountain. And at that time there was nothing to be
seen there; but after the wedding-guests had gone, there was so much
gold and silver, and such a pile of money lying there, as he had never
seen together before."
troll-wife,5,"For a long time all went well. Whenever guests came, his wife laid the
table for the old folk in the bake-house, and on each occasion so much
money was left lying there, that before long they did not know what to
do with it all. But ugly she was, and ugly she remained, and he was
heartily weary of her. So it was bound to happen that he sometimes flew
into a rage, and threatened her with cuffs and blows. Once he wanted to
go to town, and since it was fall, and the ground already frozen, the
horse had first to be shod. So he went into the smithy--for he himself
was a notable farrier--but, no matter what lie did, the horse-shoe was
either too large or too small, and would not fit at all. He had no other
horse at home, and he toiled away until noon and on into the afternoon.
""Will you never make an end of your shoeing?"" asked his wife. ""You are
not a very good husband; but you are a far worse farrier. I see there is
nothing left for me but to go into the smithy myself and shoe the horse.
This shoe is too large, you should have made it smaller, and that one is
too small, you should have made it larger."""
troll-wife,6,"She went into the smithy, and the first thing she did was to take the
horse-shoe in both hands and bend it straight.

""There, look at it,"" said she, ""that is how you must do it."" And with
that she bent it together again as though it were made of lead. ""Now
hold up the horse's leg,"" said she, and the horse-shoe fitted to a hair,
so that the best farrier could not have bettered it.

""You have a great deal of strength in your fingers,"" said her husband,
and he looked at her.

""Do you think so?"" was her reply. ""What would have happened to me had
you been as strong? But I love you far too dearly ever to use my
strength against you,"" said she.

And from that day on he was the best of husbands."
twelve-brothers,1,"THERE were once upon a time a King and a Queen who lived happily together, and they had twelve children, all of whom were boys. One day the King said to his wife:

'If our thirteenth child is a girl, all her twelve brothers must die, so that she may be very rich and the kingdom hers alone.'

Then he ordered twelve coffins to be made, and filled them with shavings, and placed a little pillow in each. These he put away in an empty room, and, giving the key to his wife, he bade her tell no one of it.

The Queen grieved over the sad fate of her sons and refused to be comforted, so much so that the youngest boy, who was always with her, and whom she had christened Benjamin, said to her one day:

'Dear mother, why are you so sad?'

'My child,' she answered, 'I may not tell you the reason.'"
twelve-brothers,2,"But he left her no peace, till she went and unlocked the room and showed him the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each.

Then she said: 'My dearest Benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for you and your eleven brothers, because if I bring a girl into the world you are all to be killed and buried in them.'

She wept bitterly as she spoke, but her son comforted her and said:

'Don't cry, dear mother; we'll manage to escape somehow, and will fly for our lives.'

'Yes,' replied his mother, 'that is what you must do-go with your eleven brothers out into the wood, and let one of you always sit on the highest tree you can find, keeping watch on the tower of the castle. If I give birth to a little son I will wave a white flag, and then you may safely return; but if I give birth to a little daughter I will wave a red flag, which will warn you to fly away as quickly as you can, and may the kind Heaven have pity on you. Every night I will get up and pray for you, in winter that you may always have a fire to warm yourselves by, and in summer that you may not languish in the heat.'"
twelve-brothers,3,"Then she blessed her sons and they set out into the wood. They found a very high oak tree, and there they sat, turn about, keeping their eyes always fixed on the castle tower. On the twelfth day, when the turn came to Benjamin, he noticed a flag waving in the air, but alas! it was not white, but blood red, the sign which told them they must all die. When the brothers heard this they were very angry, and said:

'Shall we forsooth suffer death for the sake of a wretched girl? Let us swear vengeance, and vow that wherever and whenever we shall meet one of her sex, she shall die at our hands.'"
twelve-brothers,4,"Then they went their way deeper into the wood, and in the middle of it, where it was thickest and darkest, they came upon a little enchanted house which stood empty.

'Here,' they said, 'let us take up our abode, and you, Benjamin, you are the youngest and weakest, you shall stay at home and keep house for us; we others will go out and fetch food.' So they went forth into the wood, and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons, and any other game they came across. They always brought their spoils home to Benjamin, who soon learnt to make them into dainty dishes. So they lived for ten years in this little house, and the time slipped merrily away."
twelve-brothers,5,"In the meantime their little sister at home was growing up quickly. She was kind-hearted and of a fair countenance, and she had a gold star right in the middle of her forehead. One day a big washing was going on at the palace, and the girl looking down from her window saw twelve men's shirts hanging up to dry, and asked her mother:

'Who in the world do these shirts belong to? Surely they are far too small for my father?'

And the Queen answered sadly: 'Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers.'

'But where are my twelve brothers?' said the girl. 'I have never even heard of them.'

'Heaven alone knows in what part of the wide world they are wandering,' replied her mother.

Then she took the girl and opened the locked-up room; she showed her the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each."
twelve-brothers,6,"'These coffins,' she said, 'were intended for your brothers, but they stole secretly away before you were born.'

Then she to tell her all that had happened, and when she had finished her daughter said:

'Do not cry, dearest mother; I will go and seek my brothers till I find them.'

So she took the twelve shirts and went on straight into the middle of the big wood. She walked all day long, and came in the evening to the little enchanted house. She stepped in and found a youth who, marvelling at her beauty, at the royal robes she wore, and at the golden star on her forehead, asked her where she came from and whither she was going.

'I am a Princess,' she answered, 'and am seeking for my twelve brothers. I mean to wander as far as the blue sky stretches over the earth till I find them.'"
twelve-brothers,7,"Then she showed him the twelve shirts which she had taken with her, and Benjamin saw that it must be his sister, and said:

'I am Benjamin, your youngest brother.'

So they wept for joy, and kissed and hugged each other again and again. After a time Benjamin said:

'Dear sister, there is still a little difficulty, for we had all agreed that any girl we met should die at our hands, because it was for the sake of a girl that we had to leave our kingdom.'

'But,' she replied, 'I will gladly die if by that means I can restore my twelve brothers to their own.'

'No,' he answered, 'there is no need for that; only go and hide under that tub till our eleven brothers come in, and I'll soon make matters right with them.'"
twelve-brothers,8,"She did as she was bid, and soon the others came home from the chase and sat down to supper.

'Well, Benjamin, what's the news?' they asked. But he replied, 'I like that; have you nothing to tell me?'

'No,' they answered.

Then he said: 'Well, now, you've been out in the wood all the day and I've stayed quietly at home, and all the same I know more than you do.'

'Then tell us,' they cried.

But he answered: 'Only on condition that you promise faithfully that the first girl we meet shall not be killed.'

'She shall be spared,' they promised, 'only tell us the news.'

Then Benjamin said: 'Our sister is here!' and he lifted up the tub and the Princess stepped forward, with her royal robes and with the golden star on her forehead, looking so lovely and sweet and charming that they all fell in love with her on the spot."
twelve-brothers,9,"They arranged that she should stay at home with Benjamin and help him in the house work, while the rest of the brothers went out into the wood and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons. And Benjamin and his sister cooked their meals for them. She gathered herbs to cook the vegetables in, fetched the wood, and watched the pots on the fire, and always when her eleven brothers returned she had their supper ready for them. Besides this, she kept the house in order, tidied all the rooms, and made herself so generally useful that her brothers were delighted, and they all lived happily together.

One day the two at home prepared a fine feast, and when they were all assembled they sat down and ate and drank and made merry."
twelve-brothers,10,"Now there was a little garden round the enchanted house, in which grew twelve tall lilies. The girl, wishing to please her brothers, plucked the twelve flowers, meaning to present one to each of them as they sat at supper. But hardly had she plucked the flowers when her brothers were turned into twelve ravens, who flew croaking over the wood, and the house and garden vanished also.

So the poor girl found herself left all alone in the wood, and as she looked round her she noticed an old woman standing close beside her, who said:

'My child, what have you done? Why didn't you leave the flowers alone? They were your twelve brothers. Now they are changed for ever into ravens.'"
twelve-brothers,11,"The girl asked, sobbing: 'Is there no means of setting them free?'

'No,' said the old woman, 'there is only one way in the whole world, and that is so difficult that you won't free them by it, for you would have to be dumb and not laugh for seven years, and if you spoke a single word, though but an hour were wanting to the time, your silence would all have been in vain, and that one word would slay your brothers.'

Then the girl said to herself: 'If that is all I am quite sure I can free my brothers.' So she searched for a high tree, and when she had found one she climbed up it and spun all day long, never laughing or speaking one word."
twelve-brothers,12,"Now it happened one day that a King who was hunting in the wood had a large greyhound, who ran sniffing to the tree on which the girl sat, and jumped round it, yelping and barking furiously. The King's attention was attracted, and when he looked up and beheld the beautiful Princess with the golden star on her forehead, he was so enchanted by her beauty that he asked her on the spot to be his wife. She gave no answer, but nodded slightly with her head. Then he climbed up the tree himself, lifted her down, put her on his horse and bore her home to his palace.

The marriage was celebrated with much pomp and ceremony, but the bride neither spoke nor laughed."
twelve-brothers,13,"When they had lived a few years happily together, the King's mother, who was a wicked old woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King:

'She is only a low-born beggar maid that you have married; who knows what mischief she is up to? If she is deaf and can't speak, she might at least laugh; depend upon it, those who don't laugh have a bad conscience.' At first the King paid no heed to her words, but the old woman harped so long on the subject, and accused the young Queen of so many bad things, that at last he let himself be talked over, and condemned his beautiful wife to death."
twelve-brothers,14,"So a great fire was lit in the courtyard of the palace, where she was to be burnt, and the King watched the proceedings from an upper window, crying bitterly the while, for he still loved his wife dearly. But just as she had been bound to the stake, and the flames were licking her garments with their red tongues, the very last moment of the seven years had come. Then a sudden rushing sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens were seen flying overhead. They swooped downwards, and as soon as they touched the ground they turned into her twelve brothers, and she knew that she had freed them."
twelve-brothers,15,"They quenched the flames and put out the fire, and, unbinding their dear sister from the stake, they kissed and hugged her again and again. And now that she was able to open her mouth and speak, she told the King why she had been dumb and not able to laugh.

The King rejoiced greatly when he heard she was innocent, and they all lived happily ever afterwards."
two-maidens,1,"Have you ever seen a maiden? I mean what our pavers call a maiden, a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the roads. A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad below, and girt round with iron rings. At the top she is narrow, and has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick forms the arms of the maiden.

In the shed stood two Maidens of this kind. They had their place among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes; and to all this company the news had come that the Maidens were no longer to be called ""maidens,"" but ""hand-rammers,"" which word was the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the name of ""the maiden."""
two-maidens,2,"Now, there are among us human creatures certain individuals who are known as ""emancipated women,"" as, for instance, principals of institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one leg, milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of emancipated women the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves. They were ""maidens"" among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this honorable appellation, and let themselves be miscalled ""rammers."""
two-maidens,3,"""Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and we won't be called things--that's insulting us."" 
""My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,"" said the youngest, who was betrothed to a paver's hammer; and the hammer is the thing which drives great piles into the earth, like a machine, and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar way. ""He wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won't have my name changed."" 
""And I,"" said the elder one, ""would rather have both my arms broken off."""
two-maidens,4,"But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and the Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he considered himself a quarter of a coach, because he went about upon one wheel. 
""I must submit to your notice,"" he said, ""that the name 'maiden' is common enough, and not nearly so refined as 'hand-rammer,' or 'stamper,' which latter has also been proposed, and through which you would be introduced into the category of seals; and only think of the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that gives effect to the laws! No, in your case I would surrender my maiden name."" 
""No, certainly not!"" exclaimed the elder. ""I am too old for that."""
two-maidens,5,"""I presume you have never heard of what is called 'European necessity?'"" observed the honest Measuring Tape. ""One must be able to adapt one's self to time and circumstances, and if there is a law that the 'maiden' is to be called 'hand-rammer,' why, she must be called 'hand-rammer,' and no pouting will avail, for everything has its measure."" 
""No; if there must be a change,"" said the younger, ""I should prefer to be called 'Missy,' for that reminds one a little of maidens."" 
""But I would rather be chopped to chips,"" said the elder. 
At last they all went to work. The Maidens rode--that is, they were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; but still they were called ""hand-rammers."""
two-maidens,6,"""Mai--!"" they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement. ""Mai--!"" and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word ""maiden;"" but they broke off short, and swallowed the last syllable; for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to protest. But they always called each other ""maiden,"" and praised the good old days in which everything had been called by its right name, and those who were maidens were called maidens. And they remained as they were; for the hammer really broke off his engagement with the younger one, for nothing would suit him but he must have a maiden for his bride."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,1,"In a lonely forest, there once lived a man and his wife, who had a son.
The father went forth every day, according to the custom of the Indians,
to hunt for food to supply his family.

One day, while he was absent, his wife, on going out of the lodge,
looked toward the lake that was near, and she saw a very large man
walking on the water, and coming fast toward the lodge. He was already
so near that she could not, if she had wished to, escape by flight. She
thought to herself, ""What shall I say to the monster?""

As he advanced rapidly, she ran in, and taking the hand of her son, a
boy of three or four years old, she led him out. Speaking very loud,
""See, my son,"" she said, ""your grandfather;"" and then added, in a tone
of appeal and supplication, ""he will have pity on us.""

The giant approached and said, with a loud ha! ha! ""Yes, my son;"" and
added, addressing the woman, ""Have you any thing to eat?"""
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,2,"By good luck the lodge was well supplied with meats of various kinds;
the woman thought to please him by handing him these, which were savory
and carefully prepared. But he pushed them away in disgust, saying, ""I
smell fire;"" and, not waiting to be invited, he seized upon the carcass
of a deer which lay by the door, and dispatched it almost without
stopping to take breath.

When the hunter came home he was surprised to see the monster, he was so
very frightful. He had again brought a deer, which he had no sooner put
down than the cannibal seized it, tore it in pieces, and devoured it as
though he had been fasting for a week. The hunter looked on in fear and
astonishment, and in a whisper he told his wife that he was afraid for
their lives, as this monster was one whom Indians call Weendigoes. He
did not even dare to speak to him, nor did the cannibal say a word, but
as soon as he had finished his meal, he stretched himself down and fell
asleep.

In the evening the Weendigo told the people that he should go out a
hunting; and he strided away toward the North. Toward morning he
returned, all besmeared with blood, but he did not make known where he
had been nor of what kind of game he had been in quest; although the
hunter and his wife had dreadful suspicions of the sport in which he had
been engaged. Withal his hunger did not seem to be staid, for he took
up the deer which the hunter had brought in, and devoured it eagerly,
leaving the family to make their meal of the dried meats which had been
reserved in the lodge."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,3,"In this manner the Weendigo and the hunter's family lived for some time,
and it surprised them that the monster never attempted their lives;
although he never slept at night, but always went out and returned, by
the break of day, stained with blood, and looking very wild and
famished. When there was no deer to be had wherewith to finish his
repast, he said nothing. In truth he was always still and gloomy, and he
seldom spoke to any of them; when he did, his discourse was chiefly
addressed to the boy.

One evening, after he had thus sojourned with them for many weeks, he
informed the hunter that the time had now arrived for him to take his
leave, but that before doing so, he would give him a charm that would
bring good luck to his lodge. He presented to him two arrows, and
thanking the hunter and his wife for their kindness, the Weendigo
departed, saying, as he left them, that he had all the world to travel
over.

The hunter and his wife were happy when he was gone, for they had looked
every moment to have been devoured by him. He tried the arrows, and they
never failed to bring down whatever they were aimed at.

They had lived on, prosperous and contented, for a year, when, one day,
the hunter being absent, his wife on going out of the lodge, saw
something like a black cloud approaching."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,4,"She looked until it came near, when she perceived that it was another
Weendigo or Giant Cannibal. Remembering the good conduct of the other,
she had no fear of this one, and asked him to look into the lodge.

He did so; and finding after he had glared around, that there was no
food at hand, he grew very wroth, and, being sorely disappointed, he
took the lodge and threw it to the winds. He seemed hardly at first to
notice the woman in his anger; but presently he cast a fierce glance
upon her, and seizing her by the waist, in spite of her cries and
entreaties, he bore her off. To the little son, who ran to and fro
lamenting, he paid no heed.

At night-fall, when the hunter returned from the forest, he was amazed.
His lodge was gone, and he saw his son sitting near the spot where it
had stood, shedding tears. The son pointed in the direction the Weendigo
had taken, and as the father hurried along he found the remains of his
wife strewn upon the ground.

The hunter blackened his face, and vowed in his heart that he would have
revenge. He built another lodge, and gathering together the bones of
his wife, he placed them in the hollow part of a dry tree."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,5,"He left his boy to take care of the lodge while he was absent, hunting
and roaming about from place to place, striving to forget his
misfortune, and searching for the wicked Weendigo.

He had been gone but a little while one morning, when his son shot his
arrows out through the top of the lodge, and running out to look for
them, he could find them nowhere. The boy had been trying his luck, and
he was puzzled that he had shot his shafts entirely out of sight.

His father made him more arrows, and when he was again left alone, he
shot one of them out; but although he looked as sharply as he could
toward the spot where it fell, and ran thither at once, he could not
find it.

He shot another, which was lost in the same way; and returning to the
lodge to replenish his quiver, he happened to espy one of the lucky
arrows, which the first Weendigo had given to his father, hanging upon
the side of the lodge. He reached up, and having secured it, he shot it
out at the opening, and immediately running out to find where it fell,
he was surprised to see a beautiful boy just in the act of taking it up,
and hurrying away with it to a large tree, where he disappeared."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,6,"The hunter's son followed, and having come to the tree, he beheld the
face of the boy looking out through an opening in the hollow part.

""Ha! ha!"" he said, ""my friend, come out and play with me;"" and he urged
the boy till he consented. They played and shot their arrows by turns.

Suddenly the young boy said, ""Your father is coming. We must stop.
Promise me that you will not tell him.""

The hunter's son promised, and the other disappeared in the tree.

When the hunter returned from the chase, his son sat demurely by the
fire. In the course of the evening he asked his father to make him a new
bow; and when he was questioned as to the use he could find for two
bows, he answered that one might break or get lost.

The father pleased at his son's diligence in the practice of the bow,
made him the two weapons; and the next day, as soon as his father had
gone away, the boy ran to the hollow tree, and invited his little friend
to come out and play; at the same time presenting to him the new bow.
They went and played in the lodge together, and in their sport they
raised the ashes all over it.

Suddenly again the youngest said, ""Your father is coming, I must leave."""
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,7,"He again exacted a promise of secresy, and went back to his tree. The
eldest took his seat near the fire.

When the hunter came in he was surprised to see the ashes scattered
about. ""Why, my son,"" he said, ""you must have played very hard to day to
raise such a dust all alone.""

""Yes,"" the boy answered, ""I was very lonesome, and I ran round and
round--that is the cause of it.""

The next day the hunter made ready for the chase as usual. The boy said,
""Father, try and hunt all day, and see what you can kill.""

He had no sooner set out than the boy called his friend, and they played
and chased each other round the lodge. They had great delight in each
other's company, and made merry by the hour. The hunter was again
returning, and came to a rising ground, which caught the winds as they
passed, and he heard his son laughing and making a noise, but the sounds
as they reached him on the hill-top, seemed as if they arose from two
persons playing.

At the same time the younger boy stopped, and after saying ""Your father
is coming,"" he stole away, under cover of the high grass, to his hollow
tree, which was not far off."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,8,"The hunter, on entering, found his son sitting by the fire, very quiet
and unconcerned, although he saw that all the articles of the lodge were
lying thrown about in all directions.

""Why, my son,"" he said ""you must play very hard every day; and what is
it that you do, all alone, to throw the lodge in such confusion?""

The boy again had his excuse. ""Father,"" he answered, ""I play in this
manner: I chase and drag my blanket around the lodge, and that is the
reason you see the ashes spread about.""

The hunter was not satisfied until his son had shown him how he played
with the blanket, which he did so adroitly as to set his father
laughing, and at last drive him out of the lodge with the great clouds
of ashes that he raised.

The next morning the boy renewed his request that his father should be
absent all day, and see if he could not kill two deer. The hunter
thought this a strange desire on the part of his son, but as he had
always humored the boy, he went into the forest as usual, bent on
accomplishing his wish, if he could.

As soon as he was out of sight, his son hastened to his young companion
at the tree, and they continued their sports.

The father on nearing his home in the evening, as he reached the rising
ground, again heard the sounds of play and laughter; and as the wind
brought them straight to his ear, he was now certain that there were two
voices."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,9,"The boy from the tree had no more than time to escape, when the hunter
entered, and found his son, sitting as usual, near the fire. When he
cast his eyes around, he saw that the lodge was in greater confusion
than before. ""My son,"" he said, ""you must be very foolish when alone to
play so. But, tell me, my son; I heard two voices, I am sure;"" and he
looked closely on the prints of the footsteps in the ashes. ""True,"" he
continued, ""here is the print of a foot which is smaller than my son's;""
and he was now satisfied that his suspicions were well founded, and that
some very young person had been the companion of his son.

The boy could not now refuse to tell his father what had happened.

""Father,"" he said, ""I found a boy in the hollow of that tree, near the
lodge, where you placed my mother's bones.""

Strange thoughts came over the mind of the hunter; did his wife live
again in this beautiful child?

Fearful of disturbing the dead, he did not dare to visit the place where
he had deposited her remains.

He, however, engaged his son to entice the boy to a dead tree, by the
edge of a wood, where they could kill many flying-squirrels by setting
it on fire. He said that he would conceal himself near by, and take the
boy."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,10,"The next day the hunter accordingly went into the woods, and his son,
calling the boy from the tree, urged him to go with him to kill the
squirrels. The boy objected that his father was near, but he was at
length prevailed on to go, and after they had fired the tree, and while
they were busy killing or taking the squirrels, the hunter suddenly made
his appearance, and clasped the strange boy in his arms. He cried out,
""Kago, kago, don't, don't. You will tear my clothes!"" for he was clad in
a fine apparel, which shone as if it had been made of a beautiful
transparent skin. The father reassured him by every means in his power.

By constant kindness and gentle words the boy was reconciled to remain
with them; but chiefly by the presence of his young friend, the hunter's
son, to whom he was fondly attached. The children were never parted from
each other; and when the hunter looked upon the strange boy, he seemed
to see living in him the better spirit of his lost wife."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,11,"He was thankful
to the Great Spirit for this act of goodness, and in his heart he felt
assured that in time the boy would show great virtue, and in some way
avenge him on the wicked Weendigo who had destroyed the companion of his
lodge.

The hunter grew at ease in his spirit, and gave all of the time he could
spare from the chase to the society of the two children; but, what
affected him the most, both of his sons, although they were well-formed
and beautiful, grew no more in stature, but remained children still.
Every day they resembled each other more and more, and they never ceased
to sport and divert themselves in the innocent ways of childhood."
weendigoes-and-the-bone-dwarf,12,"One day the hunter had gone abroad with his bow and arrows, leaving, at
the request of the strange boy, one of the two shafts which the friendly
Weendigo had given to him, behind in the lodge.

When he returned, what were his surprise and joy to see stretched dead
by his lodge-door, the black giant who had slain his wife. He had been
stricken down by the magic shaft in the hands of the little stranger
from the tree; and ever after the boy, or the Bone-Dwarf as he was
called, was the guardian and good genius of the lodge, and no evil
spirit, giant, or Weendigo, dared approach it to mar their peace."
werewolf,1,"Once upon a time there was a king, who reigned over a great kingdom. He had a queen, but only a single daughter, a girl. In consequence the little girl was the apple of her parents' eyes. They loved her above everything else in the world, and their dearest thought was the pleasure they would take in her when she was older. But the unexpected often happens. Before the king's daughter began to grow up, the queen her mother fell ill and died. It is not hard to imagine the grief that reigned, not alone in the royal castle, but throughout the land; for the queen had been beloved of all. The king grieved so that he would not marry again, and his one joy was the little princess."
werewolf,2,"A long time passed, and with each succeeding day the king's daughter grew taller and more beautiful, and her father granted her every wish. Now there were a number of women who had nothing to do but wait on the princess and carry out her commands. Among them was a woman who had formerly married and had two daughters. She had an engaging appearance, a smooth tongue and a winning way of talking, and she was as soft and pliable as silk; but at heart she was full of machinations and falseness. Now when the queen died, she at once began to plan how she might marry the king, so that her daughters might be kept like royal princesses. With this end in view, she drew the young princess to her. She paid her the most fulsome compliments on everything she said and did, and was forever bringing the conversation around to how happy she would be were the king to take another wife."
werewolf,3,"There was much said on this head, early and late, and before very long the princess came to believe that the woman knew all there was to know about everything. So she asked her what sort of a woman the king ought to choose for a wife. The woman answered as sweet as honey: ""It is not my affair to give advice in this matter; yet he should choose for queen some one who is kind to the little princess. For one thing I know, and that is, were I fortunate enough to be chosen, my one thought would be to do all I could for the little princess, and if she wished to wash her hands, one of my daughters would have to hold the wash-bowl and the other hand her the towel."" This and much more she told the king's daughter, and the princess believed it, as children will."
werewolf,4,"From that day forward the princess gave her father no peace, and begged him again and again to marry the good court lady. Yet he did not want to marry her. But the king's daughter gave him no rest. She urged him again and again, as the false court lady had persuaded her to do. Finally, one day, when she again brought up the matter, the king cried: ""I can see you will end by having your own way about this, even though it be entirely against my will. But I will do so only on one condition."" ""What is the condition?"" asked the princess. ""If I marry again,"" said the king, ""it is only because of your ceaseless pleading. Therefore you must promise that, if in the future you are not satisfied with your step-mother or your step-sisters, not a single lament or complaint on your part reaches my ears."" This she promised the king, and it was agreed that he should marry the court lady and make her queen of the whole country."
werewolf,5,"As time passed on, the king's daughter had grown to be the most beautiful maiden to be found far and wide. The queen's daughters, on the other hand, were homely, evil of disposition, and no one knew any good of them. Hence it was not surprising that many youths came from East and West to sue for the princess's hand; but that none of them took any interest in the queen's daughters. This made the step-mother very angry;. She concealed her rage, and was as sweet and friendly as ever. Among the wooers was a king's son from another country. He was young and brave, and since he loved the princess dearly, she accepted his proposal and they plighted their troth. The queen observed this with an angry eye, for it would have pleased her had the prince chosen one of her own daughters. She therefor made up her mind that the young pair should never be happy together, and from that time on thought only of how she might part them from each other."
werewolf,6,"An opportunity soon offered itself. News came that the enemy had entered the land, and the king was compelled to go to war. Now the princess began to find out the kind of step-mother she had. For no sooner had the king departed than the queen showed her true nature, and was just as harsh and unkind as she formerly had pretended to be friendly and obliging. Not a day went by without her scolding and threatening the princess and the queen's daughters were every bit as malicious as their mother. But the king's son, the lover of the princess, found himself in even worse position. He had gone hunting one day, had lost his way, and could not find his people. Then the queen used her black arts and turned him into a werewolf, to wander through the forest for the remainder of his life in that shape. When evening came and there was no sign of the prince, his people returned home, and one can imagine what sorrow they caused when the princess learned how the hunt had ended. She grieved, wept day and night, and was not to be consoled. But the queen laughed at her grief, and her heart was filled with joy to think that all had turned out exactly as she wished."
werewolf,7,"Now it chanced one day, as the king's daughter was sitting alone in her room, that she thought she would go herself into the forest where the prince had disappeared. She went to her step-mother and begged permission to go out into the forest, in order to forget her surpassing grief. The queen did not want to grant her request, for she always preferred saying no to yes. But the princess begged her so winningly that at last she was unable to say no, and she ordered one of her daughters to go along with her and watch her. That caused a great deal of discussion, for neither of the step-daughters wanted to go with her. Each made all sorts of excuses, and asked what pleasures were there in going with the king's daughter, who did nothing but cry. But the queen had the last word in the end, and ordered that one of her daughters must accompany the princess, even though it be against her will. So the girls wandered out of the castle into the forest. The king's daughter walked among the trees, and listened to the song of the birds, and thought of her lover, for whom she longed, and who was now no longer there. And the queen's daughter followed her, vexed, in her malice, with the king's daughter and her sorrow."
werewolf,8,"After they had walked a while, they came to a little hut, lying deep in the dark forest. By then the king's daughter was very thirsty, and wanted to go into the little hut with her step-sister, in order to get a drink of water. But the queen's daughter was much annoyed and said: ""Is it not enough for me to be running around here in the wilderness with you? Now you even want me, who am a princess, to enter that wretched little hut. No, I will not step a foot over the threshold! If you want to go in, why go in alone!"" The king's daughter lost no time; but did as her step-sister advised, and stepped into the little hut. When she entered she saw an old woman sitting there on a bench, so enfeebled by age that her head shook."
werewolf,9,"The princess spoke to her in her usual friendly way: ""Good evening, motherkin. May I ask you for a drink of water?"" ""You are heartily welcome to it,"" said the old woman. ""Who may you be, that step beneath my lowly roof and greet me in so winning a way?"" The king's daughter told her who she was, and that she had gone out to relieve her heart, in order to forget her great grief. ""And what may your great grief be?"" asked the old woman. ""No doubt it is my fate to grieve,"" said the princess, ""and I can never be happy again. I have lost my only love, and God alone knows whether I shall ever see him again."" And she also told her why it was, and the tears ran down her cheeks in streams, so that any one would have felt sorry for her. When she had ended the old woman said: ""You did well in confiding your sorrow to me. I have lived long and may be able to give you a bit of good advice. When you leave here you will see a lily growing from the ground. This lily is not like other lilies, however, but has many strange virtues. Run quickly over to it, and pick it. If you can do that then you need not worry, for then one will appear who will tell you what to do."" Then they parted and the king's daughter thanked her and went her way; while the old woman sat on the bench and wagged her head. But the queen's daughter had been standing without the hut the entire time, vexing herself, and grumbling because the king's daughter had taken so long."
werewolf,10,"So when the latter stepped out, she had to listen to all sorts of abuse from her step-sister, as was to be expected. Yet she paid no attention to her, and thought only of how she might find the flower of which the old woman had spoken. They went through the forest, and suddenly she saw a beautiful white lily growing in their very path. She was much pleased and ran up at once to pick it; but that very moment it disappeared and reappeared somewhat further away."
werewolf,11,"The king's daughter was now filled with eagerness, no longer listened to her step-sister's calls, and kept right on running. Yet each time when she stooped to pick the lily, it suddenly disappeared and reappeared somewhat further away. Thus it went for some time, and the princess was drawn further and further into the deep forest. But the lily continued to stand, and disappear and move further away, and each time the flower seemed larger and more beautiful than before. At length the princess came to a high hill, and as she looked toward its summit, there stood the lily high on the naked rock, glittering as white and radiant as the brightest star. The king's daughter now began to climb the hill, and in her eagerness she paid no attention to stones nor steepness. And when at last she reached the summit of the hill, lo and behold! the lily no longer evaded her grasp; but remained where it was, and the princess stooped and picked it and hid it in her bosom, and so heartfelt was her happiness that she forgot her step-sisters and everything else in the world."
werewolf,12,"For a long time she did not tire of looking at the beautiful flower. Then she suddenly began to wonder what her step-mother would say when she came home after having remained out so long. And she looked around, in order to find the way back to the castle. But as she looked around, behold, the sun had set and no more than a little strip of daylight rested on the summit of the hill. Below her lay the forest, so dark and shadowed that she had no faith in her ability to find the homeward path. And now she grew very sad, for she could think of nothing better to do than to spend the night on the hill-top. She seated herself on the rock, put her hand to her cheek, cried, and thought of her unkind step-mother and step-sisters, and of all the harsh words she would have to endure when she returned. And she thought of her father, the king, who was away at war, and of the love of her heart, whom she would never see again. She grieved so bitterly that she did not even know she wept. Night came and darkness, and the stars rose, and still the princess sat in the same spot and wept. And while she sat there, lost in her thoughts, she heard a voice say: ""Good evening, lovely maiden! Why do you sit here so sad and lonely?"" She stood up hastily, and felt much embarrassed, which was not surprising. When she looked around there was nothing to be seen but a tiny old man, who nodded to her and seemed to be very humble."
werewolf,13,"She answered: ""Yes, it is no doubt my fate to grieve, and never be happy again. I have lost my dearest love, and now I have lost my way in the forest, and am afraid of being devoured by wild beasts."" ""As to that,"" said the old man, ""you need have no fear. If you will do exactly as I say, I will help you."" This made the princess happy; for she felt that all the rest of the world had abandoned her. Then the old man drew out flint and steel and said: ""Lovely maiden, you must first build a fire."" She did as he told her, gathered moss, brush and dry sticks, struck sparks and lit such a fire on the hill-top that the flame blazed up to the skies. That done the old man said: ""Go on a bit and you will find a kettle of tar, and bring the kettle to me."" This the king's daughter did. The old man continued: ""Now put the kettle on the fire."" And the princess did that as well. When the tar began to boil, the old man said: ""Now throw your white lily into the kettle."" The princess thought this a harsh command, and earnestly begged to be allowed to keep the lily. But the old man said: ""Did you not promise to obey my every command? Do as I tell you or you will regret it."" The king's daughter turned away her eyes, and threw the lily into the boiling tar; but it was altogether against her will, so fond had she grown of the beautiful flower."
werewolf,14,"The moment she did so a hollow roar, like that of some wild beast, sounded from the forest. It came nearer, and turned into such a terrible howling that all the surrounding hills reechoed it. Finally there was a cracking and breaking among the trees, the bushes were thrust aside, and the princess saw a great grey wolf come running out of the forest and straight up the hill. She was much frightened and would gladly have run away, had she been able. But the old man said: ""Make haste, run to the edge of the hill and the moment the wolf comes along, upset the kettle on him!"" The princess was terrified, and hardly knew what she was about. Yet she did as the old man said, took the kettle, ran to the edge of the hill, and poured its contents over the wolf just as he was about to run up. And then a strange thing happened: no sooner had she done so, than the wolf was transformed, cast off his thick grey pelt, and in place of the horrible wild beast, there stood a handsome young man, looking up to the hill. And when the king's daughter collected herself and looked at him, she saw that it was really and truly her lover, who had been turned into a werewolf."
werewolf,15,"It is easy to imagine how the princess felt. She opened her arms, and could neither ask questions nor reply to them, so moved and delighted was she. But the prince ran hastily up the hill, embraced her tenderly, and thanked her for delivering him. Nor did he forget the little old man, but thanked him with many civil expressions for his powerful aid. Then they sat down together on the hill-top, and had a pleasant talk. The prince told how he had been turned into a wolf, and of all he had suffered while running about in the forest; and the princess told of her grief, and the many tears she had shed while he had been gone. So they sat the whole night through, and never noticed it until the stars grew pale and it was light enough to see. When the sun rose, they saw that a broad path led from the hill-top straight to the royal castle; for they had a view of the whole surrounding country from the hill-top. Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything out yonder?"" ""Yes,"" said the princess, ""I see a horseman on a foaming horse, riding as fast as he can."" Then the old man said: ""He is a messenger sent on ahead by the king your father. And your father with all his army is following him."" That pleased the princess above all things, and she wanted to descend the hill at once to meet her father. But the old man detained her and said: ""Wait a while, it is too early yet. Let us wait and see how everything turns out."""
werewolf,16,"Time passed and the sun was shining brightly, and its rays fell straight on the royal castle down below. Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything down below?"" ""Yes,"" replied the princess, ""I see a number of people coming out of my father's castle, and some are going along the road, and others into the forest."" The old man said: ""Those are your step-mother's servants. She has sent some to meet the king and welcome him but she has sent others to the forest to look for you."" At these words the princess grew uneasy, and wished to go down to the queen's servants. But the old man withheld her and said: ""Wait a while, and let us first see how everything turns out."""
werewolf,17,"More time passed, and the king's daughter was still looking down the road from which the king would appear, when the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything down below?"" ""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""there is a great commotion in my father's castle, and they are hanging it with black."" The old man said: ""That is your step-mother and her people. They will assure your father that you are dead."" Then the king's daughter felt bitter anguish, and she implored from the depths of her heart: ""Let me go, let me go, so that I may spare my father this anguish!"" But the old man detained her and said: ""No, wait, it is still too early. Let us first see how everything turns out."""
werewolf,18,"Again time passed, the sun lay high above the fields, and the warm air blew over meadow and forest. The royal maid and youth still sat on the hill-top with the old man, where we had left them. Then they saw a little cloud rise against the horizon, far away in the distance, and the little cloud grew larger and larger, and came nearer and nearer along the road, and as it moved one could see it was agleam with weapons, and nodding helmets, and waving flags, one could hear the rattle of swords, and the neighing of horses, and finally recognize the banner of the king. It is not hard to imagine how pleased the king's daughter was, and how she insisted on going down and greeting her father. But the old man held her back and said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything happening at the castle?"" ""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""I can see my step-mother and step-sisters coming out, dressed in mourning, holding white kerchiefs to their faces, and weeping bitterly."" The old man answered: ""Now they are pretending to weep because of your death. Wait just a little while longer. We have not yet seen how everything will turn out."""
werewolf,19,"After a time the old man said again: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything down below?"" ""Yes,"" said the princess, ""I see people bringing a black coffin-now my father is having it opened. Look, the queen and her daughters are down on their knees, and my father is threatening them with his sword!"" Then the old man said: ""Your father wished to see your body, and so your evil step-mother had to confess the truth."" When the princess heard that she said earnestly: ""Let me go, let me go, so that I may comfort my father in his great sorrow!"" But the old man held her back and said: ""Take my advice and stay here a little while longer. We have not yet seen how everything will turn out."""
werewolf,20,"Again time went by, and the king's daughter and the prince and the old man were still sitting on the hill-top. Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! Do you see anything down below?"" ""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""I see my father and my step-sisters and my step-mother with all their following moving this way."" The old man said: ""Now they have started out to look for you. Go down and bring up the wolf's pelt in the gorge."" The king's daughter did as he told her. The old man continued: ""Now stand at the edge of the hill."" And the princess did that, too. Now one could see the queen and her daughters coming along the way, and stopping just below the hill. Then the old man said: ""Now throw down the wolf's pelt!"" The princess obeyed him, and threw down the wolf's pelt according to his command. It fell directly on the evil queen and her daughters. And then a most wonderful thing happened: no sooner had the pelt touched the three evil women than they immediately changed shape, and turning into three horrible werewolves, they ran away as fast as they could into the forest, howling dreadfully."
werewolf,21,"No more had this happened than the king himself arrived at the foot of the hill with his whole retinue. When he looked up and recognized the princess, he could not at first believe his eyes; but stood motionless, thinking her a vision. Then the old man cried: ""Lovely maiden, now hasten, run down and make your father happy!"" There was no need to tell the princess twice. She took her lover by the hand and they ran down the hill. When they came to the king, the princess ran on ahead, fell on her father's neck, and wept with joy. And the young prince wept as well, and the king himself wept; and their meeting was a pleasant sight for every one. There was great joy and many embraces, and the princess told of her evil step-mother and step-sisters and of her lover, and all that she had suffered, and of the old man who had helped them in such a wonderful way. But when the king turned around to thank the old man he had completely vanished, and from that day on no one could say who he had been or what had become of him."
werewolf,22,"The king and his whole retinue now returned to the castle, where the king had a splendid banquet prepared, to which he invited all the able and distinguished people throughout the kingdom, and bestowed his daughter on the young prince. And the wedding was celebrated with gladness and music and amusements of every kind for many days. I was there, too, and when I rode through the forest I met a wolf with two young wolves, and they showed me their teeth and seemed very angry. And I was told they were none other than the evil step-mother and her two daughters."
what-one-can-invent,1,"There was once a young man who was studying to be a poet. He
wanted to become one by Easter, and to marry, and to live by poetry.
To write poems, he knew, only consists in being able to invent
something. But he could not invent anything. He had been born too
late--everything had been taken up before he came into the world,
and everything had been written and told about."
what-one-can-invent,2,"""Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!"" said he. ""It
was an easy matter for them to become immortal. Happy even was he
who was born a hundred years ago, for then there was still something
about which a poem could be written. Now the world is written out, and
what can I write poetry about?"""
what-one-can-invent,3,"Then he studied till he became ill and wretched, the wretched man!
No doctor could help him, but perhaps the wise woman could. She
lived in the little house by the wayside, where the gate is that she
opened for those who rode and drove. But she could do more than unlock
the gate. She was wiser than the doctor who drives in his own carriage
and pays tax for his rank.

""I must go to her,"" said the young man."
what-one-can-invent,4,"The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but dreary to
behold, for there were no flowers near it--no trees. By the door stood
a bee-hive, which was very useful. There was also a little
potato-field, very useful, and an earth bank, with sloe bushes upon
it, which had done blossoming. It now bore fruit, sloes, that draw
one's mouth together if one tastes them before the frost has touched
them."
what-one-can-invent,5,"""That's a true picture of our poetryless time, that I see before
me now,"" thought the young man. That was at least a thought, a
grain of gold that he found by the door of the wise woman.

""Write that down!"" said she. ""Even crumbs are bread. I know why
you come hither. You cannot invent anything, and yet you want to be
a poet by Easter."""
what-one-can-invent,6,"""Everything has been written down,"" said he. ""Our time is not
the old time.""

""No,"" said the woman. ""In the old time wise women were burnt,
and poets went about with empty stomachs, and very much out at elbows.
The present time is good, it is the best of times. But you have not
the right way of looking at it. Your ear is not sharpened to hear, and
I fancy you do not say the Lord's Prayer in the evening. There is
plenty here to write poems about, and to tell of, for any one who
knows the way. You can read it in the fruits of the earth, you can
draw it from the flowing and the standing water. You must
understand how--you must understand how to catch a sunbeam. Now just
you try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet to your ear, and then
pray to God, and leave off thinking of yourself."""
what-one-can-invent,7,"The last was a very difficult thing to do--more than a wise
woman ought to ask.

He received the spectacles and the ear-trumpet, and was posted
in the middle of the potato-field. She put a great potato into his
hand. Sounds came from within it. There came a song with words, the
history of the potato, an every-day story in ten parts, an interesting
story. And ten lines were enough to tell it in."
what-one-can-invent,8,"And what did the potato sing?

She sang of herself and of her family, of the arrival of the
potato in Europe, of the misrepresentation to which she had been
exposed before she was acknowledged, as she is now, to be a greater
treasure than a lump of gold."
what-one-can-invent,9,"""We were distributed, by the King's command, from the
council-houses through the various towns, and proclamation was made of
our great value. But no one believed in it, or even understood how
to plant us. One man dug a hole in the earth and threw in his whole
bushel of potatoes. Another put one potato here and another there in
the ground, and expected that each was to come up a perfect tree, from
which he might shake down potatoes. And they certainly grew, and
produced flowers and green watery fruit, but it all withered away.
Nobody thought of what was in the ground--the blessing--the potato.
Yes, we have endured and suffered, that is to say, our forefathers
have; they and we, it is all one.""

What a story it was!"
what-one-can-invent,10,"""Well, and that will do,"" said the woman. ""Now look at the sloe
bush.""

""We have also some near relations in the home of the potatoes, but
higher towards the north than they grew,"" said the Sloes. ""There
were Northmen, from Norway, who steered westward through mist and
storm to an unknown land, where, behind ice and snow, they found
plants and green meadows, and bushes with blue-black grapes--sloe
bushes. The grapes were ripened by the frost just as we are. And
they called the land 'wine-land,' that is, 'Groenland,' or
'Sloeland.'""

""That is quite a romantic story,"" said the young man.

""Yes, certainly. But now come with me,"" said the wise woman, and
she led him to the bee-hive."
what-one-can-invent,11,"He looked into it. What life and labor! There were bees standing
in all the passages, waving their wings, so that a wholesome draught
of air might blow through the great manufactory. That was their
business. Then there came in bees from without, who had been born with
little baskets on their feet. They brought flower-dust, which was
poured out, sorted, and manufactured into honey and wax. They flew
in and out. The queen-bee wanted to fly out, but then all the other
bees must have gone with her. It was not yet the time for that, but
still she wanted to fly out. So the others bit off her majesty's
wings, and she had to stay where she was."
what-one-can-invent,12,"""Now get upon the earth bank,"" said the wise woman. ""Come and look
out over the highway, where you can see the people.""

""What a crowd it is!"" said the young man. ""One story after
another. It whirls and whirls! It's quite a confusion before my
eyes. I shall go out at the back.""

""No, go straight forward,"" said the woman. ""Go straight into the
crowd of people. Look at them in the right way. Have an ear to hear
and the right heart to feel, and you will soon invent something.
But, before you go away, you must give me my spectacles and my
ear-trumpet again."""
what-one-can-invent,13,"And so saying, she took both from him.

""Now I do not see the smallest thing,"" said the young man, ""and
now I don't hear anything more.""

""Why, then, you can't be a poet by Easter,"" said the wise woman.

""But, by what time can I be one?"" asked he.

""Neither by Easter nor by Whitsuntide! You will not learn how to
invent anything.""

""What must I do to earn my bread by poetry?""

""You can do that before Shrove Tuesday. Hunt the poets! Kill their
writings and thus you will kill them. Don't be put out of countenance.
Strike at them boldly, and you'll have carnival cake, on which you can
support yourself and your wife too.""

""What one can invent!"" cried the young man. And so he hit out
boldly at every second poet, because he could not be a poet himself.

We have it from the wise woman. She knows WHAT ONE CAN INVENT."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,1,"I WILL tell you a story that was told to me when I was a little boy.
Every time I think of this story it seems to me more and more charming;
for it is with stories as it is with many people--they become better as
they grow older."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,2,"I have no doubt that you have been in the country and seen a very old
farmhouse, with thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild
upon it. There is a stork's nest on the ridge of the gable, for we
cannot do without the stork. The walls of the house are sloping, and the
windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open. The baking
oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob. An elder tree hangs over
the palings, and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a
pool of water in which a few ducks are sporting. There is a yard dog,
too, that barks at all comers."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,3,"Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane, and in it dwelt
an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small as their possessions were,
they had one thing they could not do without, and that was a horse,
which contrived to live upon the grass found by the side of the
highroad. The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his
neighbors often borrowed it of him and paid for the loan of it by
rendering some service to the old couple. Yet after a time the old
people thought it would be as well to sell the horse or exchange it for
something which might be more useful to them. But what should this
_something_ be?"
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,4,"""You will know best, old man,"" said the wife. ""It is fair day to-day; so
ride into town and get rid of the horse for money or make a good
exchange. Whichever you do will please me; so ride to the fair."""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,5,"She fastened his neckerchief for him, for she could do that better than
he could and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow. She
also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand and gave
him a kiss. Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold, or
bartered for something else. Yes, the goodman knew what he was about.
The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the
sky. The road was very dusty, for many people, all going to the fair,
were driving, riding, or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere
from the hot sun. Among the crowd a man came trudging along, driving a
cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could
be."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,6,"""She gives good milk, I am certain,"" said the peasant to himself. ""That
would be a very good exchange: the cow for the horse. Halloo there! you
with the cow,"" he said. ""I tell you what, I dare say a horse is of more
value than a cow; but I don't care for that. A cow will be more useful
to me, so if you like we'll exchange.""

""To be sure I will,"" said the man."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,7,"Accordingly the exchange was made. When the matter was settled the
peasant might have turned back, for he had done the business he came
to do. But having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to
do so, if only to have a look at it. So on he went to the town with his
cow. Leading the animal, he strode on sturdily, and, after a short time,
overtook a man who was driving a sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a
fine fleece on its back."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,8,"""I should like to have that fellow,"" said the peasant to himself. ""There
is plenty of grass for him by our palings, and in the winter we could
keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would be more profitable to
have a sheep than a cow. Shall I exchange?""

The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly
made. And then our peasant continued his way on the highroad with his
sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the
road from a field, and was carrying a large goose under his arm."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,9,"""What a heavy creature you have there!"" said the peasant. ""It has plenty
of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well tied to a string, or
paddling in the water at our place. That would be very useful to my old
woman; she could make all sorts of profit out of it. How often she has
said, 'If we only had a goose!' Now here is an opportunity, and, if
possible, I will get it for her. Shall we exchange? I will give you my
sheep for your goose, and thanks into the bargain."""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,10,"The other had not the least objection, and accordingly the exchange was
made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. By this time he had
arrived very near the town. The crowd on the highroad had been gradually
increasing, and there was quite a rush of men and cattle. The cattle
walked on the path and by the palings, and at the turnpike gate they
even walked into the toll keeper's potato field, where one fowl was
strutting about with a string tied to its leg, lest it should take
fright at the crowd and run away and get lost."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,11,"The tail feathers of this
fowl were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very
cunning as it said, ""Cluck, cluck."" What were the thoughts of the fowl
as it said this I cannot tell you, but as soon as our good man saw it,
he thought, ""Why, that's the finest fowl I ever saw in my life; it's
finer than our parson's brood hen, upon my word. I should like to have
that fowl. Fowls can always pick up a few grains that lie about, and
almost keep themselves. I think it would be a good exchange if I could
get it for my goose. Shall we exchange?"" he asked the toll keeper.
""Exchange?"" repeated the man. ""Well, it would not be a bad thing."""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,12,"So they made an exchange; the toll keeper at the turnpike gate kept the
goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl. Now he really had done a
great deal of business on his way to the fair, and he was hot and tired.
He wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; so he
turned his steps to an inn. He was just about to enter, when the ostler
came out, and they met at the door. The ostler was carrying a sack.
""What have you in that sack?"" asked the peasant.

""Rotten apples,"" answered the ostler; ""a whole sackful of them. They
will do to feed the pigs with."""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,13,"""Why, that will be terrible waste,"" the peasant replied. ""I should like
to take them home to my old woman. Last year the old apple tree by the
grassplot bore only one apple, and we kept it in the cupboard till it
was quite withered and rotten. It was property, my old woman said. Here
she would see a great deal of property--a whole sackful. I should like
to show them to her.""

""What will you give me for the sackful?"" asked the ostler.

""What will I give? Well, I will give you my fowl in exchange."""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,14,"So he gave up the fowl and received the apples, which he carried into
the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against the stove, and then
went to the table. But the stove was hot, and he had not thought of
that. Many guests were present--horse-dealers, cattle-drovers, and two
Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich that their pockets bulged and
seemed ready to burst; and they could bet too, as you shall hear.
Hiss--s--s, hiss--s--s. What could that be by the stove? The apples were
beginning to roast. ""What is that?"" asked one."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,15,"""Why, do you know--"" said our peasant, and then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and all the rest of it, down to the apples.

""Well, your old woman will give it to you when you get home,"" said one of the Englishmen. ""Won't there be a noise?""

""What! Give me what?"" said the peasant. ""Why, she will kiss me, and say,
'What the goodman does is always right.'""

""Let us lay a wager on it,"" said the Englishman. ""We'll wager you a ton
of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundredweight.""

""No, a bushel will be enough,"" replied the peasant. ""I can only set a
bushel of apples against it, and I'll throw myself and my old woman into
the bargain. That will pile up the measure, I fancy.""

""Done! taken!"" and so the bet was made."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,16,"Then the landlord's coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen and
the peasant got in, and away they drove. Soon they had stopped at the
peasant's hut. ""Good evening, old woman.""

""Good evening, old man.""

""I've made the exchange.""

""Ah, well, you understand what you're about,"" said the woman. Then she
embraced him, and paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she notice
the sack.

""I got a cow in exchange for the horse.""

""Oh, how delightful!"" said she. ""Now we shall have plenty of milk, and
butter, and cheese on the table. That was a capital exchange.""

""Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep.""

""Ah, better still!"" cried the wife. ""You always think of everything; we
have just enough pasture for a sheep. Ewe's milk and cheese, woolen
jackets and stockings! The cow could not give all these, and her hairs
only fall off. How you think of everything!"""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,17,"""But I changed away the sheep for a goose.""

""Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. You dear old man, you
are always thinking of something to please me. This is delightful. We
can let the goose walk about with a string tied to her leg, so that she
will get fatter still before we roast her.""

""But I gave away the goose for a fowl.""

""A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange,"" replied the woman. ""The fowl
will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have chickens. We shall soon
have a poultry yard. Oh, this is just what I was wishing for!"""
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,18,"""Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shriveled apples.""

""What! I must really give you a kiss for that!"" exclaimed the wife. ""My
dear, good husband, now I'll tell you something. Do you know, almost as
soon as you left me this morning, I began thinking of what I could give
you nice for supper this evening, and then I thought of fried eggs and
bacon, with sweet herbs. I had eggs and bacon but lacked the herbs, so I
went over to the schoolmaster's. I knew they had plenty of herbs, but
the schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I
begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. 'Lend!' she exclaimed, 'I have
nothing to lend. I could not even lend you a shriveled apple, my dear
woman.' But now I can lend her ten, or a whole sackful, for which I'm
very glad. It makes me laugh to think of it."" Then she gave him a hearty
kiss."
what-the-goodman-does-is-always-right,19,"""Well, I like all this,"" said both the Englishmen; ""always going down
the hill and yet always merry. It's worth the money to see it."" So they
paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant who, whatever he did, was
not scolded but kissed.

Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that her
husband knows best and that whatever he does is right.

This is a story which I heard when I was a child. And now you have heard
it, too, and know that ""What the goodman does is always right."""
which-was-the-foolishest,1,"In a little village that stood on a wide plain, where you could see
the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set, there lived two
couples side by side. The men, who worked under the same master, were
quite good friends, but the wives were always quarrelling, and the
subject they quarrelled most about was--which of the two had the
stupidest husband.

Unlike most women--who think that anything that belongs to them must be
better than what belongs to anyone else--each thought her husband the
more foolish of the two."
which-was-the-foolishest,2,"'You should just see what he does!' one said to her neighbour. 'He puts
on the baby's frock upside down, and, one day, I found him trying to
feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after.
Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes,
and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window, because
he declared it was a shorter way than through the door.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,3,"'That is bad enough, of course,' answered the other; 'but it is really
NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband. If, when
I am busy, I ask him to go and feed the poultry, he is certain to give
them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food, and when I visit
the yard next I find them all dead. Once he even took my best bonnet,
when I had gone away to my sick mother, and when I came back I found he
had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in. And you know yourself that,
only last week, when I sent him to buy a cask of butter, he returned
driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take,
and not one of them would lay.'

'Yes, I am afraid he IS trying,' replied the first; 'but let us put them
to the proof, and see which of them is the most foolish.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,4,"So, about the time that she expected her husband home from work, she got
out her spinning-wheel, and sat busily turning it, taking care not even
to look up from her work when the man came in. For some minutes he stood
with his mouth open watching her, and as she still remained silent, he
said at last:

'Have you gone mad, wife, that you sit spinning without anything on the
wheel?'

'YOU may think that there is nothing on it,' answered she, 'but I can
assure you that there is a large skein of wool, so fine that nobody can
see it, which will be woven into a coat for you.'

'Dear me!' he replied, 'what a clever wife I have got! If you had not
told me I should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel
at all. But now I really do seem to see something.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,5,"The woman smiled and was silent, and after spinning busily for an hour
more, she got up from her stoop, and began to weave as fast as she
could. At last she got up, and said to her husband: 'I am too tired to
finish it to-night, so I shall go to bed, and to-morrow I shall only
have the cutting and stitching to do.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,6,"So the next morning she got up early, and after she had cleaned her
house, and fed her chickens, and put everything in its place again, she
bent over the kitchen table, and the sound of her big scissors might
be heard snip! snap! as far as the garden. Her husband could not see
anything to snip at; but then he was so stupid that was not surprising!"
which-was-the-foolishest,7,"After the cutting came the sewing. The woman patted and pinned and fixed
and joined, and then, turning to the man, she said:

'Now it is ready for you to try on.' And she made him take off his coat,
and stand up in front of her, and once more she patted an pinned and
fixed and joined, and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle.

'It does not feel very warm,' observed the man at last, when he had
borne all this patiently for a long time.

'That is because it is so fine,' answered she; 'you do not want it to be
as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,8,"He DID, but was ashamed to say so, and only answered: 'Well, I am sure
it must be beautiful since you say so, and I shall be smarter than
anyone in the whole village. ""What a splendid coat!"" they will exclaim
when they see me. But it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as
mine.'

Meanwhile the other wife was not idle. As soon as her husband entered
she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite
frightened.

'Why do you stare at me so? Is there anything the matter?' asked he.

'Oh! go to bed at once,' she cried; 'you must be very ill indeed to look
like that!'"
which-was-the-foolishest,9,"The man was rather surprised at first, as he felt particularly well that
evening; but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he
had something dreadful the matter with him, and grew quite pale.

'I dare say it would be the best place for me,' he answered, trembling;
and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs, and to help him off with
his clothes.

'If you sleep well during the might there MAY be a chance for you,' said
she, shaking her head, as she tucked him up warmly; 'but if not--' And
of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose.

'How do you feel this morning?' asked the woman, coming in on tip-toe
when her house-work was finished.

'Oh, bad; very bad indeed,' answered he; 'I have not slept for a moment.
Can you think of nothing to make me better?'"
which-was-the-foolishest,10,"'I will try everything that is possible,' said the wife, who did not in
the least wish her husband to die, but was determined to show that he
was more foolish that the other man. 'I will get some dried herbs and
make you a drink, but I am very much afraid that it is too late. Why did
you not tell me before?'

'I thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two; and, besides,
I did not want to make you unhappy,' answered the man, who was by this
time quite sure he had been suffering tortures, and had borne them like
a hero. 'Of course, if I had had any idea how ill I really was, I should
have spoken at once.'

'Well, well, I will see what can be done,' said the wife, 'but talking
is not good for you. Lie still, and keep yourself warm.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,11,"All that day the man lay in bed, and whenever his wife entered the room
and asked him, with a shake of the head, how he felt, he always replied
that he was getting worse. At last, in the evening, she burst into
tears, and when he inquired what was the matter, she sobbed out:

'Oh, my poor, poor husband, are you really dead? I must go to-morrow and
order your coffin.'

Now, when the man heard this, a cold shiver ran through his body, and
all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life.

'Oh, no, no!' he cried, 'I feel quite recovered! Indeed, I think I shall
go out to work.'

'You will do no such thing,' replied his wife. 'Just keep quite quiet,
for before the sun rises you will be a dead man.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,12,"The man was very frightened at her words, and lay absolutely still while
the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin; and his wife gave
orders to the gravedigger about his grave. That evening the coffin was
sent home, and in the morning at nine o'clock the woman put him on a
long flannel garment, and called to the undertaker's men to fasten down
the lid and carry him to the grave, where all their friends were waiting
them. Just as the body was being placed in the ground the other woman's
husband came running up, dressed, as far as anyone could see, in no
clothes at all. Everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of
him, and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too, till their sides
nearly split. The dead man was so astonished at this behaviour, that he
peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin, and cried out:

'I should laugh as loudly as any of you, if I were not a dead man.'"
which-was-the-foolishest,13,"When they heard the voice coming from the coffin the other people
suddenly stopped laughing, and stood as if they had been turned into
stone. Then they rushed with one accord to the coffin, and lifted the
lid so that the man could step out amongst them.

'Were you really not dead after all?' asked they. 'And if not, why did
you let yourself be buried?'"
which-was-the-foolishest,14,"At this the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that
her husband was stupider than the other. But the villagers declared that
they could not decide which was the most foolish--the man who allowed
himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was
dressed in nothing, or the man who let himself be buried when he was
alive and well.

So the women quarrelled just as much as they did before, and no one ever
knew whose husband was the most foolish."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,1,"There was an old man living in the depth of a forest, with his grandson,
whom he had taken in charge when quite an infant. The child had no
parents, brothers, or sisters; they had all been destroyed by six large
giants, and he had been informed that he had no other relative living
beside his grandfather. The band to whom he had belonged had put up
their children on a wager in a race against those of the giants, and had
thus lost them. There was an old tradition in the tribe, that, one day,
it would produce a great man, who would wear a white feather, and who
would astonish every one by his feats of skill and bravery.

The grandfather, as soon as the child could play about, gave him a bow
and arrows to amuse himself with. He went into the edge of the woods one
day, and saw a rabbit; but not knowing what it was, he ran home and
described it to his grandfather. He told him what it was, that its flesh
was good to eat, and that if he would shoot one of his arrows into its
body he would kill it."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,2,"The boy went out again and brought home the
little animal, which he asked his grandfather to boil, that they might
feast on it. He humored the boy in this, and he encouraged him to go on
in acquiring the knowledge of hunting, until he could kill deer and the
larger kinds of game; and he became, as he grew up, an expert hunter.

As they lived alone, and away from other Indians, the curiosity of the
stripling was excited to know what was passing in the world. One day he
came to the edge of a prairie, where he saw ashes like those at his
grandfather's lodge, and lodge-poles left standing."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,3,"He returned, and inquired whether his grandfather had put up the poles
and made the fire. He was answered, No. Nor did he believe that he had
seen any thing of the kind. He must have lost his senses to be talking
of such things.

Another day the young man went out to see what there was, within a day's
hunt, that was curious; and on entering the woods he heard a voice
calling out to him, ""Come here, you destined wearer of the White
Feather. You do not wear it, yet, but you are worthy of it. Return home
and take a short nap. You will dream of hearing a voice, which will tell
you to rise and smoke. You will see in your dream a pipe, a
smoking-sack, and a large white feather. When you awake you will find
these articles. Put the feather on your head, and you will become a
great hunter, a great warrior, and a great man, able to do any thing. As
a proof that these things shall come to pass, when you smoke, the smoke
will turn into pigeons.""

The voice then informed the young man who he was, and made known the
character of his grandfather, who was imposing upon him to serve his own
ends.

The voice-spirit then caused a vine to be laid at his side, and told him
that he was now of an age to avenge the wrongs of his kindred. ""When you
meet your enemy,"" the spirit added, ""you will run a race with him. He
will not see the vine, because it is enchanted. While you are running,
you will throw it over his head and entangle him, so that you will win
the race."""
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,4,"Long before this speech was ended the young man had turned to the
quarter from which the voice proceeded, and he was astonished to behold
a man; for as yet he had never seen any human being beside his
grandfather.

As he looked more keenly, he saw that this man, who had the looks of
great age, was wood from the breast downward, and that he appeared to be
fixed in the earth. As his eye dwelt upon this strange being, the
countenance by degrees faded away, and when he advanced to the spot
whence it had addressed him, it was gone.

He returned home; slept; in the midst of his slumbers, as from the
hollow of the air, heard the voice; wakened and found the promised
gifts. His grandfather, when his attention was called to his awakening,
was greatly surprised to find the youth with a white feather on his
forehead, and to see flocks of pigeons flying out of his lodge. He then
remembered the old tradition, and knowing that now the day when he
should lose control of his charge had begun, he bitterly bewailed the
hour.

Possessed of his three magic gifts, the young man departed the next
morning, to seek his enemies, and to demand revenge."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,5,"The six giants lived in a very high lodge in the middle of a wood. He
traveled on, in good heart, till he reached this lodge, where he found
that his coming had been made known by the little spirits who carry the
news. The giants hastened out, and gave a cry of joy as they saw him
drawing near. When he approached within hail, they began to make sport
of him, saying, ""Here comes the little man with the white feather, who
is to achieve such wonderful wonders.""

When, however, he had arrived among them, they spoke him fair, saying he
was a brave man and would do brave things. Their object was to encourage
him, so that he would be bold to engage in some fool-hardy trial of
strength.

Without paying much heed to their fine speeches, White Feather went
fearlessly into their lodge; and without waiting for invitation, he
challenged them to a foot-match. They agreed; and, as they said, by way
of being easy with him, they told him to begin the race with the
smallest of their number.

The point to which they were to run was a peeled tree toward the rising
sun, and then back to the starting-place, which was a war-club of iron.
Whoever won this stake, was empowered to use it in dispatching the
defeated champion. If White Feather should overcome the first giant, he
was to try the second, and so on, until they had all measured speed with
him. By a dexterous use of the vine, he gained the first race, struck
down his competitor, and cut off his head."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,6,"The next morning he ran with the second giant, whom he also outran,
killed and beheaded.

He went on in this way for the five mornings, always conquering by the
aid of his vine, and lopping off the heads of the vanquished giants.

The last of the giants who was yet to run with him acknowledged his
power, but prepared secretly to deceive him. By way of parley, he
proposed that White Feather should leave the heads with him, and that he
would give him a handsome start for odds. This White Feather declined,
as he preferred to keep the heads as trophies of his victory.

Before going to the giant's lodge, on the sixth morning, he met his old
counselor in the woods, standing rooted in the earth, as before. He told
White Feather that he was about to be deceived; that he had never known
any other sex but his own, but that as he went on his way to the lodge
he would meet the most beautiful woman in the world. He must pay no
attention to her, but as soon as he caught her eye he must wish himself
changed into an elk. The change would take place immediately, and he
must go to feeding and not look at her again.

White Feather thanked his kind adviser, and when he turned to take his
leave he was gone as before."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,7,"He proceeded toward the lodge, met the female as had been foretold to
him, and became an elk. She reproached him that he had cast aside the
form of a man that he might avoid her.

""I have traveled a great distance,"" she added, ""to see you and to become
your wife; for I have heard of your great achievements, and admire you
very much.""

Now this woman was the sixth giant, who had assumed this disguise to
entrap White Feather.

Without a suspicion of her real character, her reproaches and her beauty
affected him so deeply that he wished himself a man again, and he at
once resumed his natural shape. They sat down together, and he began to
caress and to make love to her.

Soothed by her smiles and her gracious manners, he ventured to lay his
head on her lap, and in a little while he fell into a deep slumber.

Even then, such was her fear of White Feather, she doubted whether his
sleep might not be feigned. To assure herself she pushed his head aside,
and seeing that he remained unconscious, she quickly assumed her own
form as the sixth giant, took the plume from the brow of White Feather
and placed it upon his own head, and with a sudden blow of his war-club
changed him into a dog, in which degraded form he followed his enemy to
the lodge."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,8,"While these things were passing, there were living in an Indian village
at some distance, two sisters, the daughters of a chief, who were
rivals, and they were at that very time fasting to acquire power, for
the purpose of enticing the wearer of the white feather to visit their
lodge. They each secretly hoped to engage his affections, and each had
built a lodge in the border of the village encampment.

The giant knowing this, and having become possessed of the magic plume,
went immediately to visit them. As he approached, the sisters, who were
on the look-out at their lodge-doors, espied and recognized the feather.

The eldest sister had prepared her lodge with great show, and all the
finery she could command, so as to attract the eye. The youngest
touched nothing in her lodge, but left it in its ordinary state.

The eldest went out to meet the giant, and invited him in. He accepted
her invitation, and made her his wife. The youngest sister invited the
enchanted dog into her lodge, prepared him a good supper and a neat bed,
and treated him with much attention.

The giant, supposing that whoever possessed the white feather possessed
also all its virtues, went out upon the prairie to hunt, hallooing aloud
to the game to come and be killed; but the great hubbub he kept up
scared them away, and he returned at night with nothing but himself; for
he had shouted so lustily all day long that he had been even obliged to
leave the mighty halloo, with which he had set out, behind."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,9,"The dog went out the same day hunting upon the banks of a river. He
stole quietly along to the spot, and stepping into the water he drew out
a stone, which instantly became a beaver.

The next day the giant followed the dog, and hiding behind a tree, he
watched the manner in which the dog hunted in the river when he drew out
a stone, which at once turned into a beaver.

""Ah, ha!"" said the giant to himself, ""I will catch some beaver for
myself.""

And as soon as the dog had left the place, the giant went to the river,
and, imitating the dog, he drew out a stone, and was delighted to see
it, as soon as it touched the land, change into a fine fat beaver.

Tying it to his belt he hastened home, shouting a good deal, and
brandishing the white feather about, as if he were prepared now to show
them what he could do when he once tried. When he reached home he threw
it down, as is the custom, at the door of the lodge before he entered.

After being seated a short time, he gave a dry cough, and bade his wife
bring in his hunting girdle. She made dispatch to obey him, and
presently returned with the girdle, with nothing tied to it but a stone."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,10,"The next day, the dog finding that his method of catching beavers had
been discovered, went to a wood at some distance, and broke off a
charred limb from a burned tree, which instantly became a bear. The
giant, who appeared to have lost faith in his hulla-balooing, had again
watched him, did exactly as the dog had done, and carried a bear home;
but his wife, when she came to go out for it, found nothing but a black
stick tied to his belt.

And so it happened with every thing. Whatever the dog undertook,
prospered; whatever the giant attempted, failed. Every day the youngest
sister had reason to be more proud of the poor dog she had asked into
her lodge, and every day the eldest sister was made more aware, that
though she had married the white feather, the virtues of the magic
plume were not the personal property of the noisy giant."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,11,"At last the giant's wife determined that she would go to her father and
make known to him what a valuable husband she had, and how he furnished
her lodge with a great abundance of sticks and stones, which he would
pass upon her for bear and beaver. So, when her husband, whose brave
halloo had now died away to a feeble chirp, had started for the hunt,
she set out.

As soon as these two had gone away from the neighborhood, the dog made
signs to his mistress to sweat him after the manner of the Indians. He
had always been a good dog, and she was willing to oblige him. She
accordingly made a lodge just large enough for him to creep in. She then
put in heated stones, and poured water upon them, which raised a vapor
that filled the lodge and searched with its warmth to the very heart's
core of the enchanted dog."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,12,"When this had been kept up for the customary time, the enchanted dog was
completely sweated away, and in his stead, as might have been expected,
out came a very handsome young man, but, unhappily, without the power of
speech. In taking away the dog, it appears that the sweating-lodge had
also carried off the voice with it.

Meantime the elder sister had reached her father's, and, with much
circumstance and a very long face, had told him how that her sister was
supporting an idle dog, and entertaining him as her husband. In her
anxiety to make known her sister's affairs and the great scandal she was
bringing upon the family, the eldest forgot to say any thing of the
sticks and stones which her own husband brought home for bears and
beavers. The old man suspecting that there was magic about her house,
sent a deputation of young men and women to ask his youngest daughter to
come to him, and to bring her dog along with her. When the deputation
reached the lodge, they were surprised to find, in the place of the dog,
a fine young man; and on announcing their message, they all returned to
the old chief, who was no less surprised at the change.

He immediately assembled all the old and wise heads of the nation to
come and be witnesses to the exploits which it was reported that the
young man could perform. The sixth giant, although neither very old nor
very wise, thrust himself in among the relations of the old chief."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,13,"When they were all assembled and seated in a circle, the old chief took
his pipe and filled it, and passed it to the Indians around, to see if
any thing would happen when they smoked. They passed it on until it came
around to the Dog, who made a sign that it should be handed first to the
giant, which was done. And the giant puffed with all his might, and
shook the white feather upon his head, and swelled his chest; but
nothing came of it, except a great deal of smoke. The Dog then took it
himself. He made a sign to them to put the white feather upon his head.
This was no sooner done, than he recovered his speech, and, beginning to
draw upon the pipe at the same moment, behold, immense flocks of white
and blue pigeons rushed from the smoke.

From that moment the sixth giant was looked upon as an impostor, and as
soon as White Feather had, at the request of the company, faithfully
recounted his history, the old chief, who was one of the best-hearted
magicians that ever lived, ordered that the giant should be transformed
into a dog, and turned into the middle of the village, where the boys
should pelt him to death with clubs; which being done, the whole six
giants were at an end, and never troubled that neighborhood again,
forever after.

The chief then gave out a command, at the request of White Feather, that
all the young men should employ themselves four days in making arrows.
White Feather also asked for a buffalo robe. This he cut into thin
shreds, and in the night, when no one knew of it, he went and sowed them
about the prairie in every direction."
white-feather-and-the-six-giants,14,"At the end of the four days, he invited them to gather together all of
their arrows, and to accompany him to a buffalo hunt. When they got out
upon the prairie, they found it covered with a great herd of buffaloes.
Of these they killed as many as they pleased, and, afterward, they had a
grand festival in honor of White Feather's triumph over the giants.

All this being pleasantly over, White Feather got his wife to ask her
father's permission to go with him on a visit to his grandfather. The
old chief replied to this application, that a woman must follow her
husband into whatever quarter of the world he may choose to go.

Bidding farewell to all his friends, White Feather placed the plume in
his frontlet, and taking his war-club in his hand, he led the way into
the forest, followed by his faithful wife."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,1,"Long, long ago, when all the animals could talk, there lived in the province of Inaba in Japan, a little white hare. His home was on the island of Oki. Just across the sea was the mainland of Inaba.

Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba. Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba. Day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across.

One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island.

""This is very lucky!"" thought the hare. ""Now I shall be able to get my wish. I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea!"""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,2,"But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted. So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick.

So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile, and said:

""Oh, Mr. Crocodile, isn't it a lovely day?""

The crocodile, who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright sunshine, was just beginning to feel a bit lonely when the hare's cheerful greeting broke the silence. The crocodile swam nearer the shore, very pleased to hear some one speak."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,3,"""I wonder who it was that spoke to me just now! Was it you, Mr. Hare? You must be very lonely all by yourself!""

""Oh, no, I am not at all lonely,"" said the hare, ""but as it was such a fine day I came out here to enjoy myself. Won't you stop and play with me a little while?""

The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore, and the two played together for some time. Then the hare said:

""Mr. Crocodile, you live in the sea and I live on this island. We do not often meet, so I know very little about you. Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?""

""Of course, there are more crocodiles than hares,"" answered the crocodile. ""Can you not see that for yourself? You live on this small island, while I live in the sea, which spreads through all parts of the world. If I call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us!"" The crocodile was very conceited."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,4,"The hare, who meant to play a trick on the crocodile, said:

""Do you think it possible for you to call up enough crocodiles to form a line from this island across the sea to Inaba?""

The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered:

""Of course, it is possible.""

""Then do try,"" said the crafty hare, ""and I will count the number from here!"""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,5,"The crocodile, who was very simple-minded, and who hadn't the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him, agreed to do what the hare asked. He said:

""Wait a little while I go back into the sea and call my company together!""

The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time. The hare, meanwhile, waited patiently on the shore. At last the crocodile appeared, bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles.

""Look, Mr. Hare!"" said the crocodile, ""it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and Inaba. There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India. Did you ever see so many crocodiles?"""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,6,"Then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of Inaba. When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles, he said:

""How splendid! I did not believe this was possible. Now let me count you all! To do this, however, with your permission, I must walk over on your backs to the other side. Please be so good as not to move, or else I shall fall into the sea and be drowned!""

So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles, counting as he jumped from one crocodile's back to the other:

""Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-""

Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba. Not content with getting his wish, he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them. He said, as he leapt off the last one's back:

""Oh! you stupid crocodiles, now I have done with you!"""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,7,"And he was just about to run away as fast as he could. But he did not escape so easily. So soon as the crocodiles understood that this was a trick played upon them by the hare so as to enable him to cross the sea, and that the hare was now laughing at them for their stupidity, they became furiously angry and made up their minds to take revenge. So some of them ran after the hare and caught him. Then they all surrounded the poor little animal and pulled out all his fur. He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him, but with each tuft of fur they pulled out they said:

""Serve you right!""

When the crocodiles had pulled out the last bit of fur, they threw the poor hare on the beach, and all swam away laughing at what they had done."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,8,"The hare was now in a pitiful plight, all his beautiful white fur had been pulled out. His bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over. He could hardly move. All he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him. Despite that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and suffering upon the white hare of Inaba, any one seeing the poor little creature could not help feeling sorry for him in his sad condition. The crocodiles had been very cruel in their revenge.

Just at this time a number of men, who looked like King's sons, happened to pass by. Seeing the hare lying on the beach crying, they stopped and asked what was the matter.

The hare lifted up his head from between his paws, and answered them, saying:

""I had a fight with some crocodiles, but I was beaten. They pulled out all my fur and left me to suffer here-that is why I am crying."""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,9,"Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition. But he feigned kindness, and said to the hare:

""I feel very sorry for you. If you will only try it, I know of a remedy which will cure your sore body. Go and bathe yourself in the sea, and then come and sit in the wind. This will make your fur grow again, and you will be just as you were before.""

Then all the young men passed on. The hare was very pleased, thinking that he had found a cure. He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him.

But as the wind blew and dried him, his skin became drawn and hardened, and the salt increased the pain so much that he rolled on the sand in his agony and cried aloud."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,10,"Just then another King's son passed by, carrying a great bag on his back. He saw the hare, and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly.

But the poor hare, remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him, did not answer, but continued to cry.

But this man had a kind heart, and looked at the hare very pityingly, and said:

""You poor thing! I see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. Who can have treated you so cruelly?""

When the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man. Encouraged by his gentle manner the hare told him all that had befallen him. The little animal hid nothing from his friend, but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had come across the bridge they had made, thinking that he wished to count their number. He told him how he had jeered at them for their stupidity, and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves on him. Then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend. The hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again."
white-hare-and-crocodiles,11,"When the hare had finished his story, the man was full of pity towards him, and said:

""I am very sorry for all you have suffered, but remember, it was only the consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles.""

""I know,"" answered the sorrowful hare, ""but I have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again. I beg you to show me how I may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again.""

""Then I will tell you of a good remedy,"" said the man. ""First go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body. Then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water. Spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them. If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again, and you will be quite well in a little while."""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,12,"The hare was very glad to be told what to do, so kindly. He crawled to the pond pointed out to him, bathed well in it. He then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water, and rolled himself on them.

To his amazement, even while he was doing this, he saw his nice white fur growing again. The pain ceased, and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes.

The hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery. He went hopping joyfully towards the young man who had so helped him, and kneeling down at his feet, said:

""I cannot express my thanks for all you have done for me! It is my earnest wish to do something for you in return. Please tell me who you are?""

""I am no King's son as you think me. I am a fairy, and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto,"" answered the man. ""Those beings who passed here before me are my brothers. They have heard of a beautiful Princess called Yakami who lives in this province of Inaba, and they are on their way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them. But on this expedition I am only an attendant, so I am walking behind them with this great big bag on my back."""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,13,"The hare humbled himself before this great fairy Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto, whom many in that part of the land worshiped as a god.

""Oh, I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto. How kind you have been to me! It is impossible to believe that that unkind fellow who sent me to bathe in the sea is one of your brothers. I am quite sure that the Princess, whom your brothers have gone to seek, will refuse to be the bride of any of them. She will prefer you for your goodness of heart. I am quite sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so, and she will ask to be your bride."""
white-hare-and-crocodiles,14,"Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto took no notice of what the hare said, but bidding the little animal goodby, went on his way quickly and soon overtook his brothers. He found them just entering the Princess's gate.

Just as the hare had said, the Princess could not be persuaded to become the bride of any of the brothers. But when she looked at the kind brother's face she went straight up to him and said:

""To you I give myself,"" and so they were married.

This is the end of the story. Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto is worshiped by the people in some parts of Japan, as a god, and the hare has become famous as ""The White Hare of Inaba."" But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,1,"In time past--we can not tell exactly how many, many years ago--a poor
Indian was living, with his wife and children, in a beautiful part of
the country. He was not only poor, but he had the misfortune to be
inexpert in procuring food for his family. His children were all too
young to give him assistance.

Although of a lowly condition and straitened in his circumstances, he
was a man of kind and contented disposition. He was always thankful to
the Great Spirit for every thing he received. He even stood in the door
of his lodge to bless the birds that flew past in the summer evenings.
Although, if he had been of a complaining temper, he might have repined
that they were not rather spread upon the table for his evening meal.

The same gracious and sweet disposition was inherited by his eldest son,
who had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the
fast. This was to learn what kind of a spirit would be his guide and guardian
through life.

Wunzh, for this was his name, had been an obedient boy from his
infancy--pensive, thoughtful, and gentle--so that he was beloved by the
whole family."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,2,"As soon as the first buds of spring appeared, and the delicious
fragrance of the young year began to sweeten the air, his father, with
the help of his younger brothers, built for Wunzh the customary little
lodge. It was at a retired spot at some distance from their own, where he would
not be disturbed during the solemn rite.

To prepare himself, Wunzh sought to clear his heart of every evil
thought, and to think of nothing that was not good, and beautiful, and
kindly.

That he might store his mind with pleasant ideas for his dreams, for the
first few days he amused himself by walking in the woods and over the
mountains, examining the early plants and flowers.

As he rambled far and wide, through the wild country, he felt a strong
desire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew, without any
aid from man. He wondered why it was that some kinds were good to eat, and that
others were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power.

After he had become too weak to walk about, and confined himself
strictly to the lodge, he recalled these thoughts, and turning them in
his mind, he wished he could dream of something that would prove a
benefit to his father and family, and to all others of his
fellow-creatures."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,3,"""True,"" thought Wunzh, ""the Great Spirit made all things, and it is to
him that we owe our lives. Could he not make it easier for us to get our
food, than by hunting animals and taking fish? I must try to find this
out in my visions.""

On the third day Wunzh became weak and faint, and kept his bed. Suddenly
he fancied, as he lay thus, that a bright light came in at the lodge
door. Before he was aware, he saw a handsome young man, with a
complexion of the softest and purest white, coming down from the sky,
and advancing toward him.

The beautiful stranger was richly and gayly dressed, having on a great
many garments of green and yellow colors, but differing in their deeper
or lighter shades. He had a plume of waving feathers on his head, and
all his motions were graceful. He reminded Wunzh of the deep green of
the summer grass, and the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle
blowing of the summer wind. Beautiful as the stranger was, he paused on
a little mound of earth, just before the door of the lodge.

""I am sent to you, my friend,"" said this celestial visitor, in a voice
most soft and musical to listen to. ""I am sent to you by that Great
Spirit who made all things in the sky, and on the earth. He has seen and
knows your motives in fasting. He sees that it is from a kind and
benevolent wish to do good to your people, and to procure a benefit for
them. He sees that you do not seek for strength in war, or the praise of the men
of the bloody hand. I am sent to instruct you and to show you how you
can do your kindred good."""
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,4,"He then told the young man to arise, and to prepare to wrestle with him.
It was only by this means that he could hope to succeed in his
wishes.

Wunzh knew how weak he was from fasting, but the voice of the stranger
was cheery, and put such a courage in his heart, that he promptly sprang
up, determined to die rather than fail. Brave Wunzh! if you ever
accomplish any thing, it will be through the power of the resolve that
spoke within you at that moment.

He began the trial, and after a long-sustained struggle he was almost
overpowered, when the beautiful stranger said:

""My friend, it is enough for once, I will come again to try you;"" and
smiling on him, he returned through the air in the same direction in
which he had come.

The next day, although he saw how sweetly the wild-flowers bloomed upon
the slopes, and the birds warbled from the woodland, he longed to see
the celestial visitor, and to hear his voice.

To his great joy he reappeared at the same hour, toward the going down
of the sun, and re-challenged Wunzh to a trial of strength."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,5,"The brave Wunzh felt that his strength of body was even less than on the
day before, but the courage of his mind seemed to grow. Observing this,
and how Wunzh put his whole heart in the struggle, the stranger again
spoke to him in the words he used before, adding:

""To-morrow will be your last trial. Be strong, my friend, for this is
the only way in which you can overcome me and obtain the boon you seek.""

The light which shone after him as he left Wunzh was brighter than
before.

On the third day he came again and renewed the struggle. Very faint in
body was poor Wunzh, but he was stronger at heart than ever, and
determined to prevail now or perish. He put forth his utmost powers, and
after a contest more severe than either of the others, the stranger
ceased his efforts, and declared himself conquered.

For the first time he entered Wunzh's little fasting-lodge. Sitting
down beside the youth, he began to deliver his instructions to him and
to inform him in what manner he should proceed to take advantage of his
victory."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,6,"""You have won your desire of the Great Spirit,"" said the beautiful
stranger. ""You have wrestled manfully. To-morrow will be the seventh day
of your fasting. Your father will give you food to strengthen you, and
as it is the last day of trial you will prevail. I know this, and now
tell you what you must do to benefit your family and your people.
Tomorrow,"" he repeated, ""I shall meet you and wrestle with you for the
last time. As soon as you have prevailed against me, you will strip off
my garments and throw me down, clean the earth of roots and weeds, make
it soft, and bury me in the spot. When you have done this, leave my body
in the earth, and do not disturb it. Come at times to visit the
place, to see whether I have come to life. Above all be careful to
never let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave. Once a month cover me
with fresh earth. If you follow these my instructions you will
accomplish your object of doing good to your fellow-creatures by
teaching them the knowledge I now teach you.""

He then shook Wunzh by the hand and disappeared, but he was gone so soon
that Wunzh could not tell what direction he took."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,7,"In the morning, Wunzh's father came to his lodge with some slight
refreshments, saying:

""My son, you have fasted long enough. If the Great Spirit will favor
you, he will do it now. It is seven days since you have tasted food, and
you must not sacrifice your life. The Master of Life does not require
that.""

""My father,"" replied Wunzh, ""wait till the sun goes down. I have a
particular reason for extending my fast to that hour.""

""Very well,"" said the old man, ""I shall wait till the hour arrives, and
you shall be inclined to eat.""

At his usual hour of appearing, the beautiful sky-visitor returned, and
the trial of strength was renewed. Although he had not availed himself
of his father's offer of food, Wunzh felt that new strength had been
given him. His heart was mighty within him to achieve some great
purpose. Courage was like the eagle that spreads his wings within the
tree-top for a great flight, within the bosom of the brave Wunzh.

He grasped his angel challenger with supernatural strength and threw him
down. Mindful of his own instructions, he tore from him his beautiful
garments and plume. Finding him dead, he immediately buried him on
the spot, using all the precautions he had been told of. Very
confident was Wunzh, all the time, that his friend would again come to
life."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,8,"Wunzh now returned to his father's lodge, where he was warmly welcomed.
As it had been appointed to him during the days of his fasting to
walk apart with Heaven, he was not permitted to see any human face save
that of his father, the representative to the little household upon
earth of the Good Father who is in Heaven.

Wunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had been prepared for him, and
once more mingled in the cares and sports of the family. But he never
for a moment forgot the grave of his friend. He carefully visited it
throughout the spring, and weeded out the grass, and kept the ground in
a soft and pliant state. Sometimes, when the brave Wunzh thought of
his friend that was gone from his sight, he dropped a tear upon the
earth where he lay.

Watching and tending, and moistening the earth with his tears, it was
not long before Wunzh saw the tops of green plumes coming through the
ground. The more faithful he was in obeying his instructions in
keeping the ground in order, and in cherishing the memory of his
departed friend, the faster they grew. He was, however, careful to
conceal the charge of the earth which he had from his father.

Days and weeks had passed in this way. The summer was drawing toward a
close, when one day, after a long absence in hunting, Wunzh invited his
father to follow him to the quiet and lonesome spot of his former fast."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,9,"The little fasting-lodge had been removed, and the weeds kept from
growing on the circle where it had stood. In its place rose a tall
and graceful plant, surmounted with nodding plumes and stately leaves,
and golden clusters. There was in its aspect and bearing the deep green
of the summer grass, the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle
blowing of the summer wind.

""It is my friend!"" shouted Wunzh, ""it is the friend of all mankind. It
is Mondawmin: it is our Indian Corn! We need no longer rely on hunting
alone, for as long as this gift is cherished and taken care of, the
ground itself will give us a living.""

He then pulled an ear."
wunzh-the-father-of-indian-corn,10,"""See, my father,"" said he, ""this is what I fasted for. The Great Spirit
has listened to my voice, and sent us something new, and henceforth our
people will not alone depend upon the chase or upon the waters.""

Wunzh then communicated to his father the instructions given to him by
the stranger. He told him that the broad husks must be torn away, as he
had pulled off the garments in his wrestling. Having done this, he
directed him how the ear must be held before the fire till the outer
skin became brown--as he complexion of his angel friend had been tinted
by the sun--while all the milk was retained in the grain.

The whole family, in high spirits, and deeply grateful to the Merciful
Master who gave it, assisted in a feast on the newly-grown ears of corn.

So came that mighty blessing into the world, and we owe all of those
beautiful fields of healthful grain to the dream of the brave boy Wunzh."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,1,"Once upon a time there was a woman who had a son. He was so lazy and slow that there was not a single blessed useful thing he would do. But
he liked to sing and to dance, and that is what he did all day long, and
far into the night as well. The longer this went on, the worse off his
mother was. The youth was growing, and he wanted so much to eat that it
was barely possible to find it. More and more went for his clothes
the older he grew, since his clothes did not last long, as you may
imagine, because the youth skipped and dance about without stopping,
through forest and field.

At length it was too much for his mother. One day she told the young
fellow that he ought at last to get to work, and really do something, or
both of them would have to starve to death. But the youth had no mind to
do so, he said, and would rather try to win the daughter of the mother
in the corner. If he got her, then he would live happily ever after,
and could sing and dance, and would not have to plague himself with
work."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,2,"When the mother heard that she thought it might not be such a bad idea
after all. She dressed up the youth as well as she could, so that
he would make a good showing when he came to the mother in the corner,
and then he set forth.

When he stepped out the sun was shining bright and warm. It had
rained during the night, and the ground was soft and full of water
puddles. The youth took the shortest path to the mother in the corner,
and sang and danced, as he always did. But suddenly, as he was hopping
and skipping along, he came to a swamp, and there were only some logs
laid down to cross it. From the one log he had to jump over a puddle
to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. And then he
went kerflop! The very moment he set foot on the clump of grass, he went
down and down until he was standing in a dark, ugly hole. At first he
could see nothing at all, but when he had been there a little while, he
saw that there was a rat, who was wiggling and waggling around, and had
a bunch of keys hanging from her tail."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,3,"""Have you come, my boy?"" said the rat. ""I must thank you for coming to
visit me: I have been expecting you for a long time. I am sure you have
come to win me, and I can well imagine that you are in a great hurry.
But you must have a little patience. I am to receive a large dower, and
am not yet ready for the wedding. I will do my best to see that we
are married soon.""

When she had said this, she produced a couple of egg-shells, with all
sorts of eatables such as rats eat. She set them down before the youth,
and said: ""Now you must sit down and help yourself, for I am sure you
are tired and hungry."""
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,4,"The youth had no great appetite for this food. ""If I were only away and
up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing.

""Now I think you must surely want to get home again,"" said the rat. ""I
am well aware that you are waiting impatiently for the wedding, and I
will hurry all I can. Take this linen thread along, and when you get up
above, you must not turn around, but must go straight home, and as you
go you must keep repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" and with
that she laid a linen thread in his hand.

""Heaven be praised!"" said the youth when he was up above once more.
""I'll not go down there again in a hurry."" But he held the thread in his
hand, and danced and sang as usual. And although he no longer had the
rat-hole in mind, he began to hum:

      ""Short before and long behind!
      Short before and long behind!"""
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,5,"When he stood before the door at home, he turned around; and there lay
many, many hundred yards of the finest linen, finer than the most
skillful weaver could have spun.

""Mother, come out, come out!"" called and cried the youth. His mother
came darting out, and asked what was the matter. And when she saw the
linen, stretching as far as she could see, and then a bit, she could
not believe her eyes, until the youth told her how it all happened. But
when she had heard that, and had tested the linen between her fingers,
she was so pleased that she, too, began to sing and dance.

Then she took the linen, cut it, and sewed shirts from it for her son
and herself. The remainder she took to town and sold for a good
price. Then for a time they lived in all joy and comfort. But when that
was over the woman had not a bite to eat in the house. She told
her son that it was the highest time for him to take service, and really
do something, or else both of them would have to starve to death."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,6,"But the youth preferred to go to the mother in the corner, and try to
win her daughter. His mother did not think this such a bad idea, for now
the youth was handsomely dressed, and made a good showing.

So she brushed him, and furbished him up as well as she could. He
himself took a pair of new shoes, and polished them till they shone like
a mirror, and when he had done so, off he went. Everything happened as
before. When he stepped out, the sun was shining bright and warm. It
had rained during the night, and the road was soft and muddy, and every
puddle was full of water. The youth took the shortest way to the mother
in the corner, and sang and danced and danced and sang, as he always
did. He followed another road, not the one he had taken before; but as
he was hopping and skipping along, he suddenly came to the log across
the swamp, and from the log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of
grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. And then he went kerflop.
And he sank down and could not stop, until he reached a horrible, dark,
ugly hole. At first he could see nothing; but after he had stood there a
while, he discovered a rat with a bunch of keys at the end of her tail,
which she was wiggling and waggling in front of him."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,7,"""Have you come, my boy?"" said the rat. ""You are welcome among us! It was kind of you to come and visit me again so soon. No doubt you are very
impatient, I can well imagine it. But you must really be patient a little while longer. My trousseau is not quite complete, but by the time you come again all shall be ready."" When she had said this she offered him egg-shells containing all sorts of food such as rats like. But it looked to the youth like food that had been eaten, and he said that he had no appetite. ""If I were only safely away, and up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing. After a time the rat said: ""Now I think you must surely want to get up above again. I will hurry on the wedding as quickly as I can. And now take this woolen thread along, and when you get up above, you must not turn around, but go straight home, and underway you must keep on repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" and with that she laid the woolen thread in his hand."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,8,"""Thank heaven, I have escaped!"" said the youth to himself. ""I am sure
I'll never go there again,"" and then he sang and danced again as usual.
He thought no more of the rat-hole, but fell to humming, and sang
without stopping:

      ""Short before and long behind!
      Short before and long behind!""

When he stood at the door of the house, he happened to look around.
There lay the finest woolen goods, many hundred yards of it, stretching
for half a mile, and so fine that no city counselor wore a coat of finer
cloth."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,9,"""Mother, mother, come out, come out!"" cried the youth. His mother came
to the door, clasped her hands together over her head, and nearly
fainted with joy when she saw all the fine goods. And then the youth had
to tell her how it had come to him, and all that had taken place, from
beginning to end. This brought them a small fortune, as you may imagine.
The youth had new clothes, and his mother went to town and sold the
goods, yard by yard, and was handsomely paid for them. And then she
decorated her room, and she herself, in her old days, went about in such
style that she might have been taken for some lady of distinction. So
they lived splendidly and happily, but finally this money, too, came to
an end. One day the woman had not a bite to eat left in the house,
and told her son that now he had better look for work, and really do
something, or both of them would starve to death."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,10,"But the youth thought it would be much better to go to the mother in the
corner and try to win her daughter. This time his mother again agreed
with him, and did not contradict the youth. Now he had fine new
clothes, and looked so distinguished that it seemed out of the question
to her that such a good-looking fellow would be refused. So she
furbished him up and tricked him out in the handsomest way, and he
himself took out his new shoes and polished them so brightly that you
could see yourself in them, and when he had done so he set forth.

This time he did not choose the shortest road. He took a roundabout
way, the longest he could find, for he did not want to go down to the
rat again because he was sick of her eternal wiggling and waggling, and
the talk about marriage. The weather and the road were exactly the same
as when he had gone before. The sun shone, the swamp and the puddles
gleamed, and the youth sang and danced as usual. And in the midst of his
skipping and jumping, before he knew it, there he stood at the same
crossing which led across the swamp. There he had to jump over a puddle
to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his brightly polished
shoes. ""Kerflop!"" and down he went, and did not stop until he stood once
more in the same dark, ugly, dirty hole. At first he was pleased because
he could see nothing. But after he had stood there a while, he once more
discovered the ugly rat who was so repulsive to him, with the bunch of
keys hanging from her tail."
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,11,"""Good-day, my boy,"" said the rat. ""You are welcome! I see that you can
no longer live without me, and I thank you. And now everything is in
readiness for our wedding, and we will go straight to church."" Nothing
will come of that, thought the youth, but he did not say a word. Then
the rat whistled, and at once every corner was alive with swarms of mice
and small rats, and six large rats came dragging along a frying-pan. Two
mice sat up behind as grooms, and two sprang up in front to drive the
coach. Several seated themselves within, and the rat with the bunch of
keys took her place in their midst. To the youth she said: ""The road
is a little narrow here, so you will have to walk beside the coach,
sweetheart, until the road is broader. And then you may sit beside me in
the coach.""

""How fine that will be!"" thought the youth. ""If I were only safely up
above once more, I would run away from the whole pack of them,"" thought
he, but he said nothing. He went along with the procession as well as he
could. At times he had to crawl, at others he had to stoop, for the way
was very narrow. But when it grew better, he walked in advance, and
looked about to see how he might most easily steal away and make off.
And then he suddenly heard a clear, beautiful voice behind him say: ""Now
the road is good! Come, sweetheart, and get into the coach!"""
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,12,"The youth turned around quickly, and was so astonished that his nose and
ears nearly fell off. There stood a magnificent coach with six white
horses, and in the coach sat a maiden as fair and beautiful as the sun,
and about her were sitting others, as bright and kindly as the stars. It
was a princess and her playmates, who had all been enchanted together.
But now they were delivered, because he had come down to them, and had never contradicted.

""Come along now!"" said the princess. Then the youth got into the coach,
and drove to church with her. And when they drove away from the church,
the princess said: ""Now we will first drive to my home, and then we will
send for your mother."""
youth-who-wanted-to-win-daughter-of-mother-in-corner,13,"""That's all very fine,"" thought the youth--he said nothing, but he
thought it would be better, after all, to drive to his home, instead of
down into the hideous rat-hole. But suddenly they came to a beautiful
castle, and there they turned in, for there it was they were to live.
And at once a fine coach with six horses was sent for the youth's
mother, and when she came the wedding festivities began. They celebrated for fourteen days, and perhaps they are celebrating yet. We must hurry, and perhaps we may still get there in time, and can drink the groom's health and dance with the bride!"
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,1,"Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had only one son; but one who
was so lazy and clumsy that he did not want to do a stroke of work. ""If
I am not to feed this bean-pole for the rest of my life, I'll have to
send him far away, where not a soul knows him,"" thought the father.
""Once he is knocking about in the world, he will not be so likely to
come home again."" So he took his son and led him about in the world, far
and wide, and tried to get him taken on as a serving man; but no one
would have him. Finally, after wandering a long time, they came to a
rich man, of whom it was said that he turned every shilling around seven
times before he could make up his mind to part with it. He was willing
to take the youth for a servant, and he was to work three years without
pay. But at the end of the three years, his master was to go into town,
two days in succession, and buy the first thing he saw, and on the third
morning the youth himself was to go to town and also buy the first thing
he met. And all this he was to receive in lieu of his wage."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,2,"So the youth served out his three years, and did better than they had
expected him to do. He was by no means a model serving-man; but then
his master was none of the best, either, for he let him go all that time
in the same clothes he had worn when he entered his service, until,
finally, one patch elbowed the other.

Now when his master was to go to do his buying, he set out as early as
possible in the morning. ""Costly wares are only to be seen by day,"" said
he, ""they are not drifting about the street so early. It will probably
cost me enough as it is, for what I find is a matter of purest chance.""
The first thing he saw on the street was an old woman, who was carrying
a covered basket. ""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ""And good-day to
you, daddy,"" said the old woman."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,3,"""What have you in your basket?"" asked the man. ""Would you like to know?""
said the woman. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""for I have to buy the first thing
that comes my way."" ""Well, if you want to know, buy it!"" said the old
woman. ""What does it cost?"" asked the man. She must have four shillings
for it, declared the woman. This did not seem such a tremendous price to
him, he would let it go at that, said he, and raised the cover. And
there lay a pup in the basket. When the man got home from his journey to
town, there stood the youth full of impatience and curiosity, wondering
what his wage for the first year might be. ""Are you back already,
master?"" asked the youth. ""Yes, indeed,"" said his master. ""And what have
you bought?"" asked the youth. ""What I have bought is nothing so very
rare,"" said the man. ""I don't even know whether I ought to show it to
you; but I bought the first thing to be had, and that was a pup,"" said
he. ""And I thank you most kindly for it,"" said the youth. ""I have always
been fond of dogs."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,4,"The following morning it was no better. The man set out as early as
possible, and had not as yet reached town before he met the old woman
with the basket. ""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ""And good-day to you,
daddy,"" said the old woman. ""What have you in your basket to-day?"" asked
the man. ""If you want to know, then buy it!"" was again the answer. ""What
does it cost?"" asked the man. She wanted four shillings for it, she had
only the one price. The man said he would buy it, for he thought that
this time he would make a better purchase. He raised the cover, and this
time a kitten lay in the basket. When he reached home, there stood the
youth, waiting to see what he was to get in lieu of his second year's
wages. ""Are you back again, master!"" said he. ""Yes, indeed,"" said the
master. ""What did you buy to-day?"" asked the youth. ""Alas, nothing
better than I did yesterday,"" said the man, ""but I did as we agreed, and
bought the first thing I came across, and that was this kitten."" ""You
could not have hit on anything better,"" said the youth, ""for all my life
long I have been fond of cats as well as of dogs."" ""I do not fare so
badly this way,"" thought the man, ""but when he sets out for himself,
then the matter will probably turn out differently."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,5,"So the third morning the youth set out for himself, and when he entered
town, he came across the same old woman with her basket on her arm.
""Good morning, granny,"" said he. ""And good morning to you, my boy,"" said
the old woman. ""What have you in your basket?"" asked the youth. ""If you
want to know, then buy it!"" answered the old woman. ""Do you want to sell
it?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed, and it would cost four shillings,
said the old woman. That is a bargain, thought the youth, and wanted to
take it, for he had to buy the first thing that came his way. ""Well, you
can take the whole blessed lot,"" said the old woman, ""the basket and all
that's in it. But do not look into it before you get home, do you hear!"""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,6,"No, indeed, he would be sure not to look in the basket, said he. But on
the way, he kept wondering as to what might be in the basket, and
willy-nilly--he could not keep from raising the cover a little, and
looking through the crack. But that very minute a little lizard popped
out of the crack, and ran across the road so quickly that it fairly
hummed--and aside from the lizard there was nothing in the basket.
""Stop, wait a minute, and don't run away! I just bought you,"" said the
youth. ""Stab me in the neck! Stab me in the neck!"" cried the lizard. The
youth did not have to be told twice. He ran after the lizard and stabbed
it in the neck just as it was slipping into a hole in a wall. And that
very moment it turned into a man, as handsome and splendid as the
handsomest prince, and a prince he was, if truth be told."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,7,"""Now you have delivered me,"" said he, ""for the old woman, with whom you
and your master have been dealing, is a witch, and she turned me into a
lizard, and my brother and sister into a dog and cat."" The youth thought
this a remarkable tale. ""Yes, indeed,"" said the prince. ""She was
actually on the way to throw us into the sea and drown us; but if any
one were to appear and want to buy us, she had to sell us for four
shillings apiece, that had been agreed upon. And now you shall go home
with me to my father, and be rewarded for your good deed."" ""Your home
must be a good way off,"" said the youth. ""O, it is not so far,"" declared
the prince, ""there it is!"" And he pointed to a high hill in the
distance."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,8,"They marched along as fast as they could, but still it was farther away
than it seemed. So it was late at night before they reached their goal.
The prince knocked. ""Who is knocking at my door, and disturbing my
sleep?"" came a voice within the hill. And the voice was so powerful that
the earth trembled. ""Open, father, your son has come home!"" cried the
prince. Then the father was glad to open the door quickly. ""I thought
you were already lying at the bottom of the sea,"" said the old man.
""But you are not alone?"" ""This is the chap who delivered me,"" said the
prince, ""and I asked him to come with me so that you could reward him.""
That he would attend to, said the old man. ""Now you must come right in,""
said he, ""for here you may rest in safety."" They went in and sat down,
and the old man laid an armful of wood and a couple of big logs on the
fire, until every corner was as bright as day, and wherever they looked
everything was indescribably splendid. The youth had never seen anything
like it, and such fine things to eat and drink as the old man served up
to him, he had never yet tasted. And the bowls and dishes, and goblets
and plates, were all of pure silver and shining gold."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,9,"There was no need to urge the young folk. They ate and drank and enjoyed
themselves, and then slept far into the next day. The youth was still
asleep when the old man came and offered him a morning draft in a golden
goblet. And when he had put on his rags and breakfasted, he was allowed
to pick out what he wanted, as a reward for delivering the prince. There
was much to see and still more to take, as you may believe. ""Well, what
do you want?"" asked the king. ""You may take what you will; for as you
see there is enough from which to choose."" The youth said he would have
to think it over a bit, and speak to the prince. And that he was allowed
to do."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,10,"""Well, I suppose you have seen all sorts of beautiful things?""
asked the prince. ""That is a fact,"" said the youth. ""But tell me, what
ought I to choose among all these magnificent things? Your father said I
might pick out whatever I wished."" ""You must choose none among all the
things you have seen,"" answered the prince, ""but my father wears a ring
on his little finger, and you must ask him for that."" This the youth
did, and begged the king for the ring on his finger. ""It is dearer to
me than anything else I have,"" said the king, ""but my son is just as
dear to me, and therefore I will give you the ring. Do you know what
powers it has?"" No, that the youth did not know. ""While you wear it on
your finger, you can get everything that you want to have,"" said the
king. The youth thanked him most kindly, and the king and the prince
wished him all manner of luck on his journey, and charged him to take
the best care of the ring."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,11,"He had not been long underway before it occurred to him to test what the
ring could do. So he wished to be dressed in new clothes from head to
toe, and no more had he uttered the wish than there he was in them. And
he looked as handsome and bright as a new nickel. Then he thought to
himself it would be pleasant to play a trick on his father. ""He was none
too friendly to me while I was still at home."" And so the youth wished
he were standing before his father's door, just as ragged as he had been
before. And that very minute there he stood.

""Good-day, father, and many thanks for the last time!"" said the youth.
But when his father saw he had come home far more tattered and torn than
when he had gone away, he grew angry and began to scold: ""There is
nothing to be made of you, if during all the long years of your service
you have not even been able to earn a suit of clothes to your back."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,12,"""Now do not be so angry, father,"" said the youth. ""You need not take for
granted that a fellow is a vagabond because he goes about in rags. Now
I want you to go to the king as my proxy, and ask his daughter's hand
for me."" ""Come, come, why, that is utter folly and nonsense!"" cried his
father. But the youth insisted that it was gospel truth, and took a
birch bough, and drove his father to the king's castle-gate. And the
latter came stumbling right in to the king, and wept so that the tears
just tumbled out.

""Well, what has happened to you, my dear fellow?"" asked the king. ""If a
wrong has been done you, I will see that you get your rights."" No, no
wrong had been done him, said the man, but he had a son who gave him a
great deal of trouble: it was impossible to make a man of him, and now
he had evidently lost what few senses he did possess. ""Because he has
just chased me to the castle-gate with a birch bough, and threatened me,
if I do not get him the king's daughter for a bride,"" said the man. ""Set
your mind at rest, my good fellow,"" said the king, ""and send your son to
me. Then we will see whether we can come to an understanding."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,13,"The youth came rushing in to the king, so that his rags fairly
fluttered. ""Do I get your daughter?"" he cried. ""Well, that is just what
we are going to discuss,"" said the king, ""perhaps she would not answer
for you, and perhaps you would not answer for her,"" said he. That might
be the case, said the youth.

Now a great ship from abroad had shortly before come into port, and one
could see it from the castle window. ""Now we'll see,"" said the king. ""If
you can build a ship that is the exact counterpart of the one outside,
and just as handsome, in the space of an hour or two, then, perhaps, you
may get my daughter,"" said the king."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,14,"""If it be no more than that ..."" said the youth. Then he went down to
the shore and sat on a sand-pile, and when he had sat there long enough,
he wished that a ship might lie out in the fjord, completely equipped
with masts and sails and all that goes with them, and that it might
resemble the ship already lying there in every particular. And that very
minute there lay the ship, and when the king saw that there were two
ships at anchor instead of one, he came down to the shore himself to
look more closely into the matter. And then he saw the youth. He was
standing in a boat, with a broom in one hand, as though he meant to give
the ship a final cleaning; but when he saw the king coming, he threw
away the broom and cried: ""Now the ship is finished. Do I get your
daughter now?""

""That is all very fine,"" said the king, ""but you must stand yet another
test. If you can build a castle that is just like mine in every
particular within an hour or so, then we will go further into the
matter."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,15,"""No more than that?"" cried the youth. After he had strolled around for a
long while, and the time set was nearly over, he wished that a castle
might stand there that resembled the king's castle in every particular.
And before long there it stood, as you may believe. And it did not
take long, either, before the king, together with the queen and the
princess, came to look at the new castle. The youth stood there with his
broom again, and swept and cleaned. ""Now the castle is in apple-pie
order. Do I get her now?"" he cried."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,16,"""That's all very fine,"" declared the king, ""just come in and we'll talk
it over,"" said he, for he had noticed that the youth knew a thing or
two, and he was thinking over how he might get rid of him. The king went
on ahead, and after him the queen, and then went the princess, just in
advance of the youth. Then he at once wished to be the handsomest man in
the world, and so he was, that very minute. When the princess saw what
a splendid figure he suddenly cut, she nudged the queen, who in turn
nudged the king, and after they had stared at him long enough, they at
last realized that the youth was more than he had at first appeared to
be, in his rags. So they decided that the princess was to treat him
nicely, in order to find out how matters really stood, and the princess
was as sweet and amiable as sugar-bread, and flattered the youth, and
said that she could not do without him, night or day. And when it came
toward the end of the first evening, she said: ""Since you and I are to
be married in any case, I am sure you will have no secrets from me, and
you will not want to hide from me how you managed to do all these fine
things."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,17,"""O, yes,"" said the youth. ""You shall know about it, but first of all let
us be married; before that nothing counts!""

The following evening the princess pretended to be quite unhappy. She
was well aware, said she, that he did not attach much importance to her
love, when he would not even tell her what she wanted so much to know.
If he could not even oblige her in such a small matter, his love could
not amount to a great deal. Then the youth fell into despair, and to
make up with her again, he told her everything. She lost no time, and
let the king and queen know all about it. Thereupon they agreed as to
how they would go about getting the youth's ring away from him, and
then, thought they, it would not really be hard to get rid of him."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,18,"In the evening the princess came with a sleeping potion, and said she
wanted to give her lover a drink that would increase his love for her,
since it was plain he did not love her enough. The youth suspected
nothing, and drank, and at once fell so fast asleep that they could have
pulled down the house over his head. Then the princess drew the ring
from his finger, put it on herself, and wished the youth might be lying
on the garbage-pile in the street, just as tattered and torn as he had
come to them, and in his place she wanted the handsomest prince in the
world. And that very minute everything happened just as she wished.
After a time the youth woke up, out on the garbage-pile, and at
first thought he was dreaming: but when he saw the ring was gone, he
understood how it all had happened, and fell into such despair that he
got up and wanted to jump right into the sea.

But then he met the cat his master had bought for him. ""Where are you
going?"" she asked. ""To throw myself into the sea and drown,"" was the
youth's reply."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,19,"""Do not do so on any account,"" said the cat. ""You will get your ring
again.""

""Yes, if that were so, then ..."" said the youth.

The cat ran away. Suddenly a rat crossed her path. ""Now I will pounce on
you!"" said the cat. ""O do not do that,"" said the rat, ""you shall have
the ring again!""

""Well, if that is so, then ..."" said the cat.

When the folk at the castle had gone to bed, the rat crept around, and
sniffed and spied out the room of the prince and princess; and at last
he found a little hole through which he crawled. Then he heard the
prince and princess talking to each other, and saw that the prince was
wearing the ring on his finger. Before she went, the princess said:
""Good night. And see that you take good care of the ring, my dearest!""

""Pooh! no one will come in through the walls for the sake of a ring,""
said the prince, ""but if you think it is not safe enough on my hand,
why, I can put it in my mouth."""
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,20,"After a time he lay down on his back, and prepared to go to sleep. But
just then the ring slipped down his throat, and he had to cough, so
that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground. Swish!--the rat had
caught it, and crept out with it to the cat, who was waiting at the
rat-hole. But in the meantime the king had caught the youth, and had had
him put in a great tower and condemned to death, because he had made a
mock of his daughter--so the king said. And the youth was to sit in the
tower until he was beheaded. But the cat kept prowling around the tower
all the time, trying to sneak in with the ring. And then an eagle came
along, caught her up in his claws and flew across the sea with her. And
suddenly a hawk appeared, and flung himself on the eagle, and the eagle
let the cat fall into the sea. When she felt the water, she grew afraid,
let the ring fall, and swam to land. No sooner had she shaken the water
from her fur than she met the dog whom the youth's master had bought for
him.

""Well, what am I to do now?"" said the cat, and wept and lamented. ""The
ring is gone, and they want to murder the youth."" ""That I do not know,""
said the dog, ""but what I do know is that I have the very worst kind of
an ache in my stomach,"" said he."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,21,"""There you have it. You have surely over-eaten,"" said the cat.

""I never eat more than I need,"" said the dog, ""and just now I have eaten
nothing at all, save a dead fish that was left here by the ebb-tide.""

""Could the fish have swallowed the ring?"" asked the cat. ""And must you,
also, lose your life, because you cannot digest gold?""

""That may well be the case,"" said the dog. ""But then it would be best
if I died at once, for then the youth might still be saved.""

""O, that is not necessary!"" said the rat--who was there, too--""I do not
need a very large opening through which to crawl, and if the ring is
really there, I am sure I can find it."" So the rat slipped down into the
dog, and before very long he came out again with the ring. And then the
cat made her way to the tower, and clawed her way up till she found a
hole through which she could thrust her paw, and thus brought back the
ring to the youth."
youth-who-was-to-serve-three-years-without-pay,22,"No sooner was it on his finger than he wished that the tower might break
down, and that very moment he was standing just before the tower-gate,
and reviling the king and the queen and the king's daughter as though
they were the lowest of the low. The king hastily called together his
army, and told it to surround the tower, and take the youth prisoner,
dead or alive. But the youth only wished the whole army might be
sticking up to their necks in the big swamp in the hills, and there they
had trouble enough getting out--those among them who did not stick fast.
Then he went right on reviling where he had stopped, and finally, when
he had told them all just what he thought of them, he wished that the
king, the queen and the king's daughter might sit for the rest of their
lives in the tower into which they had thrust him. And when they were
sitting there, he took possession of the king's land and country on his
own account. Then the dog changed into a prince, and the cat into a
princess, and he made the latter his wife, and they were married and
celebrated their wedding long and profusely."
yuletide-specters,1,"Once upon a time there lived two peasants on a homestead called Vaderas, just as there are two peasants living on it now. In those days the roads were good, and the women were in the habit of riding when they wanted to go to church."
yuletide-specters,2,"One Christmas the two women agreed that they would ride to Christmas night mass, and whichever one of them woke up at the right time was to call the other, for in those days there was no such thing as a watch. It was about midnight when one of the women thought she heard a voice from the window, calling: ""I am going to set out now."" She got up hurriedly and dressed herself, so that she might be able to ride with the other woman; but since there was no time to eat, she took a piece of bread from the table along with her. In those times it was customary to bake the bread in the shape of a cross. It was a piece of this kind that the woman took and put in her pocket, in order to eat it underway. She rode as fast as she could, to catch up with her friend, but could not overtake her."
yuletide-specters,3,"The way led over a little stream which flows into Vidostern Lake, and across the stream was a bridge, known as the Earth Bridge, and on the bridge stood two witch trolls, busy washing. As the woman came riding across the bridge, one of the witch trolls called out to the other, ""Hurry, and tear her head from her shoulders!"""
yuletide-specters,4,"""That I cannot do"" returned the other, ""because she has a bit of bread in the form of a cross in her pocket.""

The woman, who had been unable to catch up with her neighbor, reached the church at Hanger alone."
yuletide-specters,5,"The church was full of lights, as was always the case when the Christmas mass was said. As quickly as ever she could the woman tied up her horse, and hurriedly entered the church. It seemed to her that the church was crowded with people; but all of them were headless, and at the altar stood the priest, in full canonicals but without a head. In her haste she did not at once see how things were; but sat down in her accustomed place. As she sat down it seemed to her that some one said: ""If I had not stood godfather to you when you were christened, I would do away with you as you sit there, and now hurry and make yourself scarce, or it will be the worse for you!"" Then she realized that things were not as they should be, and ran out hastily."
yuletide-specters,6,"When she came into the church-yard, it seemed to her as though she were surrounded by a great crowd of people. In those days people wore broad mantles of unbleached wool, woven at home, and white in color. She was wearing one of these mantles and the specters seized it. But she flung it away from her and managed to escape from the church-yard, and run to the poor-house and wake the people there. It is said it was then one o'clock at night."
yuletide-specters,7,"So she sat and waited for the early mass at four o'clock in the morning. And when day finally dawned, they found a little piece of her mantle on every grave in the church-yard."
yuletide-specters,8,"A similar experience befell a man and his wife who lived in a hut known as Ingas, below Mosled. They were no more than an hour ahead of time; but when they reached the church at Hanger, they thought the service had already begun, and wanted to enter at once; but the church was barred and bolted, and the phantom service of the dead was nearing its end. And when the actual mass began, there was found lying at every place some of the earth from the graves of those who shortly before had been worshiping. The man and his wife thereupon fell grievously ill, because they had disturbed the dead."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,1,"There was once upon a time a King who had a wife with golden hair,
and she was so beautiful that you couldn't find anyone like her in the
world. It happened that she fell ill, and when she felt that she must
soon die, she sent for the King, and said, 'If you want to marry after
my death, make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as I am, and
has just such golden hair as I have. Promise me this.' After the King
had promised her this, she closed her eyes and died.

For a long time the King was not to be comforted, and he did not even
think of taking a second wife. At last his councillors said, 'The King
must marry again, so that we may have a queen.' So messengers were
sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late Queen in beauty.
But there was no one in the wide world, and if there had been she could
not have had such golden hair. Then the messengers came home again, not
having been able to find a queen."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,2,"Now, the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead
mother, and had just such golden hair. One day when she had grown up,
her father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother,
so he said to his councillors, 'I will marry my daughter to one of you,
and she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and
when I die her husband shall be king.' But when the Princess heard of
her father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him,
'Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; one as golden as
the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,3,"Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of
skin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.'
But she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall
not have to marry someone I do not care for.' The King, however, was not
to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens
in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and
one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave
orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the
kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand
pieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak
to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and
said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw
that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she
determined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping,
she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a
little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and
star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made
her face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God,
and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large
forest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree
and fell asleep."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,4,"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon.
Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting
in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and
round it, barking. The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a
wild beast is in there.' The huntsmen went in, and then came back and
said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't
know, and we have never seen one like it; its skin is made of a thousand
pieces of fur; but it is lying down asleep.' The King said, 'See if you
can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take
it with us.' When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was
frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by
father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.' Then they
said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come
with us and sweep the ashes together.' So they put her in the cart and
they went back to the palace. There they showed her a tiny room under
the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred
Creature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the
kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed
vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty
work.

So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty. Ah,
beautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now?"
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,5,"It happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace, that
she said to the cook, 'Can I go upstairs for a little bit and look on?
I will stand outside the doors.' The cook replied, 'Yes, you can go up,
but in half-an-hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes.' Then
she took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off
her fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that
her beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were
coming out of a black cloud. Then she opened the nut, and took out the
dress as golden as the sun. And when she had done this, she went up to
the feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and
they thought she must be a King's daughter. But the King came towards
her and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My
eyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' When the dance was ended, she
curtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared,
no one knew whither. The guards who were standing before the palace were
called and questioned, but no one had seen her."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,6,"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made
her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the
Many-furred Creature. When she came into the kitchen and was setting
about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her,
'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; I
want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; but be sure that you
do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in
future!' So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the
soup for the King. She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could,
and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room,
and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,7,"When the dance was ended, the King had his soup brought to him and ate
it, and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in
his life. But when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring
lying there, and he could not imagine how it got in. Then he commanded
the cook to be brought before him. The cook was terrified when he heard
the command, and said to the Many-furred Creature, 'You must have let
a hair fall into the soup, and if you have you deserve a good beating!'
When he came before the King, the King asked who had cooked the soup.
The cook answered, 'I cooked it.' But the King said, 'That's not true,
for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever
cooked.' Then the cook said, 'I must confess; I did not cook the soup;
the Many-furred Creature did.' 'Let her be brought before me,' said the
King."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,8,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she
was. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,
'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots
thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he
asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King
could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.

After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature
begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He
answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King
the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little
room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver
as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a
King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her
again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,9,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King
could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed
herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the
kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched
the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was
poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as
much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had
to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the
Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she
was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew
nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.

When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out
quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch,
Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that
it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.'
But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. Now
she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall
in it."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,10,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had
never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring
on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance
should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep
her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away
among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast
as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had
stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the
beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste
she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining
white."
alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature,11,"The Many-furred Creature now ran into the kitchen, cooked the
King's bread-soup, and when the cook had gone, she laid the gold reel
in the dish. When the King found the reel at the bottom, he had the
Many-furred Creature brought to him, and then he saw the white finger,
and the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance. Then he took her
hand and held her tightly, and as she was trying to get away, she undid
the fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out. The King seized
the cloak and tore it off her. Her golden hair came down, and she stood
there in her full splendour, and could not hide herself away any more.
And when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked
more beautiful than anyone in the world. But the King said, 'You are
my dear bride, and we will never be separated from one another.' So the
wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after."
four-shilling-piece,1,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far
away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and
leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a
cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch
to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for
the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he
crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O,
you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing
terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the
stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked
him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his
shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite
white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You
fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it
had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes
cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out
in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his
jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had
raised itself from the ground on one side."
four-shilling-piece,2,"""Yes, and I'm sure it is because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy. But when he looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under the stone. ""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one
lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" And he took the
chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole
pile of money. But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
of the water. ""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will
float,"" said the boy. And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket
home with him. He told his mother what had happened to him, that the
stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver
coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ""But
a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was
honest,"" said the boy. ""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as
angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the
water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if
the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and
charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and
will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you
any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
four-shilling-piece,3,"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far
and near looking for service. But wherever he went people found him too
small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. At last
he came to a merchant. There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and
he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. When he had been there for
some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked
all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them.
After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little
fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. He handed him his
four-shilling piece. ""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the
merchant. ""It will not be a large purchase."" ""Buy whatever it will
bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. His master
promised to do so, and sailed away."
four-shilling-piece,4,"Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had
reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to
his ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did he remember
that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to
buy him something. ""Must I go up to the city again because of this
four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with
such truck,"" thought the merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on
her back. ""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant. ""O,
it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her
into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ""The boy
told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said
the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her
cat for four shillings. The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain
was closed."
four-shilling-piece,5,"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke
loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and
did not know where or whither. At last he came to a land where he had
never yet been, and went up into the city.

In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay
a switch, one for each guest. This seemed strange to the merchant, for
he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. Yet
he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the
rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" Yes, and when the food
came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place
was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table
had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and
nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than
the other. Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they
had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
four-shilling-piece,6,"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ""How is it
the folk here have no cats?"" ""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know
what they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the
scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to
hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been
able to eat in such comfort. Then they begged and implored the merchant
to sell them his cat. At last he said he would let them have her; but he
wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him
kindly into the bargain."
four-shilling-piece,7,"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas
than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. And immediately
after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and
he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet
been. Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was
covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the
place where he had first been. And they were much needed; for there were
a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had
first seen."
four-shilling-piece,8,"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred
dollars for her, and that without any haggling. But when he had sailed
off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. And the
storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in
which he had never been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the
table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a
half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that
they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for
there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. Only with toil and trouble
could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a
while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. Then the cat
was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace.
They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a
long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her
for three hundred dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him, and
blessed him into the bargain."
four-shilling-piece,9,"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the
boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ""Well, he
shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not
all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,
and charity begins at home.""

But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than
the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey
home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness.
And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe
that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
fox-and-wolf,1,"At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west. The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church. In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset.

One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner."
fox-and-wolf,2,"'I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den,' he said to himself; 'it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure! Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was! If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind. Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: 'One wolf does not bite another.' However, let us see what this village can produce. I am as hungry as a schoolmaster.'

Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road."
fox-and-wolf,3,"'The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer,' murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground. 'When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music. As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food.' And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans. At this moment the wolf came up."
fox-and-wolf,4,"At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was. The fox's quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely:

'Is that you, neighbour? What a strange place to meet in! I hope you are quite well?'

'Quite well as regards my health,' answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, 'at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry. But what is the matter with you? A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!'

'I have been ill-very ill,' replied the fox, 'and what you say is quite true. A worm is fat in comparison with me.'"
fox-and-wolf,5,"He is. Still, you are good enough for me; for 'to the hungry no bread is hard.'

'Oh, you are always joking! I'm sure you are not half as hungry as I!'

'That we shall soon see,' cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring.

'What are you doing?' exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards.

'What am I doing? What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow.'

'Well, I suppose you must have your joke,' answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth:

'I don't want to joke, but to eat!'

'But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!'

'In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest,' replied the wolf.

'Ah! how true that is; but-'

'I can't stop to listen to your 'buts' and 'yets,' broke in the wolf rudely; 'let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you.'

'Have you no pity for a poor mother?' asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same."
fox-and-wolf,6,"'I am dying of hunger,' answered the wolf, doggedly; 'and you know,' he added with a grin, 'that charity begins at home.'

'Quite so,' replied the fox; 'it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense. But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.'

'Then be quick and don't waste my time, for I can't wait much longer. What is it you want?'

'You must know,' said the fox, 'that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children. All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.'

'But the cheeses may be all finished by now?'

'If you were only to see the quantities of them!' laughed the fox. 'And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.'

'Well, I will come. Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!'"
fox-and-wolf,7,"All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky. The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily.

'Is it safe to go on, think you?' asked the wolf in a whisper. And the fox shook her head.

'Not while the dogs are barking,' said she; 'someone might come out to see if anything was the matter.' And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her.

In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them. Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of the wall."
fox-and-wolf,8,"'I am lighter than he is,' thought the fox to herself, 'and perhaps if I make haste I can get a start, and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one.' And she quickened her pace. But if the wolf could not run he could jump, and with one bound he was beside his companion.

'What were you going to do, comrade?'

'Oh, nothing,' replied the fox, much vexed at the failure of her plan.

'I think if I were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better,' said the wolf, giving a snap at her as he spoke. The fox drew back uneasily.

'Be careful, or I shall scream,' she snarled. And the wolf, understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat, gave a signal to his companion to leap on the wall, where he immediately followed her."
fox-and-wolf,9,"Once on the top they crouched down and looked about them. Not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard, and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well, with its two buckets suspended from a pole, just as the fox had described it. The two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along the wall till they were opposite the well, and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom, but just enough to reflect the moon, big, and round and yellow.

'How lucky!' cried she to the wolf. 'There is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel. Look! look! did you ever see anything so beautiful!'"
fox-and-wolf,10,"'Never!' answered the wolf, peering over in his turn, his eyes glistening greedily, for he imagined that the moon's reflection in the water was really a cheese.

'And now, unbeliever, what have you to say?' and the fox laughed gently.

'That you are a woman-I mean a fox-of your word,' replied the wolf.

'Well, then, go down in that bucket and eat your fill,' said the fox.

'Oh, is that your game?' asked the wolf, with a grin. 'No! no! The person who goes down in the bucket will be you! And if you don't go down your head will go without you!'

'Of course I will go down, with the greatest pleasure,' answered the fox, who had expected the wolf's reply.

'And be sure you don't eat all the cheese, or it will be the worse for you,' continued the wolf. But the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes.

'Farewell, suspicious one!' she said sadly. And climbed into the bucket.

In an instant she had reached the bottom of the well, and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs."
fox-and-wolf,11,"'Why, it is larger and richer than I thought,' cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over the wall of the well.

'Then be quick and bring it up,' commanded the wolf.

'How can I, when it weighs more than I do?' asked the fox.

'If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course,' said he.

'But I have no knife,' answered the fox. 'You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us.'

'And how am I to come down?' inquired the wolf.

'Oh, you are really very stupid! Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head.'

The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it. As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface."
fox-and-wolf,12,"As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him.

'But where is the cheese?' he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile.

'The cheese?' answered the fox; 'why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves.'

'Ah, traitor!' cried the wolf, howling with rage. But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before.

'Perhaps I did treat him rather badly,' she said to herself. 'But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up-at least it may!'"
golden-goose,1,"THERE was once a man who had three sons. The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity.

One day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him 'Good-morning,' and said: 'Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine-I am so hungry and thirsty.'"
golden-goose,2,"But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way;' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest. There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up.

Then the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother. He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine.

But the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of. Just go your own way, will you?' Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home."
golden-goose,3,"So then Dullhead said: 'Father, let me go out and cut wood.'

But his father answered: 'Both your brothers have injured themselves. You had better leave it alone; you know nothing about it.'

But Dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said: 'Very well, then-go. Perhaps when you have hurt yourself, you may learn to know better.' His mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and a bottle of sour beer."
golden-goose,4,"When he got to the forest, he too met the little grey old man, who greeted him and said: 'Give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.'

And Dullhead replied: 'I've only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer, but if you care to have that, let us sit down and eat.'

So they sat down, and when Dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake, and the sour beer into excellent wine. Then they ate and drank, and when they had finished the little man said: 'Now I will bring you luck, because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others. There stands an old tree; cut it down, and amongst its roots you'll find something.' With that the little man took leave."
golden-goose,5,"Then Dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree, and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose, whose feathers were all of pure gold. He lifted it out, carried it off, and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night.

Now the landlord of the inn had three daughters, and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be, and each longed to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought to herself: 'No doubt I shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers,' and the first time Dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing. But, lo and behold! her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose, and she could not take her hand away."
golden-goose,6,"Soon after the second daughter came in, and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too; but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well. At last the third sister came with the same intentions, but the other two cried out: 'Keep off! for Heaven's sake, keep off!'

The younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off, and thought to herself: 'If they are both there, why should not I be there too?'

So she sprang to them; but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her. So they all three had to spend the night with the goose."
golden-goose,7,"Next morning Dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and went off, without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. They just had to run after him right or left as best they could. In the middle of a field they met the parson, and when he saw this procession he cried: 'For shame, you bold girls! What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? Do you call that proper behaviour?' And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away. But directly he touched her he hung on himself, and had to run along with the rest of them.

Not long after the clerk came that way, and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls. 'Why, where is your reverence going so fast?' cried he; 'don't forget there is to be a christening to-day;' and he ran after him, caught him by the sleeve, and hung on to it himself: As the five of them trotted along in this fashion one after the other, two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes. On seeing them the parson called out and begged them to come and rescue him and the clerk. But no sooner did they touch the clerk than they stuck on too, and so there were seven of them running after Dullhead and his goose."
golden-goose,8,"After a time they all came to a town where a King reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh. So the King had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her.

When Dullhead heard this he marched before the Princess with his goose and its appendages, and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing, and could not stop herself. Then Dullhead claimed her as his bride, but the King, who did not much fancy him as a son-in-law, made all sorts of objections, and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine.

Dullhead bethought him of the little grey man, who could, he felt sure, help him; so he went off to the forest, and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face."
golden-goose,9,"Dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart, and the man answered: 'I don't know how I am ever to quench this terrible thirst I am suffering from. Cold water doesn't suit me at all. To be sure I've emptied a whole barrel of wine, but what is one drop on a hot stone?'

'I think I can help you,' said Dullhead. 'Come with me, and you shall drink to your heart's content.' So he took him to the King's cellar, and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed."
golden-goose,10,"Then Dullhead asked once more for his bride, but the King felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called 'Dullhead' carrying off his daughter, and he began to make fresh conditions. He required Dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread. Dullhead did not wait to consider long but went straight off to the forest, and there on the same spot sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body, and making a most woeful face the while. Said he: 'I've eaten up a whole oven full of loaves, but what's the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as I am? I declare my stomach feels quite empty, and I must draw my belt tight if I'm not to die of starvation.'

Dullhead was delighted, and said: 'Get up and come with me, and you shall have plenty to eat,' and he brought him to the King's Court."
golden-goose,11,"Now the King had given orders to have all the flour in his kingdom brought together, and to have a huge mountain baked of it. But the man from the wood just took up his stand before the mountain and began to eat, and in one day it had all vanished.

For the third time Dullhead asked for his bride, but again the King tried to make some evasion, and demanded a ship 'which could sail on land or water! When you come sailing in such a ship,' said he, 'you shall have my daughter without further delay.'"
golden-goose,12,"Again Dullhead started off to the forest, and there he found the little old grey man with whom he had shared his cake, and who said: 'I have eaten and I have drunk for you, and now I will give you the ship. I have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me.'

Then he gave Dullhead a ship which could sail on land or water, and when the King saw it he felt he could no longer refuse him his daughter.

So they celebrated the wedding with great rejoicings; and after the King's death Dullhead succeeded to the kingdom, and lived happily with his wife for many years after."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,1,"Long, long ago Japan was governed by Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto (or Augustness) in descent from the illustrious Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. He was not only as handsome as his ancestress was beautiful, but he was also very strong and brave, and was famous for being the greatest hunter in the land. Because of his matchless skill as a hunter, he was called ""Yama-sachi-hiko"" or ""The Happy Hunter of the Mountains."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,2,"His elder brother was a very skillful fisher, and as he far surpassed all rivals in fishing, he was named ""Umi-sachi-hiko"" or the ""Skillful Fisher of the Sea."" The brothers thus led happy lives, thoroughly enjoying their respective occupations, and the days passed quickly and pleasantly while each pursued his own way, the one hunting and the other fishing."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,3,"One day the Happy Hunter came to his brother, the Skillful Fisher, and said:

""Well, my brother, I see you go to the sea every day with your fishing rod in your hand, and when you return you come laden with fish. And as for me, it is my pleasure to take my bow and arrow and to hunt the wild animals up the mountains and down in the valleys. For a long time we have each followed our favorite occupation, so that now we must both be tired, you of your fishing and I of my hunting. Would it not be wise for us to make a change? Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea?"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,4,"The Skillful Fisher listened in silence to his brother, and for a moment was thoughtful, but at last he answered:

""O yes, why not? Your idea is not a bad one at all. Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,5,"So the matter was settled by this talk, and the two brothers each started out to try the other's occupation, little dreaming of all that would happen. It was very unwise of them, for the Happy Hunter knew nothing of fishing, and the Skillful Fisher, who was bad tempered, knew as much about hunting."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,6,"The Happy Hunter took his brother's much-prized fishing hook and rod
and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks. He baited his
hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily. He sat and gazed at the
little float bobbing up and down in the water, and longed for a good
fish to come and be caught. Every time the buoy moved a little he
pulled up his rod, but there was never a fish at the end of it, only
the hook and the bait. If he had known how to fish properly, he would
have been able to catch plenty of fish, but although he was the
greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling
fisher."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,7,"The whole day passed in this way, while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn. At last the day began to darken, and the evening came; still he had caught not a single fish. Drawing up his line for the last time before going home, he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,8,"He now began to feel extremely anxious, for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook, for, it being his only one, he valued it above all other things. The Happy Hunter now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook, and while he was searching to and fro, his brother, the Skillful Fisher, arrived on the scene. He had failed to find any game while hunting that day, and was not only in a bad temper, but looked fearfully cross. When he saw the Happy Hunter searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong, so he said at once:

""What are you doing, my brother?""

The Happy Hunter went forward timidly, for he feared his brother's anger, and said:

""Oh, my brother, I have indeed done badly.""

""What is the matter?-what have you done?"" asked the elder brother impatiently.

""I have lost your precious fishing hook-"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,9,"While he was still speaking his brother stopped him, and cried out fiercely:

""Lost my hook! It is just what I expected. For this reason, when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations I was really against it, but you seemed to wish it so much that I gave in and allowed you to do as you wished. The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen! And you have done badly. I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook. Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,10,"The Happy Hunter felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass, and bore his brother's scornful scolding with humility and patience. He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently, but it was nowhere to be found. He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it. He then went home, and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it.

He took these to his angry brother and offered them to him, asking his forgiveness, and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him. It was useless; his brother would not listen to him, much less grant his request."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,11,"The Happy Hunter then made another five hundred hooks, and again took them to his brother, beseeching him to pardon him.

""Though you make a million hooks,"" said the Skillful Fisher, shaking his head, ""they are of no use to me. I cannot forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,12,"Nothing would appease the anger of the Skillful Fisher, for he had a bad disposition, and had always hated his brother because of his virtues, and now with the excuse of the lost fishing hook he planned to kill him and to usurp his place as ruler of Japan. The Happy Hunter knew all this full well, but he could say nothing, for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience; so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook. He was much cast down, for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother's hook now. While he stood on the beach, lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next, an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand. The Happy Hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came, neither did he know how he was there-he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,13,"""You are Hohodemi, the Augustness, sometimes called the Happy Hunter, are you not?"" asked the old man. ""What are you doing alone in such a place?""

""Yes, I am he,"" answered the unhappy young man. ""Unfortunately, while fishing I lost my brother's precious fishing hook. I have hunted this shore all over, but alas! I cannot find it, and I am very troubled, for my brother won't forgive me till I restore it to him. But who are you?""

""My name is Shiwozuchino Okina, and I live near by on this shore. I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you. You must indeed be anxious. But if I tell you what I think, the hook is nowhere here-it is either at the bottom of the sea or in the body of some fish who has swallowed it, and for this reason, though you spend your whole life in looking for it here, you will never find it."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,14,"""Then what can I do?"" asked the distressed man.

""You had better go down to Ryn Gu and tell Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, what your trouble is and ask him to find the hook for you. I think that would be the best way.""

""Your idea is a splendid one,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""but I fear I cannot get to the Sea King's realm, for I have always heard that it is situated at the bottom of the sea."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,15,"""Oh, there will be no difficulty about your getting there,"" said the old man; ""I can soon make something for you to ride on through the sea.""

""Thank you,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""I shall be very grateful to you if you will be so kind.""

The old man at once set to work, and soon made a basket and offered it to the Happy Hunter. He received it with joy, and taking it to the water, mounted it, and prepared to start. He bade good by to the kind old man who had helped him so much, and told him that he would certainly reward him as soon as he found his hook and could return to Japan without fear of his brother's anger. The old man pointed out the direction he must take, and told him how to reach the realm of Ryn Gu, and watched him ride out to sea on the basket, which resembled a small boat."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,16,"The Happy Hunter made all the haste he could, riding on the basket which had been given him by his friend. His queer boat seemed to go through the water of its own accord, and the distance was much shorter than he had expected, for in a few hours he caught sight of the gate and the roof of the Sea King's Palace. And what a large place it was, with its numberless sloping roofs and gables, its huge gateways, and its gray stone walls! He soon landed, and leaving his basket on the beach, he walked up to the large gateway. The pillars of the gate were made of beautiful red coral, and the gate itself was adorned with glittering gems of all kinds. Large katsura trees overshadowed it. Our hero had often heard of the wonders of the Sea King's Palace beneath the sea, but all the stories he had ever heard fell short of the reality which he now saw for the first time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,17,"The Happy Hunter would have liked to enter the gate there and then, but he saw that it was fast closed, and also that there was no one about whom he could ask to open it for him, so he stopped to think what he should do. In the shade of the trees before the gate he noticed a well full of fresh spring water. Surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time, he thought. Then he climbed into the tree overhanging the well, and seated himself to rest on one of the branches, and waited for what might happen. Ere long he saw the huge gate swing open, and two beautiful women came out. Now the Mikoto (Augustness) had always heard that Ryn Gu was the realm of the Dragon King under the Sea, and had naturally supposed that the place was inhabited by dragons and similar terrible creatures, so that when he saw these two lovely princesses, whose beauty would be rare even in the world from which he had just come, he was exceedingly surprised, and wondered what it could mean."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,18,"He said not a word, however, but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees, waiting to see what they would do. He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets. Slowly and gracefully in their trailing garments they approached the well, standing in the shade of the katsura trees, and were about to draw water, all unknowing of the stranger who was watching them, for the Happy Hunter was quite hidden among the branches of the tree where he had posted himself."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,19,"As the two ladies leaned over the side of the well to let down their golden buckets, which they did every day in the year, they saw reflected in the deep still water the face of a handsome youth gazing at them from amidst the branches of the tree in whose shade they stood. Never before had they seen the face of mortal man; they were frightened, and drew back quickly with their golden buckets in their hands. Their curiosity, however, soon gave them courage, and they glanced timidly upwards to see the cause of the unusual reflection, and then they beheld the Happy Hunter sitting in the tree looking down at them with surprise and admiration. They gazed at him face to face, but their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,20,"When the Mikoto saw that he was discovered, he sprang down lightly from the tree and said:

""I am a traveler, and as I was very thirsty I came to the well in the hopes of quenching my thirst, but I could find no bucket with which to draw the water. So I climbed into the tree, much vexed, and waited for some one to come. Just at that moment, while I was thirstily and impatiently waiting, you noble ladies appeared, as if in answer to my great need. Therefore I pray you of your mercy give me some water to drink, for I am a thirsty traveler in a strange land."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,21,"His dignity and graciousness overruled their timidity, and bowing in silence they both once more approached the well, and letting down their golden buckets drew up some water and poured it into a jeweled cup and offered it to the stranger."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,22,"He received it from them with both hands, raising it to the height of his forehead in token of high respect and pleasure, and then drank the water quickly, for his thirst was great. When he had finished his long draught he set the cup down on the edge of the well, and drawing his short sword he cut off one of the strange curved jewels (magatama), a necklace of which hung round his neck and fell over his breast. He placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to them, and said, bowing deeply:

""This is a token of my thanks!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,23,"The two ladies took the cup, and looking into it to see what he had put inside-for they did not yet know what it was-they gave a start of surprise, for there lay a beautiful gem at the bottom of the cup.

""No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely. Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?"" said the elder damsel.

""Certainly,"" said the Happy Hunter, ""I am Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto, also called in Japan, the Happy Hunter."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,24,"""Are you indeed Hohodemi, the grandson of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess?"" asked the damsel who had spoken first. ""I am the eldest daughter of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, and my name is Princess Tayotama.""

""And,"" said the younger maiden, who at last found her tongue, ""I am her sister, the Princess Tamayori."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,25,"""Are you indeed the daughters of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea? I cannot tell you how glad I am to meet you,"" said the Happy Hunter. And without waiting for them to reply he went on:

""The other day I went fishing with my brother's hook and dropped it, how, I am sure I can't tell. As my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions, this is the greatest calamity that could have befallen me. Unless I find it again I can never hope to win my brother's forgiveness, for he is very angry at what I have done. I have searched for it many, many times, but I cannot find it, therefore I am much troubled. While I was hunting for the hook, in great distress, I met a wise old man, and he told me that the best thing I could do was to come to Ryn Gu, and to Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and ask him to help me. This kind old man also showed me how to come. Now you know how it is I am here and why. I want to ask Ryn Jin, if he knows where the lost hook is. Will you be so kind as to take me to your father? And do you think he will see me?"" asked the Happy Hunter anxiously."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,26,"Princess Tayotama listened to this long story, and then said:

""Not only is it easy for you to see my father, but he will be much pleased to meet you. I am sure he will say that good fortune has befallen him, that so great and noble a man as you, the grandson of Amaterasu, should come down to the bottom of the sea."" And then turning to her younger sister, she said:

""Do you not think so, Tamayori?""

""Yes, indeed,"" answered the Princess Tamayori, in her sweet voice. ""As you say, we can know no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home.""

""Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way,"" said the Happy Hunter.

""Condescend to enter, Mikoto (Augustness),"" said both the sisters, and bowing low, they led him through the gate."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,27,"The younger Princess left her sister to take charge of the Happy Hunter, and going faster than they, she reached the Sea King's Palace first, and running quickly to her father's room, she told him of all that had happened to them at the gate, and that her sister was even now bringing the Augustness to him. The Dragon King of the Sea was much surprised at the news, for it was but seldom, perhaps only once in several hundred years, that the Sea King's Palace was visited by mortals."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,28,"Ryn Jin at once clapped his hands and summoned all his courtiers and the servants of the Palace, and the chief fish of the sea together, and solemnly told them that the grandson of the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, was coming to the Palace, and that they must be very ceremonious and polite in serving the august visitor. He then ordered them all to the entrance of the Palace to welcome the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,29,"Ryn Jin then dressed himself in his robes of ceremony, and went out to welcome him. In a few moments the Princess Tayotama and the Happy Hunter reached the entrance, and the Sea King and his wife bowed to the ground and thanked him for the honor he did them in coming to see them. The Sea King then led the Happy Hunter to the guest room, and placing him in the uppermost seat, he bowed respectfully before him, and said:

""I am Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and this is my wife. Condescend to remember us forever!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,30,"""Are you indeed Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, of whom I have so often heard?"" answered the Happy Hunter, saluting his host most ceremoniously. ""I must apologize for all the trouble I am giving you by my unexpected visit."" And he bowed again, and thanked the Sea King.

""You need not thank me,"" said Ryn Jin. ""It is I who must thank you for coming. Although the Sea Palace is a poor place, as you see, I shall be highly honored if you will make us a long visit."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,31,"There was much gladness between the Sea King and the Happy Hunter, and they sat and talked for a long time. At last the Sea King clapped his hands, and then a huge retinue of fishes appeared, all robed in ceremonial garments, and bearing in their fins various trays on which all kinds of sea delicacies were served. A great feast was now spread before the King and his Royal guest. All the fishes-in-waiting were chosen from amongst the finest fish in the sea, so you can imagine what a wonderful array of sea creatures it was that waited upon the Happy Hunter that day. All in the Palace tried to do their best to please him and to show him that he was a much honored guest. During the long repast, which lasted for hours, Ryn Jin commanded his daughters to play some music, and the two Princesses came in and performed on the KOTO (the Japanese harp), and sang and danced in turns. The time passed so pleasantly that the Happy Hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the Sea King's Realm, and he gave himself up to the enjoyment of this wonderful place, the land of fairy fishes! Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place? But the Mikoto soon remembered what had brought him to Ryn Gu, and said to his host:"
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,32,"""Perhaps your daughters have told you, King Ryn Jin, that I have come here to try and recover my brother's fishing hook, which I lost while fishing the other day. May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?""

""Certainly,"" said the obliging Sea King, ""I will immediately summon them all here and ask them."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,33,"As soon as he had issued his command, the octopus, the cuttlefish, the bonito, the oxtail fish, the eel, the jelly fish, the shrimp, and the plaice, and many other fishes of all kinds came in and sat down before Ryn Jin their King, and arranged themselves and their fins in order. Then the Sea King said solemnly:

""Our visitor who is sitting before you all is the august grandson of Amaterasu. His name is Hohodemi, the fourth Augustness, and he is also called the Happy Hunter of the Mountains. While he was fishing the other day upon the shore of Japan, some one robbed him of his brother's fishing hook. He has come all this way down to the bottom of the sea to our Kingdom because he thought that one of you fishes may have taken the hook from him in mischievous play. If any of you have done so you must immediately return it, or if any of you know who the thief is you must at once tell us his name and where he is now."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,34,"All the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words, and could say nothing for some time. They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon King. At last the cuttlefish came forward and said:

""I think the TAI (the red bream) must be the thief who has stolen the hook!""

""Where is your proof?"" asked the King.

""Since yesterday evening the TAI has not been able to eat anything, and he seems to be suffering from a bad throat! For this reason I think the hook may be in his throat. You had better send for him at once!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,35,"All the fish agreed to this, and said:

""It is certainly strange that the TAI is the only fish who has not obeyed your summons. Will you send for him and inquire into the matter. Then our innocence will be proved.""

""Yes,"" said the Sea King, ""it is strange that the TAI has not come, for he ought to be the first to be here. Send for him at once!"""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,36,"Without waiting for the King's order the cuttlefish had already started for the TAI'S dwelling, and he now returned, bringing the TAI with him. He led him before the King.

The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill. He certainly was in pain, for his usually red face was pale, and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size.

""Answer, O TAI!"" cried the Sea King, ""why did you not come in answer to my summons today?""

""I have been ill since yesterday,"" answered the TAI; ""that is why I could not come.""

""Don't say another word!"" cried out Ryn Jin angrily. ""Your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the Mikoto's hook.""

""It is only too true!"" said the TAI; ""the hook is still in my throat, and all my efforts to get it out have been useless. I can't eat, and I can scarcely breathe, and each moment I feel that it will choke me, and sometimes it gives me great pain. I had no intention of stealing the Mikoto's hook. I heedlessly snapped at the bait which I saw in the water, and the hook came off and stuck in my throat. So I hope you will pardon me."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,37,"The cuttlefish now came forward, and said to the King:

""What I said was right. You see the hook still sticks in the TAI'S throat. I hope to be able to pull it out in the presence of the Mikoto, and then we can return it to him safely!""

""O please make haste and pull it out!"" cried the TAI, pitifully, for he felt the pains in his throat coming on again; ""I do so want to return the hook to the Mikoto.""

""All right, TAI SAN,"" said his friend the cuttlefish, and then opening the TAI'S mouth as wide as he could and putting one of his feelers down the TAI'S throat, he quickly and easily drew the hook out of the sufferer's large mouth. He then washed it and brought it to the King."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,38,"Ryn Jin took the hook from his subject, and then respectfully returned it to the Happy Hunter (the Mikoto or Augustness, the fishes called him), who was overjoyed at getting back his hook. He thanked Ryn Jin many times, his face beaming with gratitude, and said that he owed the happy ending of his quest to the Sea King's wise authority and kindness."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,39,"Ryn Jin now desired to punish the TAI, but the Happy Hunter begged him not to do so; since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor TAI. It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook, but he had already suffered enough for his fault, if fault it could be called. What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention. The Happy Hunter said he blamed himself; if he had understood how to fish properly he would never have lost his hook, and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do. So he begged the Sea King to forgive his subject."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,40,"Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge? Ryn Jin forgave his subject at once at the request of his august guest. The TAI was so glad that he shook his fins for joy, and he and all the other fish went out from the presence of their King, praising the virtues of the Happy Hunter."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,41,"Now that the hook was found the Happy Hunter had nothing to keep him in Ryn Gu, and he was anxious to get back to his own kingdom and to make peace with his angry brother, the Skillful Fisher; but the Sea King, who had learnt to love him and would fain have kept him as a son, begged him not to go so soon, but to make the Sea Palace his home as long as ever he liked. While the Happy Hunter was still hesitating, the two lovely Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, came, and with the sweetest of bows and voices joined with their father in pressing him to stay, so that without seeming ungracious he could not say them ""Nay,"" and was obliged to stay on for some time."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,42,"Between the Sea Realm and the Earth there was no difference in the night of time, and the Happy Hunter found that three years went fleeting quickly by in this delightful land. The years pass swiftly when any one is truly happy. But though the wonders of that enchanted land seemed to be new every day, and though the Sea King's kindness seemed rather to increase than to grow less with time, the Happy Hunter grew more and more homesick as the days passed, and he could not repress a great anxiety to know what had happened to his home and his country and his brother while he had been away."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,43,"So at last he went to the Sea King and said:

""My stay with you here has been most happy and I am very grateful to you for all your kindness to me, but I govern Japan, and, delightful as this place is, I cannot absent myself forever from my country. I must also return the fishing hook to my brother and ask his forgiveness for having deprived him of it for so long. I am indeed very sorry to part from you, but this time it cannot be helped. With your gracious permission, I will take my leave to-day. I hope to make you another visit some day. Please give up the idea of my staying longer now."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,44,"King Ryn Jin was overcome with sorrow at the thought that he must lose his friend who had made a great diversion in the Palace of the Sea, and his tears fell fast as he answered:

""We are indeed very sorry to part with you, Mikoto, for we have enjoyed your stay with us very much. You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome. I quite understand that as you govern Japan you ought to be there and not here, and that it is vain for us to try and keep you longer with us, much as we would like to have you stay. I hope you will not forget us. Strange circumstances have brought us together and I trust the friendship thus begun between the Land and the Sea will last and grow stronger than it has ever been before."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,45,"When the Sea King had finished speaking he turned to his two daughters and bade them bring him the two Tide-Jewels of the Sea. The two Princesses bowed low, rose and glided out of the hall. In a few minutes they returned, each one carrying in her hands a flashing gem which filled the room with light. As the Happy Hunter looked at them he wondered what they could be. The Sea King took them from his daughters and said to his guest:

""These two valuable talismans we have inherited from our ancestors from time immemorial. We now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you. These two gems are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,46,"The Happy Hunter bowed low to the ground and said:

""I can never thank you enough for all your kindness to me. And now will you add one more favor to the rest and tell me what these jewels are and what I am to do with them?""

""The nanjiu,"" answered the Sea King, ""is also called the Jewel of the Flood Tide, and whoever holds it in his possession can command the sea to roll in and to flood the land at any time that he wills. The kanjiu is also called the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, and this gem controls the sea and the waves thereof, and will cause even a tidal wave to recede."""
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,47,"Then Ryn Jin showed his friend how to use the talismans one by one and handed them to him. The Happy Hunter was very glad to have these two wonderful gems, the Jewel of the Flood Tide and the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, to take back with him, for he felt that they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time. After thanking his kind host again and again, he prepared to depart. The Sea King and the two Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, and all the inmates of the Palace, came out to say ""Good-by,"" and before the sound of the last farewell had died away the Happy Hunter passed out from under the gateway, past the well of happy memory standing in the shade of the great KATSURA trees on his way to the beach."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,48,"Here he found, instead of the queer basket on which he had come to the Realm of Ryn Gu, a large crocodile waiting for him. Never had he seen such a huge creature. It measured eight fathoms in length from the tip of its tail to the end of its long mouth. The Sea King had ordered the monster to carry the Happy Hunter back to Japan. Like the wonderful basket which Shiwozuchino Okina had made, it could travel faster than any steamboat, and in this strange way, riding on the back of a crocodile, the Happy Hunter returned to his own land."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,49,"As soon as the crocodile landed him, the Happy Hunter hastened to tell the Skillful Fisher of his safe return. He then gave him back the fishing hook which had been found in the mouth of the TAI and which had been the cause of so much trouble between them. He earnestly begged his brother's forgiveness, telling him all that had happened to him in the Sea King's Palace and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the hook."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,50,"Now the Skillful Fisher had used the lost hook as an excuse for driving his brother out of the country. When his brother had left him that day three years ago, and had not returned, he had been very glad in his evil heart and had at once usurped his brother's place as ruler of the land, and had become powerful and rich. Now in the midst of enjoying what did not belong to him, and hoping that his brother might never return to claim his rights, quite unexpectedly there stood the Happy Hunter before him."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,51,"The Skillful Fisher feigned forgiveness, for he could make no more excuses for sending his brother away again, but in his heart he was very angry and hated his brother more and more, till at last he could no longer bear the sight of him day after day, and planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him.

One day when the Happy Hunter was walking in the rice fields his brother followed him with a dagger. The Happy Hunter knew that his brother was following him to kill him, and he felt that now, in this hour of great danger, was the time to use the Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide and prove whether what the Sea King had told him was true or not."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,52,So he took out the Jewel of the Flood Tide from the bosom of his dress and raised it to his forehead. Instantly over the fields and over the farms the sea came rolling in wave upon wave till it reached the spot where his brother was standing. The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and terrified to see what was happening. In another minute he was struggling in the water and calling on his brother to save him from drowning.
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,53,"The Happy Hunter had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother's distress. He at once put back the Jewel of the Flood Tide and took out the Jewel of the Ebb Tide. No sooner did he hold it up as high as his forehead than the sea ran back and back, and ere long the tossing rolling floods had vanished, and the farms and fields and dry land appeared as before."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,54,"The Skillful Fisher was very frightened at the peril of death in which he had stood, and was greatly impressed by the wonderful things he had seen his brother do. He learned now that he was making a fatal mistake to set himself against his brother, younger than he thought he was, for he now had become so powerful that the sea would flow in and the tide ebb at his word of command. So he humbled himself before the Happy Hunter and asked him to forgive him all the wrong he had done him. The Skillful Fisher promised to restore his brother to his rights and also swore that though the Happy Hunter was the younger brother and owed him allegiance by right of birth, that he, the Skillful Fisher, would exalt him as his superior and bow before him as Lord of all Japan."
happy-hunter-skillful-fisher,55,"Then the Happy Hunter said that he would forgive his brother if he would throw into the receding tide all his evil ways. The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers. From this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother.

The Happy Hunter now ruled his Kingdom without being disturbed by family strife, and there was peace in Japan for a long, long time. Above all the treasures in his house he prized the wonderful Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide which had been given him by Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea.

This is the congratulatory ending of the Happy Hunter and the Skillful Fisher."
hat-of-huldres,1,"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of
cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,
for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride
and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of
attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,
here I am back again."""
hat-of-huldres,2,"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife.

""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so
much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little
consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there.""

""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his
wife."
hat-of-huldres,3,"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a huldre hat.

""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?""
asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it
outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the huldres
disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away.
Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the
wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,
and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,1,"Many, many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a
tennis-ball growing out of his right cheek. This lump was a great
disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him that for many years he
spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it. He tried
everything he could think of. He consulted many doctors far and near,
and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally. But it
was all of no use. The lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was
nearly as big as his face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever
losing it, and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the
lump on his face all his life."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,2,"One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted
some at once, the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up
among the hills not very far from his home. It was a fine day in the
early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry
to get home. So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was
chopping wood, and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his
wife. When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his face
homewards."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,3,"The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the
sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily. He looked about for some
shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's hut near. At last
he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree. The hole was near
the ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had
only been overtaken by a mountain shower, and that the weather would
soon clear."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,4,"But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain
fell more and more heavily, and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over
the mountain. The thunder roared so terrifically, and the heavens
seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly
believe himself to be alive. He thought that he must die of fright. At
last, however, the sky cleared, and the whole country was aglow in the
rays of the setting sun. The old man's spirits revived when he looked
out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his
strange hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed
like the approaching steps of several people caught his ear. He at once
thought that his friends had come to look for him, and he was delighted
at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,5,"But on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his
friends, but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot. The more he
looked, the greater was his astonishment. Some of these demons were as
large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the
rest of their bodies, others again had absurdly long noses, and some
had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear. All had
horns growing on their foreheads. The old man was so surprised at what
he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree.
Fortunately for him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the
background. So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,6,"While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be
able to get home, he heard the sounds of gay music, and then some of
the demons began to sing.

""What are these creatures doing?"" said the old man to himself. ""I will
look out, it sounds very amusing."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,7,"On peeping out, the old man saw that the demon chief himself was
actually sitting with his back against the tree in which he had taken
refuge, and all the other demons were sitting round, some drinking and
some dancing. Food and wine was spread before them on the ground, and
the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying
themselves immensely."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,8,"It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.

""How amusing this is!"" laughed the old man to himself ""I am now quite
old, but I have never seen anything so strange in all my life.""

He was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were
doing, that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood
looking on."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,9,"The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of
the demons dancing. In a little while he said with a bored air:

""Your dance is rather monotonous. I am tired of watching it. Isn't
there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,10,"Now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life, and was quite an
expert in the art, and he knew that he could do much better than the
demon.

""Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human
being can do? It may be dangerous, for if I don't please them they may
kill me!"" said the old fellow to himself."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,11,"His fears, however, were soon overcome by his love of dancing. In a few
minutes he could restrain himself no longer, and came out before the
whole party of demons and began to dance at once. The old man,
realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these
strange creatures or not, exerted his skill and wit to the utmost."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,12,"The demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly
taking part in their entertainment, and then their surprise soon gave
place to admiration.

""How strange!"" exclaimed the horned chief. ""I never saw such a skillful
dancer before! He dances admirably!"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,13,"When the old man had finished his dance, the big demon said:

""Thank you very much for your amusing dance. Now give us the pleasure
of drinking a cup of wine with us,"" and with these words he handed him
his largest wine-cup."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,14,"The old man thanked him very humbly:

""I did not expect such kindness from your lordship. I fear I have only
disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing.""

""No, no,"" answered the big demon. ""You must come often and dance for
us. Your skill has given us much pleasure.""

The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.

""Then will you come again to-morrow, old man?"" asked the demon.

""Certainly, I will,"" answered the old man.

""Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us,"" said the demon.

""Whatever you like,"" said the old man.

""Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge?"" asked
the demon, looking round."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,15,"Then said one of the demon's attendants kneeling behind the chief:

""The token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in
his possession. I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek. Now
mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate. Let my lord take the
lump from the old man's right cheek, and he will surely come to-morrow,
if only to get that back."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,16,"""You are very clever,"" said the demon chief, giving his horns an
approving nod. Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand,
and took the great lump from the old man's right cheek. Strange to say,
it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's
touch, and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,17,"The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened. He
hardly knew for some time where he was. When he came to understand what
had happened to him, he was delighted to find that the lump on his
face, which had for so many years disfigured him, had really been taken
away without any pain to himself. He put up his hand to feel if any
scar remained, but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,18,"The sun had long set, and the young moon had risen like a silver
crescent in the sky. The old man suddenly realized how late it was and
began to hurry home. He patted his right cheek all the time, as if to
make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen. He was so happy
that he found it impossible to walk quietly--he ran and danced the
whole way home."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,19,"He found his wife very anxious, wondering what had happened to make him
so late. He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that
afternoon. She was quite as happy as her husband when he showed her
that the ugly lump had disappeared from his face, for in her youth she
had prided herself on his good looks, and it had been a daily grief to
her to see the horrid growth."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,20,"Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and
disagreeable old man. He, too, had for many years been troubled with
the growth of a wen on his left cheek, and he, too, had tried all
manner of things to get rid of it, but in vain."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,21,"He heard at once, through the servant, of his neighbor's good luck in
losing the lump on his face, so he called that very evening and asked
his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it. The
good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to
him. He described the place where he would find the hollow tree in
which to hide, and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon
towards the time of sunset."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,22,"The old neighbor started out the very next afternoon, and after hunting
about for some time, came to the hollow tree just as his friend had
described. Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,23,"Just as he had been told, the band of demons came at that hour and held
a feast with dance and song. When this had gone on for some time the
chief of the demons looked around and said:

""It is now time for the old man to come as he promised us. Why doesn't
he come?"""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,24,"When the second old man heard these words he ran out of his
hiding-place in the tree and, kneeling down before the Oni, said:

""I have been waiting for a long time for you to speak!""

""Ah, you are the old man of yesterday,"" said the demon chief. ""Thank
you for coming, you must dance for us soon."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,25,"The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance. But he
had never learned to dance, and knew nothing about the necessary
gestures and different positions. He thought that anything would please
the demons, so he just hopped about, waving his arms and stamping his
feet, imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,26,"The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition, and said amongst
themselves:

""How badly he dances to-day!""

Then to the old man the demon chief said:

""Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of
yesterday. We don't wish to see any more of such dancing. We will give
you back the pledge you left with us. You must go away at once."""
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,27,"With these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he
had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day
before, and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before
him. The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if
it had grown there always, and all attempts to pull it off were
useless. The wicked old man, instead of losing the lump on his left
cheek as he had hoped, found to his dismay that he had but added
another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first."
how-an-old-man-lost-his-wen,28,"He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to
make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare. No, sure enough
there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left.
The demons had all disappeared, and there was nothing for him to do but
to return home. He was a pitiful sight, for his face, with the two
large lumps, one on each side, looked just like a Japanese gourd."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,1,"At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. Those who came first were the saints of the sword. They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace. The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers. They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies. And death was an everyday matter to them."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,2,"Old Dragonbeard must have been a master swordsman standing midway between those of the first and of the second order. Molo, however, of whom this story tells, was a sword hero.

At that time there lived a young man named Tsui, whose father was a high official and the friend of the prince. And the father once sent his son to visit his princely friend, who was ill. The son was young, handsome and gifted. He went to carry out his father's instructions. When he entered the prince's palace, there stood three beautiful slave girls, who piled rosy peaches into a golden bowl, poured sugar over them and presented them to him. After he had eaten he took his leave, and his princely host ordered one of the slave girls, Rose-Red by name, to escort him to the gate. As they went along the young man kept looking back at her. And she smiled at him and made signs with her fingers. First she would stretch out three fingers, then she would turn her hand around three times, and finally she would point to a little mirror which she wore on her breast. When they parted she whispered to him: ""Do not forget me!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,3,"When the young man reached home his thoughts were all in confusion. And he sat down absent-mindedly like a wooden rooster. Now it happened that he had an old servant named Molo, who was an extraordinary being.

""What is the trouble, master,"" said he. ""Why are you so sad? Do you not want to tell your old slave about it?""

So the boy told him what had occurred, and also mentioned the signs the girl had made to him in secret."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,4,"Said Molo: ""When she stretched out three fingers, it meant that she is quartered in the third court of the palace. When she turned round her hand three times, it meant the sum of three times five fingers, which is fifteen. When she pointed at the little mirror, she meant to say that on the fifteenth, when the moon is round as a mirror, at midnight, you are to go for her.""

Then the young man was roused from his confused thoughts, and was so happy he could hardly control himself.

But soon he grew sad again and said: ""The prince's palace is shut off as though by an ocean. How would it be possible to win into it?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,5,"""Nothing easier,"" said Molo. ""On the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them, and thus I will carry you there. Yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl's court, who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god. No one can pass by him, so he must be killed.""

When the appointed day had come, the servant said: ""There is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself!""

Full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine, and the old man took a chain-hammer and disappeared with it."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,6,"And after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said: ""The dog is dead, and there is nothing further to hinder us!""

At midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk, and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace. They reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar. Then they saw the glow of a little lamp, and heard Rose-Red sigh deeply. The entire court was silent and deserted. The youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room. Long and searchingly Rose-Red looked at him, then seized his hand.

""I knew that you were intelligent, and would understand my sign language. But what magic power have you at your disposal, that you were able to get here?"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,7,"The youth told her in detail how Molo had helped him.

""And where is Molo?"" she asked.

""Outside, before the curtain,"" was his answer."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,8,"Then she called him in and gave him wine to drink from a jade goblet and said: ""I am of good family and have come here from far away. Force alone has made me a slave in this palace. I long to leave it. For though I have jasper chop-sticks with which to eat, and drink my wine from golden flagons, though silk and satin rustle around me and jewels of every kind are at my disposal, all these are but so many chains and fetters to hold me here. Dear Molo, you are endowed with magic powers. I beg you to save me in my distress! If you do, I will be glad to serve your master as a slave, and will never forget the favor you do me."""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,9,"The youth looked at Molo. Molo was quite willing. First he asked permission to carry away Rose-Red's gear and jewels in sacks and bags. Three times he went away and returned until he had finished. Then he took his master and Rose-Red upon his back, and flew away with them over the steep walls. None of the watchmen of the prince's palace noticed anything out of the way. At home the youth hid Rose-Red in a distant room.

When the prince discovered that one of his slave-girls was missing, and that one of his wild dogs had been killed, he said: ""That must have been some powerful sword hero!"" And he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned, and that investigations should be made in secret."
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,10,"Two years passed, and the youth no longer thought of any danger. Hence, when the flowers began to bloom in the spring, Rose-Red went driving in a small wagon outside the city, near the river. And there one of the prince's servants saw her, and informed his master. The latter sent for the youth, who, since he could not conceal the matter, told him the whole story exactly as it had happened.

Said the prince: ""The whole blame rests on Rose-Red. I do not reproach you. Yet since she is now your wife I will let the whole matter rest. But Molo will have to suffer for it!"""
how-molo-stole-the-lovely-rose-red,11,"So he ordered a hundred armored soldiers, with bows and swords, to surround the house of the youth, and under all circumstances to take Molo captive. But Molo drew his dagger and flew up the high wall. Thence he looked about him like a hawk. The arrows flew as thick as rain, but not one hit him. And in a moment he had disappeared, no one knew where.

Yet ten years later one of his former master's servants ran across him in the South, where he was selling medicine. And he looked exactly as he had looked ten years before."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,1,"Long, long ago, in old Japan, the Kingdom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful King. He was called Rin Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea. His power was immense, for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small, and in his keeping were the Jewels of the Ebb and Flow of the Tide. The Jewel of the Ebbing Tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to recede from the land, and the Jewel of the Flowing Tide made the waves to rise mountains high and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,2,"The Palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever seen anything like it even in dreams. The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase, and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl. But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone. At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful. So he decided to take a wife. Calling all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,3,"At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon. Her scales were of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and she was dressed in gorgeous robes. All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.

The King fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor. Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps, came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life. Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before. The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other. Each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,4,"Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily. They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral Palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and gardens. Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day.

Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed. The King was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine. He gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,5,"Then the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen. The doctor was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find it in the sea.

""Do you mean to tell me that you can't get the medicine here?"" asked the Dragon King.

""It is just as you say!"" said the doctor.

""Tell me what it is you want for the Queen?"" demanded Rin Jin.

""I want the liver of a live monkey!"" answered the doctor.

""The liver of a live monkey! Of course that will be most difficult to get,"" said the King.

""If we could only get that for the Queen, Her Majesty would soon recover,"" said the doctor.

""Very well, that decides it; we MUST get it somehow or other. But where are we most likely to find a monkey?"" asked the King."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,6,"Then the doctor told the Dragon King that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island where a great many monkeys lived.

""If only you could capture one of these monkeys?"" said the doctor.

""How can any of my people capture a monkey?"" said the Dragon King, greatly puzzled. ""The monkeys live on dry land, while we live in the water; and out of our element we are quite powerless! I don't see what we can do!""

""That has been my difficulty too,"" said the doctor. ""But amongst your innumerable servants you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose!""

""Something must be done,"" said the King, and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,7,"The chief steward thought for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, said joyfully:

""I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jelly fish). He is certainly ugly to look at, but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one.""

The jelly fish was then summoned to the King's presence, and was told by His Majesty what was required of him.

The jelly fish, on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be intrusted to him, looked very troubled, and said that he had never been to the island in question, and as he had never had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,8,"""Well,"" said the chief steward, ""if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!""

""How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it,"" said the perplexed jelly fish.

""This is what you must do,"" said the wily chief steward. ""When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!""

""But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?"" said the reluctant jelly fish.

""You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!"" said the chief steward.

""Won't he be very heavy?"" queried kurage again.

""You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King,"" replied the chief steward.

""I will do my best then,"" said the jelly fish, and he swam away from the Palace and started off towards the Monkey Island. Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for-a live monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,9,"""I'm in luck!"" thought the jelly fish. ""Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the Palace, and my part will be done!""

So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree. In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said:

""How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?""

""A very fine day,"" answered the monkey from the tree. ""I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?""

""My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it,"" answered the jelly fish.

""I am very glad to see you,"" said the monkey.

""By the bye,"" said the jelly fish, ""have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?""

""I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!"" answered the monkey.

""Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description-it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,"" said the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,10,"""Is it so beautiful as all that?"" asked the monkey in astonishment.

Then the jelly fish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty and grandeur of the Sea King's Palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees of white, pink and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on the branches. The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,11,"""I have got him at last!"" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said:

""Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you-a land-lubber.""

""I should love to go,"" said the monkey, ""but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as you surely know!""

""There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back.""

""That will be troubling you too much,"" said the monkey.

""I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,"" said the jelly fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.

""Keep very still, Mr. monkey,"" said the jelly fish. ""You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's Palace.""

""Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,"" said the monkey."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,12,"Thus they went along, the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back. When they were about half-way, the jelly fish, who knew very little of anatomy, began to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not!

""Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?""

The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jelly fish wanted with a liver.

""That is the most important thing of all,"" said the stupid jelly fish, ""so as soon as I recollected it, I asked you if you had yours with you?""

""Why is my liver so important to you?"" asked the monkey.

""Oh! you will learn the reason later,"" said the jelly fish."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,13,"The monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious, and urged the jelly fish to tell him for what his liver was wanted, and ended up by appealing to his hearer's feelings by saying that he was very troubled at what he had been told.

Then the jelly fish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him everything. How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one.

""Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the Palace the doctor will want your liver, so I feel sorry for you!"" said the silly jelly fish.

The poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon him. He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.

But the monkey was a clever animal, and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt, so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,14,"""The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!"" thought the monkey. At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish:

""What a pity it was, Mr. Jelly Fish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!""

""If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,"" answered the jelly fish.

""You are quite mistaken,"" said the monkey. ""Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree.""

""Have you left your liver behind you?"" asked the jelly fish.

""Yes,"" said the cunning monkey, ""during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should have brought it along with me!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,15,"The jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey said. The monkey was of no good without a liver. Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.

""Well,"" said the monkey, ""that is soon remedied. I am really sorry to think of all your trouble; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to get my liver.""

The jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver, and bring it with him the next time. Thus persuaded, the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more.

No sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into the pine-tree where the jelly fish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jelly fish said:

""So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon King on your return!"""
jelly-fish-and-monkey,16,"The jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered. Then he asked the monkey if it wasn't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver.

The monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver: it was too precious.

""But remember your promise!"" pleaded the jelly fish, now very discouraged.

""That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!"" answered the monkey. Then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,17,"""Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!"" added the monkey mockingly from the tree.

There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him.

Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish. When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,18,"Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish. He quaked all over as he told his story. How he had brought the monkey halfway over the sea, and then had stupidly let out the secret of his commission; how the monkey had deceived him by making him believe that he had left his liver behind him.

The Dragon King's wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished. The punishment was a horrible one. All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks."
jelly-fish-and-monkey,19,"The poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the Dragon King's order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness.

From this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan."
lucky-andrew,1,"There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and
Lucky Andrew. The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can
quite make head or tail. He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with,
and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are,
as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with
these attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high
spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might
be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star.
When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face
till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a
lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his
boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him
hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and
asked him how he felt, he would reply: ""O, quite well. I have been
saved. I surely am in luck!"""
lucky-andrew,2,"When their father died, both of them were of age, and not long after
they both had to go out to the sand-banks to fetch some fishing-nets,
which had been left there since the summer fishing. It was late in
the fall, after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer
fishing. Andrew had his gun along, which he carried with him wherever he
went. John Nicholas did not say much while they were underway; but he
thought all the harder. They were not ready to set out for home again
until near evening."
lucky-andrew,3,"""Hark, Lucky Andrew, do you know there will be a storm to-night?"" said
John Nicholas, and looked out across the sea. ""I think it would be best
if we stayed here until morning!""

""There'll be no storm,"" said Andrew. ""The Seven Sisters have not put on
their fog-caps, so you may be quite at rest."""
lucky-andrew,4,"But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to
remain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone;
and he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point
of the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a
sea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still
provisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other
things. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. ""He will come back
this evening,"" said he. ""Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.""
But in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited
day by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his
brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to
keep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And
such was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his
homeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew
had been drowned."
lucky-andrew,5,"But the latter did not lose heart. He gathered drift-wood along the
strand, shot sea-birds, and looked for mussels and roots. He built
himself a raft of drift-timber, and fished with a pole that had also
been left behind. One day, while he was at work, he happened to notice a
depression or hollow in the sand, as though made by the keel of a large
Northland schooner, and he could plainly trace the braidings of the
hawsers from the strand up to the top of the island. Then he thought to
himself that he was in no danger, for he saw there was truth in the
report he had often heard, that the meer-folk made the island their
abode, and did much business with their ships."
lucky-andrew,6,"""God be praised for good company! That was just what I needed. Yes, it
is true, as I have always said, that I was born under a lucky star,""
thought Andrew to himself; perhaps he said so too, for occasionally he
really had to talk a little. So he lived through the fall. Once he saw a
boat, and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it; but that very moment
the sail dropped, and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top
speed, for they thought the meer-trolls were making signs and waving."
lucky-andrew,7,"On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; and when
he came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland
schooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had
never yet seen. It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him
to be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven
of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and
handsome as any Northlander might wish to have. The whole schooner was
filled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the
helm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for
she wore a crown and costly garments. Yet any one could see that she was
a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk. In
fact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever
had seen. The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; but with
his usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled
down his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid
himself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut. He soon
noticed that the whole room was alive with people."
lucky-andrew,8,"They filled it completely and more, and still more of them came in. Then the walls
began to crack, and the little hut spread out at all corners, and grew
so splendid and magnificent that the wealthiest merchant could not have
had its equal; it was almost like being in a royal castle. Tables were
covered with the most exquisite silver and gold. When they had eaten
they began to dance. Under cover of the noise, Andrew crept to the
look-out at the side of the roof, and climbed down. Then he ran to the
schooner, threw his flint-stone over it, and in order to make certain,
cut a cross into it with his sharp-cutting knife. When he came back
again, the dance was in full swing. The tables were dancing and the
benches and chairs--everything else in the room was dancing, too. The
only one who did not dance was the bride; she only sat there and looked
on, and when the bridegroom came to fetch her, she sent him away. For
the moment there was no thought of stopping."
lucky-andrew,9,"The fiddler knew neither rest nor repose, and did not pass his cap, but played merrily on with his left hand, and beat time with his foot, until he was dripping with
sweat, and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke. When Andrew
noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing, he
thought to himself: ""Now I had better shoot away, or else he will play
me right off the ground!"" So he turned his gun, thrust it through the
window, and shot it off over the bride's head; but upside down,
otherwise the bullet would have hit him. The moment the shot crashed,
all the troll-folk tumbled out of the door together; but when they saw
that the schooner was banned on the shore, they wailed and crept into a
hole in the hill. But all the gold and silver dishes were left behind,
and the bride, too, was still sitting there. She told Lucky Andrew that
she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child.
Once, when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking, she
had taken her along; but when she had to go home for a moment, she left
the child sitting under a juniper-bush, and told her that she might eat
the berries if she only repeated three times:

      ""I eat juniper-berries blue,
      Wherein Jesu's cross I view.
      I eat whortle-berries red,
      Since 'twas for my sake He bled!"""
lucky-andrew,10,"But after her mother had gone, she found so many berries that she forgot
to say her verse, and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill. And
there no harm had been done her, save that she had lost the top joint of
the little finger of her left hand, and the goblins had been kind to
her; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it
should be, she felt as though something weighed upon her, and she had
suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for
her husband. When Andrew learned who her mother and her people were, he
saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. So
Andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. Then they
sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver,
and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrew was
far wealthier than his brother."
lucky-andrew,11,"But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth had come from, did
not wish to be any poorer than Andrew. He knew that trolls and goblins
walk mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he sailed out to the
sand banks at that time. And on Christmas Eve he did see a light or
fire, but it seemed to be like will-o'-the-wisps fluttering about. When
he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible howls, and cold, piercing
cries, and there was a smell of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide.
Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls
on the shore. They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely
covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous
fist-gloves. In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed.
When they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like
that of rotting wood, and when they shook themselves they showered
sparks about them. When they drew nearer, John Nicholas crawled up into
the loft as his brother had done. The goblins dragged a great stone into
the hut, and began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile
they screamed so that John Nicholas's blood turned to ice in his
hiding-place. Then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth
in order to make the fire burn again; while the others carried in
heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy as lead."
lucky-andrew,12,"The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to
catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the
look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother,
stuck fast and could move neither in nor out. Then he grew frightened
and began to scream; but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared
and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut. But
when the cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas freed himself,
too. Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason,
and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the
troll in the Northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms
and lofts where he happened to be. Before his death, however, his reason
returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say. But
after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again. They sank,
and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands. Andrew's
luck held good; no ship made more successful trips than his own; but
whenever he came to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed--the goblins went
aboard or ashore with their goods--but after a time he had fair winds,
whether he happened to want to go to Bergen, or sail home. He had many
children, and all of them were bright and vigorous, yet every one of
them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand."
old-hop-giant,1,"Once upon a time there were two neighbors: one of them rich and the
other poor. They owned a great meadow in common, which they were
supposed to mow together and then divide the hay."
old-hop-giant,2,"But the rich neighbor wanted the meadow for himself alone, and told
the poor one that he would drive him out of house and home if he did
not come to an agreement with him that whichever one of them mowed the
largest stretch of the meadowland in a single day, should receive the
entire meadow."
old-hop-giant,3,"Now the rich neighbor got together as many mowers as ever he could;
but the poor one could not hire a single man. At last he despaired
altogether and wept, because he did not know how he could manage to
get so much as a bit of hay for the cow."
old-hop-giant,4,"Then it was that a large man stepped up to him and said: ""Do not
grieve so. I can tell you what you ought to do. When the mowing
begins, just call out 'Old Hopgiant!' three times in succession, and
you'll not be at a loss, as you shall see for yourself."" And with that
he disappeared."
old-hop-giant,5,"Then the poor man's heart grew less heavy, and he gave over worrying.
So one fine day his rich neighbor came along with no fewer than twenty
farmhands, and they mowed down one swath after another. But the poor
neighbor did not even take the trouble to begin when he saw how the
others took hold, and that he himself would not be able to do anything
alone."
old-hop-giant,6,"Then the big man occurred to him, and he called out: ""Old Hopgiant!""
But no one came, and the mowers all laughed at him and mocked him,
thinking he had gone out of his mind. Then he called again: ""Old
Hopgiant!"" And, just as before, there was no hopgiant to be seen. And
the mowers could scarcely swing their scythes; for they were laughing
fit to split."
old-hop-giant,7,"And then he cried for the third time: ""Old Hopgiant!"" And there
appeared a fellow of truly horrible size, with a scythe as large as a
ship's mast."
old-hop-giant,8,"And now the merriment of the rich peasant's mowers came to an end. For
when the giant began to mow and fling about his scythe, they were
frightened at the strength he put into his work. And before they knew
it he had mown half the meadow."
old-hop-giant,9,"Then the rich neighbor fell into a rage, rushed up and gave the giant
a good kick. But that did not help him, for his foot stuck to the
giant, while the latter no more felt the kick than if it had been a
flea-bite, and kept right on working."
old-hop-giant,10,"Then the rich neighbor thought of a scheme to get free, and gave the
giant a kick with his other foot; but this foot also stuck fast, and
there he hung like a tick. Old Hopgiant mowed the whole meadow, and
then flew up into the air, and the rich man had to go along hanging to
him like a hawser. And thus the poor neighbor was left sole master of
the place."
self-did-it,1,"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind
flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a
poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite
impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big
tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the
fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her.
""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;
kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again."
self-did-it,2,"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground.

""Self is my name,"" said the woman.

That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull
the fire apart. Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built
it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the
fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground. Then
the latter screamed and ran away, crying:

""Father, father! Self burned me!""

""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"" came the
answer from below the hill."
the-dwarfie-stone,1,"Far up in a green valley in the Island of Hoy stands an immense boulder.It is hollow inside, and the natives of these northern islands call itthe Dwarfie Stone, because long centuries ago, so the legend has it,Snorro the Dwarf lived there.Nobody knew where Snorro came from, or how long he had dwelt in the darkchamber inside the Dwarfie Stone. All that they knew about him was thathe was a little man, with a queer, twisted, deformed body and a face ofmarvellous beauty, which never seemed to look any older, but was alwayssmiling and young.Men said that this was because Snorro's father had been a Fairy, and nota denizen of earth, who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetualyouth, but nobody knew whether this were true or not, for the Dwarf hadinhabited the Dwarfie Stone long before the oldest man or woman in Hoyhad been born.One thing was certain, however: he had inherited from his mother, whomall men agreed had been mortal, the dangerous qualities of vanity andambition. And the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did hebecome, until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel roundhis neck, into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflectionof his handsome face."
the-dwarfie-stone,2,"And he would not attend to the country people who came to seek his help,unless they bowed themselves humbly before him and spoke to him as if hewere a King.I say that the country people sought his help, for he spent his time, orappeared to spend it, in collecting herbs and simples on the hillsides,which he carried home with him to his dark abode, and distilledmedicines and potions from them, which he sold to his neighbours atwondrous high prices.He was also the possessor of a wonderful leathern-covered book, claspedwith clasps of brass, over which he would pore for hours together, andout of which he would tell the simple Islanders their fortunes, if theywould.For they feared the book almost as much as they feared Snorro himself,for it was whispered that it had once belonged to Odin, and they crossedthemselves for protection as they named the mighty Enchanter."
the-dwarfie-stone,3,"But all the time they never guessed the real reason why Snorro chose tolive in the Dwarfie Stone.I will tell you why he did so. Not very far from the Stone there was acurious hill, shaped exactly like a wart. It was known as the Wart Hillof Hoy, and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden awonderful carbuncle, which, when it was found, would bestow on itsfinder marvellous magic gifts--Health, Wealth, and Happiness.Everything, in fact, that a human being could desire.And the curious thing about this carbuncle was, that it was said that itcould be seen at certain times, if only the people who were looking forit were at the right spot at the right moment.Now Snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone,so, while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great bookor distilling medicines from his herbs, he was really keeping a keenlook-out during his wanderings, noting every tuft of grass or piece ofrock under which it might be hidden. And at night, when everyone elsewas asleep, he would creep out, with pickaxe and spade, to turn over therocks or dig over the turf, in the hope of finding the long-sought-fortreasure underneath them."
the-dwarfie-stone,4,"He was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey-headed Raven, who lived in the cave along with him, and who was his bosom friend and companion. The Islanders feared this bird of ill omen asmuch, perhaps, as they feared its Master; for, although they went toconsult Snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities, and boughtmedicines and love-potions from him, they always looked upon him with acertain dread, feeling that there was something weird and uncanny abouthim.Now, at the time we are speaking of, Orkney was governed by two Earls,who were half-brothers. Paul, the elder, was a tall, handsome man, withdark hair, and eyes like sloes. All the country people loved him, for hewas so skilled in knightly exercises, and had such a sweet and lovingnature, that no one could help being fond of him. Old people's eyeswould brighten at the sight of him, and the little children would runout to greet him as he rode by their mothers' doors.And this was the more remarkable because, with all his winning manner,he had such a lack of conversation that men called him Paul the Silent,or Paul the Taciturn."
the-dwarfie-stone,5,"Harold, on the other hand, was as different from his brother as night isfrom day. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, and he had gained forhimself the name of Harold the Orator, because he was always free ofspeech and ready with his tongue.But for all this he was not a favourite. For he was haughty, andjealous, and quick-tempered, and the old folks' eyes did not brighten atthe sight of him, and the babes, instead of toddling out to greet him,hid their faces in their mothers' skirts when they saw him coming.Harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brotherbest, and the knowledge made him jealous of him, so a coldness sprang upbetween them.Now it chanced, one summer, that Earl Harold went on a visit to the Kingof Scotland, accompanied by his mother, the Countess Helga, and hersister, the Countess Fraukirk."
the-dwarfie-stone,6,"And while he was at Court he met a charming young Irish lady, the LadyMorna, who had come from Ireland to Scotland to attend upon the ScottishQueen. She was so sweet, and good, and gentle that Earl Harold's heartwas won, and he made up his mind that she, and only she, should be hisbride.But although he had paid her much attention, Lady Morna had sometimescaught glimpses of his jealous temper; she had seen an evil expressionin his eyes, and had heard him speak sharply to his servants, and shehad no wish to marry him. So, to his great amazement, she refused thehonour which he offered her, and told him that she would prefer toremain as she was.Earl Harold ground his teeth in silent rage, but he saw that it was nouse pressing his suit at that moment. So what he could not obtain by hisown merits he determined to obtain by guile.Accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the Lady Morna to go backwith them on a visit, hoping that when she was alone with him in Orkney,he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him, and induce herto become his wife. And all the while he never remembered his brotherPaul; or, if he did, he never thought it possible that he could be hisrival."
the-dwarfie-stone,7,"But that was just the very thing that happened. The Lady Morna, thinking
no evil, accepted the Countess Helga's invitation, and no sooner had the
party arrived back in Orkney than Paul, charmed with the grace and
beauty of the fair Irish Maiden, fell head over ears in love with her.
And the Lady Morna, from the very first hour that she saw him, returned
his love.

Of course this state of things could not long go on hidden, and when
Harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds.
Seizing a dagger, he rushed up to the turret where his brother was
sitting in his private apartments, and threatened to stab him to the
heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the
lovely stranger.

But Paul met him with pleasant words.

""Calm thyself, Brother,"" he said. ""It is true that I love the lady, but
that is no proof that I shall win her. Is it likely that she will choose
me, whom all men name Paul the Silent, when she hath the chance of
marrying you, whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the
proud title of Harold the Orator?"""
the-dwarfie-stone,8,"At these words Harold's vanity was flattered, and he thought that, afterall, his step-brother was right, and that he had a very small chance,with his meagre gift of speech, of being successful in his suit. So hethrew down his dagger, and, shaking hands with him, begged him topardon his unkind thoughts, and went down the winding stair again inhigh good-humour with himself and all the world.By this time it was coming near to the Feast of Yule, and at thatFestival it was the custom for the Earl and his Court to leave Kirkwallfor some weeks, and go to the great Palace of Orphir, nine milesdistant. And in order to see that everything was ready, Earl Paul tookhis departure some days before the others.The evening before he left he chanced to find the Lady Morna sittingalone in one of the deep windows of the great hall. She had beenweeping, for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure;and at the sight of her distress the kind-hearted young Earl could nolonger contain himself, but, folding her in his arms, he whispered toher how much he loved her, and begged her to promise to be his wife."
the-dwarfie-stone,9,"She agreed willingly. Hiding her rosy face on his shoulder, sheconfessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she hadseen him; and ever since that moment she had determined that, if shecould not wed him, she would wed no other man.For a little time they sat together, rejoicing in their new-foundhappiness. Then Earl Paul sprang to his feet.""Let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother,"" he said.""Harold may be disappointed at first, for I know, Sweetheart, he wouldfain have had thee for his own. But his good heart will soon overcomeall that, and he will rejoice with us also.""But the Lady Morna shook her head. She knew, better than her lover, whatEarl Harold's feeling would be; and she would fain put off the evilhour."
the-dwarfie-stone,10,"""Let us hold our peace till after Yule,"" she pleaded. ""It will be a joyto keep our secret to ourselves for a little space; there will be timeenough then to let all the world know.""Rather reluctantly, Earl Paul agreed; and next day he set off for thePalace at Orphir, leaving his lady-love behind him.Little he guessed the danger he was in! For, all unknown to him, hisstep-aunt, Countess Fraukirk, had chanced to be in the hall, the eveningbefore, hidden behind a curtain, and she had overheard every word thatMorna and he had spoken, and her heart was filled with black rage.For she was a hard, ambitious woman, and she had always hated the youngEarl, who was no blood-relation to her, and who stood in the way of hisbrother, her own nephew; for, if Paul were only dead, Harold would bethe sole Earl of Orkney.And now that he had stolen the heart of the Lady Morna, whom her ownnephew loved, her hate and anger knew no bounds. She had hastened off toher sister's chamber as soon as the lovers had parted; and there the twowomen had remained talking together till the chilly dawn broke in thesky."
the-dwarfie-stone,11,"Countess Fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every
word.]

Next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that
separates Pomona (on the mainland) from Hoy. In it sat a woman, but who
she was, or what she was like, no one could say, for she was covered
from head to foot with a black cloak, and her face was hidden behind a
thick, dark veil.

Snorro the Dwarf knew her, even before she laid aside her trappings, for
Countess Fraukirk was no stranger to him. In the course of her long life
she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil
deeds, and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold.
He therefore welcomed her gladly; but when he had heard the nature of
her errand his smiling face grew grave again, and he shook his head.

""I have served thee well, Lady, in the past,"" he said, ""but methinks
that this thing goeth beyond my courage. For to compass an Earl's death
is a weighty matter, especially when he is so well beloved as is the
Earl Paul.""

""Thou knowest why I have taken up my abode in this lonely spot--how I
hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle. Thou knowest also how
the people fear me, and hate me too, forsooth. And if the young Earl
died, and suspicion fell on me, I must needs fly the Island, for my life
would not be worth a grain of sand. Then my chance of success would be
gone. Nay! I cannot do it, Lady; I cannot do it."""
the-dwarfie-stone,12,"But the wily Countess offered him much gold, and bribed him higher andhigher, first with wealth, then with success, and lastly she promised toobtain for him a high post at the Court of the King of Scotland; and atthat his ambition stirred within him, his determination gave way, and heconsented to do what she asked.""I will summon my magic loom,"" he said, ""and weave a piece of cloth offinest texture and of marvellous beauty; and before I weave it I will sopoison the thread with a magic potion that, when it is fashioned into agarment, whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes.""""Thou art a clever knave,"" answered the Countess, a cruel smile lightingup her evil face, ""and thou shalt be rewarded. Let me have a couple ofyards of this wonderful web, and I will make a bonnie waistcoat for myfine young Earl and give it to him as a Yuletide gift. Then I reckonthat he will not see the year out.""""That will he not,"" said Dwarf Snorro, with a malicious grin; and thetwo parted, after arranging that the piece of cloth should be deliveredat the Palace of Orphir on the day before Christmas Eve."
the-dwarfie-stone,13,"Now, when the Countess Fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand,strange things were happening at the Castle at Kirkwall. For Harold,encouraged by his brother's absence, offered his heart and hand oncemore to the Lady Morna. Once more she refused him, and in order to makesure that the scene should not be repeated, she told him that she hadplighted her troth to his brother. When he heard that this was so, rageand fury were like to devour him. Mad with anger, he rushed from herpresence, flung himself upon his horse, and rode away in the directionof the sea shore.While he was galloping wildly along, his eyes fell on the snow-cladhills of Hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the oneisland from the other. And his thoughts flew at once to Snorro theDwarf, who he had had occasion, as well as his step-aunt, to visit inbygone days.""I have it,"" he cried. ""Stupid fool that I was not to think of it atonce. I will go to Snorro, and buy from him a love-potion, which willmake my Lady Morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindlytowards me."""
the-dwarfie-stone,14,"So he made haste to hire a boat, and soon he was speeding over thetossing waters on his way to the Island of Hoy. When he arrived there hehurried up the lonely valley to where the Dwarfie Stone stood, and hehad no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant, for Snorro wasstanding at the hole that served as a door, his raven on his shoulder,gazing placidly at the setting sun.A curious smile crossed his face when, hearing the sound of approachingfootsteps, he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble.""What bringeth thee here, Sir Earl?"" he asked gaily, for he scented moregold.""I come for a love-potion,"" said Harold; and without more ado he toldthe whole story to the Wizard. ""I will pay thee for it,"" he added, ""ifthou wilt give it to me quickly.""Snorro looked at him from head to foot. ""Blind must the maiden be, SirOrator,"" he said, ""who needeth a love-potion to make her fancy sogallant a Knight.""Earl Harold laughed angrily. ""It is easier to catch a sunbeam than awoman's roving fancy,"" he replied. ""I have no time for jesting. For,hearken, old man, there is a proverb that saith, 'Time and tide wait forno man,' so I need not expect the tide to wait for me. The potion I musthave, and that instantly."""
the-dwarfie-stone,15,"Snorro saw that he was in earnest, so without a word he entered hisdwelling, and in a few minutes returned with a small phial in his hand,which was full of a rosy liquid.""Pour the contents of this into the Lady Morna's wine-cup,"" he said,""and I warrant thee that before four-and-twenty hours have passed shewill love thee better than thou lovest her now.""Then he waved his hand, as if to dismiss his visitor, and disappearedinto his dwelling-place.Earl Harold made all speed back to the Castle; but it was not until oneor two days had elapsed that he found a chance to pour the love-potioninto the Lady Morna's wine-cup. But at last, one night at supper, hefound an opportunity of doing so, and, waving away the little page-boy,he handed it to her himself."
the-dwarfie-stone,16,"She raised it to her lips, but she only made a pretence at drinking, forshe had seen the hated Earl fingering the cup, and she feared some deedof treachery. When he had gone back to his seat she managed to pour thewhole of the wine on the floor, and smiled to herself at the look ofsatisfaction that came over Harold's face as she put down the emptycup.His satisfaction increased, for from that moment she felt so afraid ofhim that she treated him with great kindness, hoping that by doing soshe would keep in his good graces until the Court moved to Orphir, andher own true love could protect her.Harold, on his side, was delighted with her graciousness, for he feltcertain that the charm was beginning to work, and that his hopes wouldsoon be fulfilled.A week later the Court removed to the Royal Palace at Orphir, where EarlPaul had everything in readiness for the reception of his guests."
the-dwarfie-stone,17,"Of course he was overjoyed to meet Lady Morna again, and she wasoverjoyed to meet him, for she felt that she was now safe from theunwelcome attentions of Earl Harold.But to Earl Harold the sight of their joy was as gall and bitterness,and he could scarcely contain himself, although he still trusted in theefficacy of Snorro the Dwarf's love-potion.As for Countess Fraukirk and Countess Helga, they looked forward eagerlyto the time when the magic web would arrive, out of which they hoped tofashion a fatal gift for Earl Paul.At last, the day before Christmas Eve, the two wicked women were sittingin the Countess Helga's chamber talking of the time when Earl Haroldwould rule alone in Orkney, when a tap came to the window, and onlooking round they saw Dwarf Snorro's grey-headed Raven perched on thesill, a sealed packet in its beak."
the-dwarfie-stone,18,"They opened the casement, and with a hoarse croak the creature let the
packet drop on to the floor; then it flapped its great wings and rose
slowly into the air again its head turned in the direction of Hoy.

With fingers that trembled with excitement they broke the seals and
undid the packet. It contained a piece of the most beautiful material
that anyone could possibly imagine, woven in all the colours of the
rainbow, and sparkling with gold and jewels.

""Twill make a bonnie waistcoat,"" exclaimed Countess Fraukirk, with an
unholy laugh. ""The Silent Earl will be a braw man when he gets it on.""

Then, without more ado, they set to work to cut out and sew the garment.
All that night they worked, and all next day, till, late in the
afternoon, when they were putting in the last stitches, hurried
footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase, and Earl Harold
burst open the door."
the-dwarfie-stone,19,"His cheeks were red with passion, and his eyes were bright, for he couldnot but notice that, now that she was safe at Orphir under her truelove's protection, the Lady Morna's manner had grown cold and distantagain, and he was beginning to lose faith in Snorro's charm.Angry and disappointed, he had sought his mother's room to pour out hisstory of vexation to her.He stopped short, however, when he saw the wonderful waistcoat lying onthe table, all gold and silver and shining colours. It was like a fairygarment, and its beauty took his breath away."
the-dwarfie-stone,20,"""For whom hast thou purchased that?"" he asked, hoping to hear that it
was intended for him.

""Tis a Christmas gift for thy brother Paul,"" answered his mother, and
she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was, had he
given her time to speak. But her words fanned his fury into madness, for
it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything.

""Everything is for Paul! I am sick of his very name,"" he cried. ""By my
troth, he shall not have this!"" and he snatched the vest from the table.

It was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his
feet, begging him to lay it down, and warning him that there was not a
thread in it which was not poisoned. He paid no heed to their words, but
rushed from the room, and, drawing it on, ran downstairs with a reckless
laugh, to show the Lady Morna how fine he was."
the-dwarfie-stone,21,"Alas! alas! Scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in
great pain.

Everyone crowded round him, and the two Countesses, terrified now by
what they had done, tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body.
But he felt that it was too late, the deadly poison had done its work,
and, waving them aside, he turned to his brother, who, in great
distress, had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms.

""I wronged thee, Paul,"" he gasped. ""For thou hast ever been true and
kind. Forgive me in thy thoughts, and,"" he added, gathering up his
strength for one last effort, and pointing to the two wretched women who
had wrought all this misery, ""_Beware of those two women_, for they
seek to take thy life."" Then his head sank back on his brother's
shoulder, and, with one long sigh, he died.

When he learned what had happened, and understood where the waistcoat
came from, and for what purpose it had been intended, the anger of the
Silent Earl knew no bounds. He swore a great oath that he would be
avenged, not only on Snorro the Dwarf, but also on his wicked
step-mother and her cruel sister."
the-dwarfie-stone,22,"His vengeance was baulked, however, for in the panic and confusion that
followed Harold's death, the two Countesses slipped out of the Palace
and fled to the coast, and took boat in haste to Scotland, where they
had great possessions, and where they were much looked up to, and where
no one would believe a word against them.

But retribution fell on them in the end, as it always does fall, sooner
or later, on everyone who is wicked, or selfish, or cruel; for the
Norsemen invaded the land, and their Castle was set on fire, and they
perished miserably in the flames.

When Earl Paul found that they had escaped, he set out in hot haste for
the Island of Hoy, for he was determined that the Dwarf, at least,
should not escape. But when he came to the Dwarfie Stone he found it
silent and deserted, all trace of its uncanny occupants having
disappeared."
the-dwarfie-stone,23,"No one knew what had become of them; a few people were inclined to think that the Dwarf and his Raven had accompanied the Countess Fraukirk and the Countess Helga on their flight, but the greater part of the
Islanders held to the belief, which I think was the true one, that the
Powers of the Air spirited Snorro away, and shut him up in some unknown
place as a punishment for his wickedness, and that his Raven accompanied
him.

At any rate, he was never seen again by any living person, and wherever
he went, he lost all chance of finding the magic carbuncle.

As for the Silent Earl and his Irish Sweetheart, they were married as
soon as Earl Harold's funeral was over; and for hundreds of years
afterwards, when the inhabitants of the Orkney Isles wanted to express
great happiness, they said, ""As happy as Earl Paul and the Countess
Morna."""
the-enchanted-deer,1,"A young man was out walking one day in Erin, leading a stout cart-horseby the bridle. He was thinking of his mother and how poor they weresince his father, who was a fisherman, had been drowned at sea, andwondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them. Suddenlya hand was laid on his shoulder, and a voice said to him:'Will you sell me your horse, son of the fisherman?' and looking up hebeheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand, a falcon onhis shoulder, and a dog by his side.'What will you give me for my horse?' asked the youth. 'Will you give meyour gun, and your dog, and your falcon?'"
the-enchanted-deer,2,"'I will give them,' answered the man, and he took the horse, and theyouth took the gun and the dog and the falcon, and went home with them.But when his mother heard what he had done she was very angry, and beathim with a stick which she had in her hand.'That will teach you to sell my property,' said she, when her arm wasquite tired, but Ian her son answered her nothing, and went off to hisbed, for he was very sore.That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him.'I will not stay here to be beaten,' thought he, and he walked andhe walked and he walked, till it was day again, and he was hungry andlooked about him to see if he could get anything to eat. Not very faroff was a farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at the door, and thefarmer and his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast."
the-enchanted-deer,3,"'Ah, you have a gun,' said the farmer as the young man placed it in acorner. 'That is well, for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn,and I cannot catch it. It is fortune that has sent you to me.''I will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you,' replied the youth,and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to thecornfield; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just goingto pull the trigger, when, behold! instead of a deer, a woman with longblack hair was standing there. At this sight his gun almost dropped fromhis hand in surprise, but as he looked, there was the deer eating thecorn again. And thrice this happened, till the deer ran away over themoor, and the young man after her."
the-enchanted-deer,4,"On they went, on and on and one, till they reached a cottage which wasthatched with heather. With a bound the deer sprang on the roof, and laydown where none could see her, but as she did so she called out, 'Go in,fisher's son, and eat and drink while you may.' So he entered and foundfood and wine on the table, but no man, for the house belonged to somerobbers, who were still away at their wicked business.After Ian, the fisher's son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himselfbehind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men comingthrough the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet.From his dark corner he could see into the room, and he counted four andtwenty of them, all big, cross-looking men.'Some one has been eating our dinner,' cried they, 'and there was hardlyenough for ourselves.'"
the-enchanted-deer,5,"'It is the man who is lying under the cask,' answered the leader. 'Goand kill him, and then come and eat your food and sleep, for we must beoff betimes in the morning.'So four of them killed the fisher's son and left him, and then went tobed.By sunrise they were all out of the house, for they had far to go. Andwhen they had disappeared the deer came off the roof, to where the deadman lay, and she shook her head over him, and wax fell from her ear, andhe jumped up as well as ever."
the-enchanted-deer,6,"'Trust me and eat as you did before, and no harm shall happen to you,'said she. So Ian ate and drank, and fell sound asleep under the cask.In the evening the robbers arrived very tired, and crosser than theyhad been yesterday, for their luck had turned and they had brought backscarcely anything.'Someone has eaten our dinner again,' cried they.'It is the man under the barrel,' answered the captain. 'Let four of yougo and kill him, but first slay the other four who pretended to kill himlast night and didn't because he is still alive.'"
the-enchanted-deer,7,"Then Ian was killed a second time, and after the rest of the robbers hadeaten, they lay down and slept till morning.No sooner were their faces touched with the sun's rays than they were upand off. Then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the deadman, and he was as well as ever. By this time he did not mind whatbefell him, so sure was he that the deer would take care of him, andin the evening that which had happened before happened again--the fourrobbers were put to death and the fisher's son also, but because therewas no food left for them to eat, they were nearly mad with rage, andbegan to quarrel. From quarrelling they went on to fighting, and foughtso hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor.Then the deer entered, and the fisher's son was restored to life, andbidding him follow her, she ran on to a little white cottage where dweltan old woman and her son, who was thin and dark."
the-enchanted-deer,8,"'Here I must leave you,' said the deer, 'but to-morrow meet me atmidday in the church that is yonder.' And jumping across the stream, shevanished into a wood.Next day he set out for the church, but the old woman of the cottage hadgone before him, and had stuck an enchanted stick called 'the spike ofhurt' in a crack of the door, so that he would brush against it as hestepped across the threshold. Suddenly he felt so sleepy that he couldnot stand up, and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deepslumber, not knowing that the dark lad was watching him. Nothing couldwaken him, not even the sound of sweetest music, nor the touch of a ladywho bent over him. A sad look came on her face, as she saw it was nouse, and at last she gave it up, and lifting his arm, wrote her nameacross the side--'the daughter of the king of the town under thewaves.''I will come to-morrow,' she whispered, though he could not hear her,and she went sorrowfully away."
the-enchanted-deer,9,"Then he awoke, and the dark lad told him what had befallen him, and hewas very grieved. But the dark lad did not tell him of the name that waswritten underneath his arm.On the following morning the fisher's son again went to the church,determined that he would not go to sleep, whatever happened. But in hishurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt, and sank downwhere he stood, wrapped in slumber. A second time the air was filledwith music, and the lady came in, stepping softly, but though she laidhis head on her knee, and combed his hair with a golden comb, his eyesopened not. Then she burst into tears, and placing a beautifully wroughtbox in his pocket she went her way.The next day the same thing befell the fisher's son, and this timethe lady wept more bitterly than before, for she said it was the lastchance, and she would never be allowed to come any more, for home shemust go."
the-enchanted-deer,10,"As soon as the lady had departed the fisher's son awoke, and the darklad told him of her visit, and how he would never see her as long as helived. At this the fisher's son felt the cold creeping up to his heart,yet he knew the fault had not been his that sleep had overtaken him.'I will search the whole world through till I find her,' cried he, andthe dark lad laughed as he heard him. But the fisher's son took no heed,and off he went, following the sun day after day, till his shoes were inholes and his feet were sore from the journey. Nought did he see butthe birds that made their nests in the trees, not so much as a goat ora rabbit. On and on and on he went, till suddenly he came upon a littlehouse, with a woman standing outside it."
the-enchanted-deer,11,"'All hail, fisher's son!' said she. 'I know what you are seeking; enterin and rest and eat, and to-morrow I will give you what help I can, andsend you on your way.'Gladly did Ian the fisher's son accept her offer, and all that day herested, and the woman gave him ointment to put on his feet, which healedhis sores. At daybreak he got up, ready to be gone, and the woman badehim farewell, saying:'I have a sister who dwells on the road which you must travel. It is along road, and it would take you a year and a day to reach it, but puton these old brown shoes with holes all over them, and you will be therebefore you know it. Then shake them off, and turn their toes to theknown, and their heels to the unknown, and they will come home ofthemselves.'"
the-enchanted-deer,12,"The fisher's son did as the woman told him, and everything happened justas she had said. But at parting the second sister said to him, as shegave him another pair of shoes:'Go to my third sister, for she has a son who is keeper of the birds ofthe air, and sends them to sleep when night comes. He is very wise, andperhaps he can help you.'Then the young man thanked her, and went to the third sister."
the-enchanted-deer,13,"The third sister was very kind, but had no counsel to give him, so heate and drank and waited till her son came home, after he had sent allthe birds to sleep. He thought a long while after his mother had toldhim the young man's story, and at last he said that he was hungry, andthe cow must be killed, as he wanted some supper. So the cow was killedand the meat cooked, and a bag made of its red skin.'Now get into the bag,' bade the son, and the young man got in and tookhis gun with him, but the dog and the falcon he left outside. The keeperof the birds drew the string at the top of the bag, and left it tofinish his supper, when in flew an eagle through the open door, andpicked the bag up in her claws and carried it through the air to anisland. There was nothing to eat on the island, and the fisher's sonthought he would die of food, when he remembered the box that the ladyhad put in his pocket. He opened the lid, and three tiny little birdsflew out, and flapping their wings they asked,'Good master, is there anything we can do for thee?'"
the-enchanted-deer,14,"'Bear me to the kingdom of the king under the waves,' he answered, andone little bird flew on to his head, and the others perched on each ofhis shoulders, and he shut his eyes, and in a moment there he was inthe country under the sea. Then the birds flew away, and the young manlooked about him, his heart beating fast at the thought that here dweltthe lady whom he had sought all the world over.He walked on through the streets, and presently he reached the house ofa weaver who was standing at his door, resting from his work.'You are a stranger here, that is plain,' said the weaver, 'but come in,and I will give you food and drink.' And the young man was glad, for heknew not where to go, and they sat and talked till it grew late."
the-enchanted-deer,15,"'Stay with me, I pray, for I love company and am lonely,' observed theweaver at last, and he pointed to a bed in a corner, where the fisher'sson threw himself, and slept till dawn.'There is to be a horse-race in the town to-day,' remarked the weaver,'and the winner is to have the king's daughter to wife.' The youngman trembled with excitement at the news, and his voice shook as heanswered:'That will be a prize indeed, I should like to see the race.''Oh, that is quite easy--anyone can go,' replied the weaver. 'I wouldtake you myself, but I have promised to weave this cloth for the king.'"
the-enchanted-deer,16,"'That is a pity,' returned the young man politely, but in his heart herejoiced, for he wished to be alone.Leaving the house, he entered a grove of trees which stood behind, andtook the box from his pocket. He raised the lid, and out flew the threelittle birds.'Good master, what shall we do for thee?' asked they, and he answered,'Bring me the finest horse that ever was seen, and the grandest dress,and glass shoes.''They are here, master,' said the birds, and so they were, and never hadthe young man seen anything so splendid."
the-enchanted-deer,17,"Mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses wereassembling for the great race, and took his place among them. Manygood beasts were there which had won many races, but the horse of thefisher's son left them all behind, and he was first at the winning post.The king's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize, forhe went back to the wood, and got off his horse, and put on his oldclothes, and bade the box place some gold in his pockets. After thathe went back to the weaver's house, and told him that the gold had beengiven him by the man who had won the race, and that the weaver mighthave it for his kindness to him.Now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess, the kingordered another race to be run, and the fisher's son rode into the fieldstill more splendidly dressed than he was before, and easily distancedeverybody else. But again he left the prize unclaimed, and so ithappened on the third day, when it seemed as if all the people inthe kingdom were gathered to see the race, for they were filled withcuriosity to know who the winner could be."
the-enchanted-deer,18,"'If he will not come of his own free will, he must be brought,' said theking, and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sentto seek him in every street of the town. This took many days, and whenat last they found the young man in the weaver's cottage, he was sodirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance, that they declared hecould not be the winner they had been searching for, but a wicked robberwho had murdered ever so many people, but had always managed to escape.'Yes, it must be the robber,' said the king, when the fisher's son wasled into his presence; 'build a gallows at once and hang him in thesight of all my subjects, that they may behold him suffer the punishmentof his crimes.'"
the-enchanted-deer,19,"So the gallows was built upon a high platform, and the fisher's sonmounted the steps up to it, and turned at the top to make the speechthat was expected from every doomed man, innocent or guilt. As he spokehe happened to raise his arm, and the king's daughter, who was there ather father's side, saw the name which she had written under it. Witha shriek she sprang from her seat, and the eyes of the spectators wereturned towards her.'Stop! stop!' she cried, hardly knowing what she said. 'If that manis hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also.' Andrunning up to where the fisher's son was standing, she took him by thehand, saying,'Father, this is no robber or murderer, but the victor in the threeraces, and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me.'"
the-enchanted-deer,20,"Then, without waiting for a reply, she conducted him into the palace,and he bathed in a marble bath, and all the dirt that the fairies hadput upon him disappeared like magic, and when he had dressed himself inthe fine garments the princess had sent to him, he looked a match forany king's daughter in Erin. He went down into the great hall where shewas awaiting him, and they had much to tell each other but littletime to tell it in, for the king her father, and the princes who werevisiting him, and all the people of the kingdom were still in theirplaces expecting her return.'How did you find me out?' she whispered as they went down the passage."
the-enchanted-deer,21,"'The birds in the box told me,' answered he, but he could say no more,as they stepped out into the open space that was crowded with people.There the princes stopped.'O kings!' she said, turning towards them, 'if one of you were killedto-day, the rest would fly; but this man put his trust in me, and hadhis head cut off three times. Because he has done this, I will marry himrather than one of you, who have come hither to wed me, for many kingshere sought to free me from the spells, but none could do it save Ianthe fisher's son.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,1,"The king had just awakened from his midday sleep, for it was summer, andeveryone rose early and rested from twelve to three, as they do in hotcountries. He had dressed himself in cool white clothes, and was passingthrough the hall on his way to the council chamber, when a number ofyoung nobles suddenly appeared before him, and one amongst them steppedforward and spoke.'Sire, this morning we were all playing tennis in the court, the princeand this gentleman with the rest, when there broke out some disputeabout the game. The prince lost his temper, and said many insultingthings to the other, who was playing against him, till at length thegentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face, so thatthe blood ran from his mouth and nose. We were all so horrified at thesight, that we should most likely have killed the man then and there,for daring to lay hands on the prince, had not his grandfather the dukestepped between and commanded us to lay the affair before you.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,2,"The king had listened attentively to the story, and when it was ended hesaid:'I suppose the prince had no arms with him, or else he would have usedthem?''Yes, sire, he had arms; he always carries a dagger in his belt. Butwhen he saw the blood pouring from his face, he went to a corner of thecourt and began to cry, which was the strangest thing of all.'On hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a fewminutes with his back to the room, where the company of young menremained silent. Then he came back, his face white and stern.'I tell you,' he said, 'and it is the solemn truth, that I would ratheryou had told me that the prince was dead, though he is my only son, thanknow that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avengeit. As for the gentleman who struck him, he will be brought before myjudges, and will plead his own cause, but I hardly think he can escapedeath, after having assaulted the heir to the crown.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,3,"The young man raised his head as if to reply, but the king would notlisten, and commanded his guards to put him under arrest, adding,however, that if the prisoner wished to visit any part of the city, hewas at liberty to do so properly guarded, and in fifteen days he wouldbe brought to trial before the highest judges in the land.The young man left the king's presence, surrounded by soldiers, andaccompanied by many of his friends, for he was a great favourite. Bytheir advice he spent the fourteen days that remained to him going aboutto seek counsel from wise men of all sorts, as to how he might escapedeath, but no one could help him, for none could find any excuse for theblow he had given to the prince.The fourteenth night had come, and in despair the prisoner went out totake his last walk through the city. He wandered on hardly knowingwhere he went, and his face was so white and desperate that none of hiscompanions dared speak to him. The sad little procession had passed somehours in this manner, when, near the gate of a monastery, an old womanappeared round a corner, and suddenly stood before the young man. Shewas bent almost double, and was so wizened and wrinkled that she lookedat least ninety; only her eyes were bright and quick as those of a girl."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,4,"'Sir,' she said, 'I know all that has happened to you, and how you areseeking if in any wise you can save your life. But there is none thatcan answer that question save only I myself, if you will promise to doall I ask.'At her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolledoff him.'Oh, save me, and I will do anything!' he cried. 'It is so hard to leavethe world and go out into the darkness.''You will not need to do that,' answered the old woman, 'you have onlygot to marry me, and you will soon be free.''Marry you?' exclaimed he, 'but--but--I am not yet twenty, and you--why, you must be a hundred at least! Oh, no, it is quite impossible.'He spoke without thinking, but the flash of anger which darted from hereyes made him feel uncomfortable. However, all she said was:'As you like; since you reject me, let the crows have you,' and hurriedaway down the street."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,5,"Left to himself, the full horror of his coming death rushed upon theyoung man, and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance oflife. Well, if he must, he must, he said to himself, and began to run asfast as he could after the old crone, who by this time could scarcely beseen, even in the moonlight. Who would have believed a woman past ninetycould walk with such speed? It seemed more like flying! But at length,breathless and exhausted, he reached her side, and gasped out:'Madam, pardon me for my hasty words just now; I was wrong, and willthankfully accept the offer you made me.''Ah, I thought you would come to your senses,' answered she, in ratheran odd voice. 'We have no time to lose--follow me at once,' and theywent on silently and swiftly till they stopped at the door of a smallhouse in which the priest lived. Before him the old woman bade theprisoner swear that she should be his wife, and this he did in thepresence of witnesses. Then, begging the priest and the guards to leavethem alone for a little, she told the young man what he was to do, whenthe next morning he was brought before the king and the judges."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,6,"The hall was full to overflowing when the prisoner entered it, and allmarvelled at the brightness of his face. The king inquired if he had anyexcuse to plead for the high treason he had committed by striking theheir to the throne, and, if so, to be quick in setting it forth. With alow bow the youth made answer in a clear voice:'O my lord and gracious king, and you, nobles and wise men of the land,I leave my cause without fear in your hands, knowing that you willlisten and judge rightly, and that you will suffer me to speak to theend, before you give judgment.''For four years, you, O king, had been married to the queen and yet hadno children, which grieved you greatly. The queen saw this, and likewisethat your love was going from her, and thought night and day of someplan that might put an end to this evil. At length, when you wereaway fighting in distant countries, she decided what she would do, andadopted in secret the baby of a poor quarryman, sending a messenger totell you that you had a son. No one suspected the truth except a priestto whom the queen confessed the truth, and in a few weeks she fell illand died, leaving the baby to be brought up as became a prince. And now,if your highness will permit me, I will speak of myself.''What you have already told me,' answered the king, 'is so strange thatI cannot imagine what more there is to tell, but go on with your story.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,7,"'One day, shortly after the death of the queen,' continued the youngman, 'your highness was hunting, and outstripped all your attendantswhile chasing the deer. You were in a part of the country which you didnot know, so seeing an orchard all pink and white with apple-blossoms,and a girl tossing a ball in one corner, you went up to her to ask yourway. But when she turned to answer you, you were so struck with herbeauty that all else fled from your mind. Again and again you rode backto see her, and at length persuaded her to marry you. She only thoughtyou a poor knight, and agreed that as you wished it, the marriage shouldbe kept secret.''After the ceremony you gave her three rings and a charm with a crosson it, and then put her in a cottage in the forest, thinking to hide thematter securely.''For some months you visited the cottage every week; but a rebellionbroke out in a distant part of the kingdom, and called for yourpresence. When next you rode up to the cottage, it was empty, and nonecould inform you whither your bride had gone. That, sire, I can nowtell you,' and the young man paused and looked at the king, whocoloured deeply. 'She went back to her father the old duke, once yourchamberlain, and the cross on her breast revealed at once who you were.Fierce was his anger when he heard his daughter's tale, and he vowedthat he would hide her safely from you, till the day when you wouldclaim her publicly as your queen.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,8,"'By and bye I was born, and was brought up by my grandfather in one ofhis great houses. Here are the rings you gave to my mother, and here isthe cross, and these will prove if I am your son or not.'As he spoke the young man laid the jewels at the feet of the king, andthe nobles and the judges pressed round to examine them. The king alonedid not move from his seat, for he had forgotten the hall of justice andall about him, and saw only the apple-orchard, as it was twenty yearsago, and the beautiful girl playing at ball. A sudden silence round himmade him look up, and he found the eyes of the assembly fixed on him.'It is true; it is he who is my son, and not the other,' he said withan effort, 'and let every man present swear to acknowledge him as king,after my death.'Therefore one by one they all knelt before him and took the oath, anda message was sent to the false prince, forbidding him ever again toappear at court, though a handsome pension was granted him."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,9,"At last the ceremony was over, and the king, signing to his newly foundson to follow him, rose and went into another room.'Tell me how you knew all that,' he said, throwing himself into a carvedchair filled with crimson cushions, and the prince told of his meetingwith the old woman who had brought him the jewels from his mother, andhow he had sworn before a priest to marry her, though he did not want todo it, on account of the difference in their ages, and besides, he wouldrather receive a bride chosen by the king himself. But the king frowned,and answered sharply:'You swore to marry her if she saved your life, and, come what may,you must fulfil your promise.' Then, striking a silver shield that hungclose by, he said to the equerry who appeared immediately:'Go and seek the priest who lives near the door of the prison, and askhim where you can find the old woman who visited him last night; andwhen you have found her, bring her to the palace.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,10,"It took some time to discover the whereabouts of the old woman, but atlength it was accomplished, and when she arrived at the palace with theequerry, she was received with royal honours, as became the bride ofthe prince. The guards looked at each other with astonished eyes, as thewizened creature, bowed with age, passed between their lines; but theywere more amazed still at the lightness of her step as she skipped upthe steps to the great door before which the king was standing, with theprince at his side. If they both felt a shock at the appearance of theaged lady they did not show it, and the king, with a grave bow, took herband, and led her to the chapel, where a bishop was waiting to performthe marriage ceremony.For the next few weeks little was seen of the prince, who spent all hisdays in hunting, and trying to forget the old wife at home. As for theprincess, no one troubled himself about her, and she passed the daysalone in her apartments, for she had absolutely declined the services ofthe ladies-in-waiting whom the king had appointed for her."
the-false-prince-and-the-true,11,"One night the prince returned after a longer chase than usual, and hewas so tired that he went up straight to bed. Suddenly he was awakenedby a strange noise in the room, and suspecting that a robber might havestolen in, he jumped out of bed, and seized his sword, which lay readyto his hand. Then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the nextroom, which belonged to the princess, and was lighted by a burningtorch. Creeping softly to the door, he peeped through it, and beheldher lying quietly, with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head, herwrinkles all gone, and her face, which was whiter than the snow, asfresh as that of a girl of fourteen. Could that really be his wife--thatbeautiful, beautiful creature?The prince was still gazing in surprise when the lady opened her eyesand smiled at him.'Yes, I really am your wife,' she said, as if she had guessed histhoughts, 'and the enchantment is ended. Now I must tell you who I am,and what befell to cause me to take the shape of an old woman.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,12,"'The king of Granada is my father, and I was born in the palace whichoverlooks the plain of the Vega. I was only a few months old when awicked fairy, who had a spite against my parents, cast a spell overme, bending my back and wrinkling my skin till I looked as if I was ahundred years old, and making me such an object of disgust to everyone,that at length the king ordered my nurse to take my away from thepalace. She was the only person who cared about me, and we livedtogether in this city on a small pension allowed me by the king.''When I was about three an old man arrived at our house, and begged mynurse to let him come in and rest, as he could walk no longer. She sawthat he was very ill, so put him to bed and took such care of him thatby and bye he was as strong as ever. In gratitude for her goodness tohim, he told her that he was a wizard and could give her anything shechose to ask for, except life or death, so she answered that what shelonged for most in the world was that my wrinkled skin should disappear,and that I should regain the beauty with which I was born. To this hereplied that as my misfortune resulted from a spell, this was ratherdifficult, but he would do his best, and at any rate he could promisethat before my fifteenth birthday I should be freed from the enchantmentif I could get a man who would swear to marry me as I was.'"
the-false-prince-and-the-true,13,"'As you may suppose, this was not easy, as my ugliness was such thatno one would look at me a second time. My nurse and I were almost indespair, as my fifteenth birthday was drawing near, and I had never somuch as spoken to a man. At last we received a visit from the wizard,who told us what had happened at court, and your story, bidding me toput myself in your way when you had lost all hope, and offer to save youif you would consent to marry me.''That is my history, and now you must beg the king to send messengers atonce to Granada, to inform my father of our marriage, and I think,' sheadded with a smile, 'that he will not refuse us his blessing.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,1,"A young Prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him, when he came to a deep open ditch. He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch. He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from. To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch. The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there.

'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,2,"Then the Prince said to her, 'You can hardly walk; I will put you on my horse and lead you home. Where do you live?'

'Over there, at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance,' replied the old woman.

The Prince lifted her on to his horse, and soon they reached the hut, where the old woman got down, and turning to the Prince said, 'Just wait a moment, and I will give you something.' And she disappeared into her hut, but returned very soon and said, 'You are a mighty Prince, but at the same time you have a kind heart, which deserves to be rewarded. Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife?'

'Most certainly I would,' replied the Prince."
the-flower-queens-daughter,3,"So the old woman continued, 'The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers, who has been captured by a dragon. If you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this I will help you to do. I will give you this little bell: if you ring it once, the King of the Eagles will appear; if you ring it twice, the King of the Foxes will come to you; and if you ring it three times, you will see the King of the Fishes by your side. These will help you if you are in any difficulty. Now farewell, and heaven prosper your undertaking.' She handed him the little bell, and there disappeared hut and all, as though the earth had swallowed her up."
the-flower-queens-daughter,4,"When it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket, he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid.

So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home. He had roamed round the world for a whole year, and his horse had died of exhaustion, while he himself had suffered much from want and misery, but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of. At last one day he came to a hut, in front of which sat a very old man. The Prince asked him, 'Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,5,"'No, I do not,' answered the old man. 'But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you.'

The Prince thanked him for his information, and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut, where he found a very old man. He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. I know he can tell you.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,6,"And so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man. He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; but this time the old man answered, 'The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep. For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.'

So the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows. He opened the big gate leading into the courtyard, and was just going to walk in, when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted?"
the-flower-queens-daughter,7,"The Prince replied, 'I have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the Dragon's Mother, and would like to enter her service.'

This flattering speech pleased the dragons, and the eldest of them said, 'Well, you may come with me, and I will take you to the Mother Dragon.'

They entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls, all made of gold and diamonds. In the twelfth room they found the Mother Dragon seated on a diamond throne. She was the ugliest woman under the sun, and, added to it all, she had three heads. Her appearance was a great shock to the Prince, and so was her voice, which was like the croaking of many ravens. She asked him, 'Why have you come here?'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,8,"The Prince answered at once, 'I have heard so much of your beauty and kindness, that I would very much like to enter your service.'

'Very well,' said the Mother Dragon; 'but if you wish to enter my service, you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days; but if you don't bring her home safely every evening, we will eat you up.'

The Prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow."
the-flower-queens-daughter,9,"But no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished. The Prince sought for her in vain, and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate. As he sat thus lost in thought, he noticed an eagle flying over his head. Then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell, and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once. In a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him, and the King of the Eagles sank at his feet."
the-flower-queens-daughter,10,"'I know what you want of me,' the bird said. 'You are looking for the Mother Dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds. I will summon all the eagles of the air together, and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you.' And with these words the King of the Eagles flew away. Towards evening the Prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air, and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them. They sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him. Then the Prince rode home to the old Mother Dragon, who was full of wonder when she saw him, and said, 'You have succeeded to-day in looking after my mare, and as a reward you shall come to my ball to-night.' She gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper, and led him to a big room where several young he-dragons and she-dragons were dancing together. Here, too, was the Flower Queen's beautiful daughter. Her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world, and her complexion was like lilies and roses. As the Prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear, 'I have come to set you free!'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,11,"Then the beautiful girl said to him, 'If you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day, ask the Mother Dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward.'

The ball came to an end at midnight, and early next morning the Prince again led the Mother Dragon's mare out into the meadow. But again she vanished before his eyes. Then he took out his little bell and rang it twice.

In a moment the King of the Foxes stood before him and said: 'I know already what you want, and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,12,"With these words the King of the Foxes disappeared, and in the evening many thousand foxes brought the mare to the Prince.

Then he rode home to the Mother-Dragon, from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver, and again she led him to the ball-room.

The Flower Queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound, and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear: 'If you succeed again to-morrow, wait for me with the foal in the meadow. After the ball we will fly away together.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,13,"On the third day the Prince led the mare to the meadow again; but once more she vanished before his eyes. Then the Prince took out his little bell and rang it three times.

In a moment the King of the Fishes appeared, and said to him: 'I know quite well what you want me to do, and I will summon all the fishes of the sea together, and tell them to bring you back the mare, who is hiding herself in a river.'"
the-flower-queens-daughter,14,"Towards evening the mare was returned to him, and when he led her home to the Mother Dragon she said to him:

'You are a brave youth, and I will make you my body-servant. But what shall I give you as a reward to begin with?'

The Prince begged for a foal of the mare, which the Mother Dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty."
the-flower-queens-daughter,15,"So in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak; but before the entertainment was over he slipped away, and went straight to the stables, where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the Flower Queen's daughter. Towards midnight the beautiful girl appeared, and placing her in front of him on his horse, the Prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the Flower Queen's dwelling. But the dragons had noticed their flight, and woke their brother out of his year's sleep. He flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened, and determined to lay siege to the Flower Queen's palace; but the Queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling, through which no one could force a way."
the-flower-queens-daughter,16,"When the Flower Queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the Prince, she said to him: 'I will give my consent to your marriage gladly, but my daughter can only stay with you in summer. In winter, when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow, she must come and live with me in my palace underground.' The Prince consented to this, and led his beautiful bride home, where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence. The young couple lived happily together till winter came, when the Flower Queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother. In summer she returned to her husband, and their life of joy and happiness began again, and lasted till the approach of winter, when the Flower Queen's daughter went back again to her mother. This coming and going continued all her life long, and in spite of it they always lived happily together."
the-miserly-farmer,1,"Once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market.
Since they were very sweet and fragrant, he hoped to get a good price
for them. A bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his
cart and asked for one. The farmer repulsed him, but the bonze did not
go. Then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names. The bonze
said: ""You have pears by the hundred in your cart. I only ask for one.
Surely that does you no great injury. Why suddenly grow so angry about
it?"""
the-miserly-farmer,2,"The bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of
the smaller pears and let him go. But the farmer would not and did
not. An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the
noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear and gave it to
the bonze.

The bonze thanked him and said: ""One like myself, who has given up the
world, must not be miserly. I have beautiful pears myself, and I
invite you all to eat them with me."" Then some one asked: ""If you have
pears then why do you not eat your own?"" He answered: ""I first must
have a seed to plant."""
the-miserly-farmer,3,"And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto. When he had
finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his
shoulder; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep. Into this he thrust
the pit, and covered it with earth. Then he asked the folk in the
market place for water, with which to water it. A pair of curiosity
seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and
with it the bonze watered the pit. Thousands of eyes were turned on
the spot. And the pit could already be seen to sprout. The sprout grew
and in a moment it had turned into a tree. Branches and leaves
burgeoned out from it. It began to blossom and soon the fruit had
ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the
boughs. The bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to
the bystanders. In a moment all the pears had been eaten up. Then the
bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree. Crash, crash! so it went
for a while, and the tree was felled. Then he took the tree on his
shoulder and walked away at an easy gait."
the-miserly-farmer,4,"When the bonze had begun to make his magic, the farmer, too, had
mingled with the crowd. With neck outstretched and staring eyes he had
stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do
with his pears. When the bonze had gone off he turned around to look
after his cart. His pears had all disappeared. Then he realized that
the pears the bonze had divided had been his own. He looked more
closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared. It was plainly
evident that it had been chopped off quite recently. The farmer fell
into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could. And
when he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle
by the city wall. And then he realized that the pear-tree which the
bonze had chopped down must have been his axle. The bonze, however,
was nowhere to be found. And the whole crowd in the market burst out
into loud laughter."
the-sea-king-gift,1,"There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian namewas Matte. He lived by the shore of the big sea; where else could helive? He had a wife called Maie; could you find a better name for her?In winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in springthey flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the wholesummer until it was autumn. The cottage on the rock was even smallerthan the other; it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to thedoor, a stone hearth, a flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof.The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-placeof a town. Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and fouralder bushes. Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps theywere brought by the winter storms. Besides that, there flourished sometufts of velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellowherb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but thetreasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie hadput in a cleft. Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and thesun shone on them on the south. This does not seem much, but it sufficedMaie for a herb plot."
the-sea-king-gift,2,"All good things go in threes, so Matte and his wife fished for salmon inspring, for herring in summer, and for cod in winter. When on Saturdaysthe weather was fine and the wind favourable, they sailed to the nearesttown, sold their fish, and went to church on Sunday. But it oftenhappened that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rockAhtola, and had nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog,which bore the grand name of Prince, their grass tufts, their bushes andblooms, the sea bays and fish, a stormy sky and the blue, white-crestedwaves. For the rock lay far away from the land, and there were nogreen islets or human habitations for miles round, only here and thereappeared a rock of the same red stone as Ahtola, besprinkled day andnight with the ocean spray.Matte and Maie were industrious, hard-working folk, happy and contentedin their poor hut, and they thought themselves rich when they were ableto salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet havesome left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man, and a pound ortwo of coffee for his wife, with plenty of burned corn and chicory in itto give it a flavour. Besides that, they had bread, butter, fish, a beercask, and a buttermilk jar; what more did they require? All would havegone well had not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which neverlet her rest; and this was, how she could manage to become the owner ofa cow."
the-sea-king-gift,3,"'What would you do with a cow?' asked Matte. 'She could not swim so far,and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; and even if wehad her, we have nothing to feed her on.''We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,' rejoined Maie.'Yes, of course,' laughed Matte, 'and we have also three plants ofgarlic. Garlic would be fine feeding for her.''Every cow likes salt herring,' rejoined his wife. 'Even Prince is fondof fish.''That may be,' said her husband. 'Methinks she would soon be a dear cowif we had to feed her on salt herring. All very well for Prince, whofights with the gulls over the last morsel. Put the cow out of yourhead, mother, we are very well off as we are.'"
the-sea-king-gift,4,"Maie sighed. She knew well that her husband was right, but she could notgive up the idea of a cow. The buttermilk no longer tasted as good asusual in the coffee; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and ofhow there was nothing in the world to be compared with them.One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore theyheard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat withthree young men in it, steering towards the rock. They were students, ona boating excursion, and wanted to get something to eat.'Bring us a junket, good mother,' cried they to Maie.'Ah! if only I had such a thing!' sighed Maie.'A can of fresh milk, then,' said the students; 'but it must not beskim.''Yes, if only I had it!' sighed the old woman, still more deeply.'What! haven't you got a cow?'"
the-sea-king-gift,5,"Maie was silent. This question so struck her to the heart that she couldnot reply.'We have no cow,' Matte answered; 'but we have good smoked herring, andcan cook them in a couple of hours.''All right, then, that will do,' said the students, as they flungthemselves down on the rock, while fifty silvery-white herring wereturning on the spit in front of the fire.'What's the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean?' askedone of them.'Ahtola,' answered the old man.'Well, you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King'sdominion.'"
the-sea-king-gift,6,"Matte did not understand. He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing ofthe sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him.'Ahti,' said they, 'is a mighty king who lives in his dominion ofAhtola, and has a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possesses besides atreasury of good things. He rules over all fish and animals of the deep;he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grassat the bottom of the ocean. He who stands well with Ahti is soon a richman, but one must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changefuland touchy. Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him,and then as he takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a stormand drags the sailors down into the depths. Ahti owns also the fairestmaidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound ofmusic they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.''Oh!' cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?''We have as good as seen it,' said the students. 'It is all printed in abook, and everything printed is true.''I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head."
the-sea-king-gift,7,"But the herring were now ready, and the students ate enough for six,and gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat.Prince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat.When all was finished, the students handed Matte a shining silver coin,and allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco. Theythen thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey,much regretted by Prince, who sat with a woeful expression and whined onthe shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat's white sail in thedistance.Maie had never uttered a word, but thought the more. She had good ears,and had laid to heart the story about Ahti. 'How delightful,' thoughtshe to herself, 'to possess a fairy cow! How delicious every morning andevening to draw milk from it, and yet have no trouble about the feeding,and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets! Butthis will never be my luck.'"
the-sea-king-gift,8,"'What are you thinking of?' asked Matte.'Nothing,' said his wife; but all the time she was pondering over somemagic rhymes she had heard in her childhood from an old lame man, whichwere supposed to bring luck in fishing.'What if I were to try?' thought she.Now this was Saturday, and on Saturday evenings Matte never set theherring-net, for he did not fish on Sunday. Towards evening, however,his wife said:'Let us set the herring-net just this once.'"
the-sea-king-gift,9,"'No,' said her husband, 'it is a Saturday night.''Last night was so stormy, and we caught so little,' urged his wife;'to-night the sea is like a mirror, and with the wind in this directionthe herring are drawing towards land.''But there are streaks in the north-western sky, and Prince was eatinggrass this evening,' said the old man.'Surely he has not eaten my garlic,' exclaimed the old woman.'No; but there will be rough weather by to-morrow at sunset,' rejoinedMatte.'Listen to me,' said his wife, 'we will set only one net close to theshore, and then we shall be able to finish up our half-filled cask,which will spoil if it stands open so long.'"
the-sea-king-gift,10,"The old man allowed himself to be talked over, and so they rowed outwith the net. When they reached the deepest part of the water, she beganto hum the words of the magic rhyme, altering the words to suit thelonging of her heart:          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,          Finest treasures have I heard,               And glittering fish belong to thee.          The richest pearls beyond compare,               Are stored up in thy realm below,          And Ocean's cows so sleek and fair,               Feed on the grass in thy green meadow.          King of the waters, far and near,               I ask not of thy golden store,          I wish not jewels of pearl to wear,               Nor silver either, ask I for,          But one is odd and even is two,               So give me a cow, sea-king so bold,          And in return I'll give to you,               A slice of the moon, and the sun's gold.'What's that you're humming?' asked the old man."
the-sea-king-gift,11,"'Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,'answered the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on:          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,          A thousand cows are in thy herd,               I pray thee give one onto me.'That's a stupid sort of song,' said Matte. 'What else should one beg ofthe sea-king but fish? But such songs are not for Sunday.'His wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune allthe time they were on the water. Matte heard nothing more as he sat androwed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the finetobacco. Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed.But neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; the one thought of how hehad profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti's cow."
the-sea-king-gift,12,"About midnight the fisherman sat up, and said to his wife:'Dost thou hear anything?''No,' said she.'I think the twirling of the weathercock on the roof bodes ill,' saidhe; 'we shall have a storm.''Oh, it is nothing but your fancy,' said his wife.Matte lay down, but soon rose again.'The weathercock is squeaking now,' said he.'Just fancy! Go to sleep,' said his wife; and the old man tried to.For the third time he jumped out of bed.'Ho! how the weather-cock is roaring at the pitch of its voice, as if ithad a fire inside it! We are going to have a tempest, and must bring inthe net.'"
the-sea-king-gift,13,"Both rose. The summer night was as dark as if it had been October, theweather-cock creaked, and the storm was raging in every direction. Asthey went out the sea lay around them as white as now, and the spraywas dashing right over the fisher-hut. In all his life Matte had neverremembered such a night. To launch the boat and put to sea to rescue thenet was a thing not to be thought of. The fisherman and his wife stoodaghast on the doorstep, holding on fast by the doorpost, while the foamsplashed over their faces.'Did I not tell thee that there is no luck in Sunday fishing?' saidMatte sulkily; and his wife was so frightened that she never even oncethought of Ahti's cows.As there was nothing to be done, they went in. Their eyes were heavy forlack of slumber, and they slept as soundly as if there had not been sucha thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling.When they awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, the tempest had cased,and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the redrock."
the-sea-king-gift,14,"'What can that be?' said the old woman, as she peeped out of the door.'It looks like a big seal,' said Matte.'As sure as I live, it's a cow!' exclaimed Maie. And certainly it was acow, a fine red cow, fat and flourishing, and looking as if it had beenfed all its days on spinach. It wandered peacefully up and down theshore, and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts ofgrass, as if it despised such fare.Matte could not believe his eyes. But a cow she seemed, and a cow shewas found to be; and when the old woman began to milk her, every pitcherand pan, even to the baler, was soon filled with the most deliciousmilk.The old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there, andsallied forth to seek for his lost net. He had not proceeded far when hefound it cast up on the shore, and so full of fish that not a mesh wasvisible."
the-sea-king-gift,15,"'It is all very fine to possess a cow,' said Matte, as he cleaned thefish; 'but what are we going to feed her on?''We shall find some means,' said his wife; and the cow found the meansherself. She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in greatabundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition. Every onePrince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; but Prince barkedat her, for he had now got a rival.From that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and everynet was filled with fish. Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living,and daily became richer. She churned quantities of butter, and he hiredtwo men to help him in his fishing. The sea lay before him like a bigfish tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; and the cowcontinued to fend for herself. In autumn, when Matte and Maie wentashore, the cow went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to therock, there she stood awaiting them."
the-sea-king-gift,16,"'We shall require a better house,' said Maie the following summer; 'theold one is too small for ourselves and the men.''Yes,' said Matte. So he built a large cottage, with a real lock to thedoor, and a store-house for fish as well; and he and his men caught suchquantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon, herring, and cod toRussian and Sweden.'I am quite overworked with so many folk,' said Maie; 'a girl to help mewould not come amiss.''Get one, then,' said her husband; and so they hired a girl.Then Maie said: 'We have too little milk for all these folk. Now thatI have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look afterthree cows.''All right, then,' said her husband, somewhat provoked, 'you can sing asong to the fairies.'"
the-sea-king-gift,17,"This annoyed Maie, but nevertheless she rowed out to sea on Sunday nightand sang as before:          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,          A thousand cows are in thy herd,               I pray thee give three unto me.The following morning, instead of one, three cows stood on the island,and they all ate seaweed and fended for themselves like the first one."
the-sea-king-gift,18,"'Art thou satisfied now?' said Matte to his wife.'I should be quite satisfied,' said his wife, 'if only I had twoservants to help, and if I had some finer clothes. Don't you know that Iam addressed as Madam?''Well, well,' said her husband. So Maie got several servants and clothesfit for a great lady.'Everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwellingfor summer. You might build us a two-storey house, and fetch soil tomake a garden. Then you might make a little arbour up there to letus have a sea-view; and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of anevening, and a little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather.''Anything more?' asked Matte; but he did everything that his wifewished. The rock Ahtola became so grand and Maie so grand that all thesea-urchins and herring were lost in wonderment. Even Prince was fedon beefsteaks and cream scones till at last he was as round as a butterjar.'Are you satisfied now?' asked Matte.'I should be quite satisfied,' said Maie, 'if only I had thirty cows. Atleast that number is required for such a household.''Go to the fairies,' said Matte."
the-sea-king-gift,19,"His wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea-king. Nextmorning thirty cows stood on the shore, all finding food for themselves.'Know'st thou, good man, that we are far too cramped on this wretchedrock, and where am I to find room for so many cows?''There is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea.''Rubbish!' said his wife. 'Who can pump out the sea?''Try with thy new steamer, there is a pump in it.'Maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her, but stillher mind was set upon the same subject. 'I never could pump the seaout,' thought she, 'but perhaps I might fill it up, if I were to makea big dam. I might heap up sand and stones, and make our island as bigagain.'"
the-sea-king-gift,20,"Maie loaded her boat with stones and went out to sea. The fiddler waswith her, and fiddled so finely that Ahti and Wellamos and all the sea'sdaughters rose to the surface of the water to listen to the music.'What is that shining so brightly in the waves?' asked Maie.'That is sea foam glinting in the sunshine,' answered the fiddler.'Throw out the stones,' said Maie.The people in the boat began to throw out the stones, splash, splash,right and left, into the foam. One stone hit the nose of Wellamos'schief lady-in-waiting, another scratched the sea queen herself on thecheek, a third plumped close to Ahti's head and tore off half of thesea-king's beard; then there was a commotion in the sea, the wavesbubbled and bubbled like boiling water in a pot"
the-sea-king-gift,21,"'Whence comes this gust of wind?' said Maie; and as she spoke the seaopened and swallowed up the steamer. Maie sank to the bottom like astone, but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface,where she found the fiddler's fiddle, and used it as a float. At thesame moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and hehad only half a beard!'Why did you throw stones at me?' roared the sea-king.'Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! Put some bear's grease on yourbeard and that will soon make it grow again.''Dame, did I not give you all you asked for--nay, even more?''Truly, truly, your majesty. Many thanks for the cows.''Well, where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon thatyou promised me?''Ah, your majesty, they have been scattered day and night upon the sea,except when the sky was overcast,' slyly answered Maie.'I'll teach you!' roared the sea-king; and with that he gave the fiddlesuch a 'puff' that it sent the old woman up like a sky-rocket on to herisland. There Prince lay, as famished as ever, gnawing the carcase ofa crow. There sat Matte in his ragged grey jacket, quite alone, on thesteps of the old hut, mending a net."
the-sea-king-gift,22,"'Heavens, mother,' said he, 'where are you coming from at such awhirlwind pace, and what makes you in such a dripping condition?'Maie looked around her amazed, and said, 'Where is our two-storeyhouse?''What house?' asked her husband.'Our big house, and the flower garden, and the men and the maids, andthe thirty beautiful cows, and the steamer, and everything else?''You are talking nonsense, mother,' said he. 'The students have quiteturned your head, for you sang silly songs last evening while we wererowing, and then you could not sleep till early morning. We had stormyweather during the night, and when it was past I did not wish to wakenyou, so rowed out alone to rescue the net.''But I've seen Ahti,' rejoined Maie.'You've been lying in bed, dreaming foolish fancies, mother, and then inyour sleep you walked into the water.''But there is the fiddle,' said Maie.'A fine fiddle! It is only an old stick. No, no, old woman, another timewe will be more careful. Good luck never attends fishing on a Sunday.'"
the-wee-bannock,1,"""Some tell about their sweethearts,      How they tirled them to the winnock,    But I'll tell you a bonnie tale      About a guid oatmeal bannock."""
the-wee-bannock,2,"There was once an old man and his wife, who lived in a dear littlecottage by the side of a burn. They were a very canty and contentedcouple, for they had enough to live on, and enough to do. Indeed, they considered themselves quite rich, for, besides their cottage and their garden, they possessed two sleek cows, five hens and a cock, an old cat, and two kittens.The old man spent his time looking after the cows, and the hens, and the garden; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning.One day, just after breakfast, the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening, so she took down her bakeboard, and put on her girdle, and baked a couple of fine cakes, and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden."
the-wee-bannock,3,"While they were toasting, her husband came in from the byre, and sat down to take a rest in his great arm-chair. Presently his eyes fell on the bannocks, and, as they looked very good, he broke one through the middle and began to eat it.When the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate, so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could. And when the old woman saw it disappearing, she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her, holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other.But she was old, and the bannock was young, and it ran faster than she did, and escaped over the hill behind the house. It ran, and it ran, and it ran, until it came to a large newly thatched cottage, and, as thedoor was open, it took refuge inside, and ran right across the floor toa blazing fire, which was burning in the first room that it came to."
the-wee-bannock,4,"Now, it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor, and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross-legged on the top of a big table by the window, sewing away with all their might, while the tailor's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint.When the wee bannock came trundling across the floor, all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the Master Tailor's wife.""Hoot,"" she said, ""what a set of cowards ye be! It is but a nice weebannock. Get hold of it and divide it between you, and I'll fetch youall a drink of milk."""
the-wee-bannock,5,"So she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards, and the tailor jumped up with his great shears, and one apprentice grasped the line measure, while another took up the saucer full of pins; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock. But it dodged them round and round the fire, and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road, with one of the apprentices after it, who tried to snip it in two with his shears.It ran too quickly for him, however, and at last he stopped and wentback to the house, while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside. It trundled in at the door, and there was a weaver sitting at his loom, with his wife beside him, winding a clue of yarn."
the-wee-bannock,6,"""What's that, Tibby?"" said the weaver, with a start as the little cakeflew past him.""Oh!"" cried she in delight, jumping to her feet, ""It is a wee bannock. I wonder where it came from?""""Dinna bother your head about that, Tibby,"" said her man, ""but grip it, my woman, grip it."""
the-wee-bannock,7,"But it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock. It was in vainthat the Goodwife threw her clue at it, and that the Goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle. It dodged, and turned, and twisted, like a thing bewitched, till at last it flew out at the door again, and vanished down the hill, ""for all the world,"" as the old woman said, ""like a new tarred sheep, or a daft cow.""In the next house that it came to it found the Goodwife in the kitchen, kirning. She had just filled her kirn, and there was still some creamstanding in the bottom of her cream jar.""Come away, little bannock,"" she cried when she saw it. ""Thou art come in just the nick of time, for I am beginning to feel hungry, and I'll have cakes and cream for my dinner."""
the-wee-bannock,8,"But the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn, and the Goodwife after it. And she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn; and by the time that she had put it right again, the wee bannock was out at the door and half-way down the brae to the mill.The miller was sifting meal in the trough, but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake.""It's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them,"" he said; ""but I like bannocks and cheese, so just come in, and I will give thee a night's lodging."""
the-wee-bannock,9,"But the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller, so it turned and ran out of the mill, and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it.After this it ran on, and on, and on, till it came to the smithy, andit popped in there to see what it could see.The smith was busy at the anvil making horse-shoe nails, but he looked up as the wee bannock entered."
the-wee-bannock,10,"""If there be one thing I am fond of, it is a glass of ale and awell-toasted cake,"" he cried. ""So come inside here, and welcome to you.""But as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale, it turned and ranout of the smithy as fast as it could, and the disappointed smith pickedup his hammer and ran after it. And when he saw that he could not catchit, he flung his heavy hammer at it, in the hope of knocking it down,but, luckily for the little cake, he missed his aim.After this the bannock came to a farmhouse, with a great stack of peatsstanding at the back of it. In it went, and ran to the fireside. In thishouse the master had all the lint spread out on the floor, and wascloving it with an iron rod, while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven."
the-wee-bannock,11,"""Oh, Janet,"" cried the Goodman in surprise, ""here comes in a littlebannock. It looks rare and good to eat. I'll have one half of it.""""And I'll have the other half,"" cried the Goodwife. ""Hit it over theback with your cloving-stick, Sandy, and knock it down. Quick, or itwill be out at the door again.""But the bannock played ""jook-about,"" and dodged behind a chair. ""Hoot!"" cried Janet contemptuously, for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it, and she threw her heckle at it.But the heckle missed it, just as her husband's cloving-rod had done, for it played ""jook-about"" again, and flew out of the house."
the-wee-bannock,12,"This time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standingamong the heather.Here the Goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire, and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow.""Oh, Jock! come here, come here,"" cried the Goodwife. ""You are crying for a little bannock for your supper; come here, histie, quick, and help me to catch it.""""Ay, ay,"" assented Jock, jumping to his feet and hurrying across thelittle room. ""But where is it? I cannot see it.""""There, man, there,"" cried his wife, ""under that chair. Run thou to that side; I will keep to this."""
the-wee-bannock,13,"So Jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair; but, in his hurry, he tripped and fell, and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door.Through the whins and up the hillside it ran, and over the top of thehill, to a shepherd's cottage on the other side.The inmates were just sitting down to their porridge, and the Goodwife was scraping the pan.""Save us and help us,"" she exclaimed, stopping with the spoon half-way to her mouth. ""There's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at ourfireside.""""Sneck the door,"" cried the husband, ""and we'll try to catch it. Itwould come in handy after the porridge."""
the-wee-bannock,14,"But the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit. It turned andran as fast as it could, and the shepherd and his wife and all thebairns ran after it, with their spoons in their hands, in hopes ofcatching it.And when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could, he threw his bonnet at it, and almost struck it; but it escaped all these dangers, and soon it came to another house, where the folk were just going to bed.The Goodman was half undressed, and the Goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire."
the-wee-bannock,15,"""What's that?"" said he, ""for the bowl of brose that I had at supper-time wasn't very big.""

""Catch it, then,"" answered his wife, ""and I'll have a bit, too. Quick!
quick! Throw your coat over it or it will be away.""

So the Goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock,and almost managed to smother it; but it struggled bravely, and got out,breathless and hot, from under it. Then it ran out into the grey light again, for night was beginning to fall, and the Goodman ran out after it, without his coat. He chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field, and in amongst a fine patch of whins. Then he lost it; and, as he was feeling cold without his coat, he went home."
the-wee-bannock,16,"As for the poor little bannock, it thought that it would creep under awhin bush and lie there till morning, but it was so dark that it neversaw that there was a fox's hole there. So it fell down the fox's hole,and the fox was very glad to see it, for he had had no food for twodays.""Oh, welcome, welcome,"" he cried; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth, and that was the end of the poor wee bannock.And if a moral be wanted for this tale, here it is: That people shouldnever be too uplifted or too cast down over anything, for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock, and, lo and behold! the fox got it after all."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,1,"Once upon a time there was a fisherman, who lived near the king's
castle, and caught fish for the king's table. One day when he had gone
fishing, he could not catch a thing. Try as he might, no matter how he
baited or flung, not the tiniest fish would bite; but when this had gone
on for a while, a head rose from the water and said: ""If you will give
me the first new thing that has come into your house, you shall catch
fish a-plenty!"" Then the man agreed quickly, for he could think of no
new thing that might have come into the house. So he caught fish all day
long, and as many as he could wish for, as may well be imagined."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,2,"But when he got home, he found that heaven had sent him a little son, the
first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise.
And when he told his wife about it, she began to weep and wail, and pray
to God because of the vow her husband had made. And the woman's grief
was reported at the castle, and when it came to the king's ears, and he
learned the reason, he promised to take the boy and see if he could not
save him. And so the king took him and brought him up as though he were
his own son, until he was grown. Then one day the boy asked whether he
might not go out fishing with his father, he wanted to so very much,
said he. The king would not hear of it; but at last he was given
permission, so he went to his father, and everything went well all day
long, until they came home in the evening."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,3,"Then the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief, and went down to the boat to get it. But no sooner was he in the boat than it moved off with a rush, and no matter how hard the youth worked against it with the oars, it was all in vain. The boat drove on and on, all night long, and at last he came to a white strand, far, far away. He stepped ashore, and after he had gone a while he met an old man with a great, white beard. ""What is this country called?"" asked the youth. ""Whiteland,"" was the man's answer, and he asked the youth where he came from, and what he wanted, and the latter told him. ""If you keep right on along the shore,"" said the man, ""you will come to three princesses, buried in the earth so that only their heads show. Then the first will call you--and she is the oldest--and beg you very hard to come to her and help her; and the next will do the same; but you must go to neither of them; walk quickly past them, and act as though you neither saw nor heard them. But go up to the third, and do what she asks of you, for then you will make your fortune."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,4,"When the youth came to the first princess, she called out to him, and
begged him most earnestly to come to her; but he went on as though he
had not seen her. And he passed the next one in the same manner; but
went over to the third. ""If you will do what I tell you to, you shall
have whichever one of us you want,"" said she. Yes, he would do what she
wanted. So she told him that three trolls had wished them into the earth
where they were; but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle he saw
on the edge of the forest."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,5,"""Now you must go to the castle, and let the trolls whip you one night
through for each one of us,"" said she, ""and if you can hold out, you
will have delivered us."" ""Yes,"" said the youth, he could manage that.
""When you go in,"" added the princess, ""you will find two lions standing
by the door; but if you pass directly between them, they will do you no
harm. Go on into a dark little room and lie down, and then the troll
will come and beat you; but after that you must take the bottle that
hangs on the wall, and anoint yourself where he has beaten you, and you
will be whole again. And take the sword that hangs beside the bottle,
and kill the troll with it."" He did as the princess had told him, passed
between the lions as though he did not see them, and right into the
little room, where he lay down. The first night a troll with three heads
and three whips came, and beat the youth badly; but he held out, and
when the troll had finished, he took the bottle and anointed himself,
grasped the sword and killed the troll. When he came out in the morning
the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists. The next night
it was the same; but the troll who came this time had six heads and six
whips, and beat him worse than the first one."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,6,"But when he came out in the morning, the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles. The third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips, and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted. Then the troll took him and flung him against the wall, and as he did so the bottle fell down, and its whole contents poured over the youth, and he was at once sound and whole again. Then he did not delay, but grasped the sword, killed the troll, and when he came out in the morning, the princesses were entirely out of the ground. So he chose the youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with her in peace and happiness.

But at last he was minded to travel home, and see how his parents fared.
This did not suit his queen; but since he wanted to go so badly, and
finally was on the point of departure, she said to him: ""One thing you
must promise me, that you will only do what your father tells you to do,
but not what your mother tells you to do."" And this he promised. Then
she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the
one who wore it. So he wished himself home, and his parents could not
get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,7,"When he had been home a few days, his mother wanted him to go up to the
castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be. His father said:
""No, he had better not do that, for we will have to do without him in
the meantime."" But there was no help for it, the mother begged and
pleaded until he went. When he got there he was more splendidly dressed
and fitted out than the other king. This did not suit the latter, and he
said: ""You can see what my queen looks like, but I cannot see yours; and
I do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine."" ""God grant she were
standing here, then you would see soon enough!"" said the young king, and
there she stood that very minute. But she was very sad, and said to him:
""Why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father? Now I must
go straight home, and you have used up both of your wishes."" With that
she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself
home."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,8,"Then the young king grew very sad, and went about day in, day out, with
no other thought than getting back to his queen. ""I must try and see
whether I cannot find out where Whiteland is,"" thought he, and wandered
forth into the wide world. After he had gone a while he came to a
hill; and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the
forest--for they came when he blew his horn--and him the king asked
where Whiteland was. ""That I do not know,"" said he, ""but I will ask my
beasts."" Then he called them up with his horn, and asked whether any of
them knew where Whiteland might be; but none of them knew anything about it.

Then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes. ""If you stand in them,"" said
he, ""you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on.
He is the lord of the birds of the air. Ask him. When you have found
him, turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way, and they
will come back home of their own accord."" When the king got there, he
turned the snowshoes around, as the lord of the beasts had told him, and
they ran home again. He asked about Whiteland, and the man called up
all the birds with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where
Whiteland might be. But none of them knew. Long after the rest an old
eagle came along; and he had been out for some ten years, but did not
know either."
three-princesses-in-whiteland,9,"""Well,"" said the man, ""I will lend you a pair of snowshoes. When you
stand in them you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles
further on. He is the lord of all the fishes in the sea. Ask him. But do
not forget to turn the snowshoes around again."" The king thanked him,
stepped into the snowshoes, and when he came to the one who was lord of
all the fishes in the sea, he turned them around, and they ran back like
the others. There he once more asked about Whiteland.

The man called up his fishes with his horn, but none of them knew
anything about it. At last there came an old, old carp, whom he had
called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble. When he asked
him, he said: ""Yes, I know it well, for I was cook there for fully ten
years. To-morrow I have to go back again, because our queen, whose king
has not come home again, is going to marry some one else."" ""If such be
the case,"" said the man, ""I'll give you a bit of advice. Out there by
the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years,
fighting with each other about a hat, a cloak and a pair of boots. Any
one who has these three things can make himself invisible, and wish
himself away as far as ever he will. You might say that you would test
their possessions, and then decide their quarrel for them."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,10,"Then the king thanked him, and did as he said. ""Why do you stand there fighting till the end of time?"" said he to the brothers. ""Let me test your
possessions if I am to decide your quarrel."" That suited them; but when
he had hat, cloak and boots, he told them: ""I will give you my decision
the next time we meet!"" and with that he wished himself far away. While
he was flying through the air he happened to meet the North Wind. ""And
where are you going?"" asked the North Wind. ""To Whiteland,"" said the
king, and then he told him what had happened to him. ""Well,"" said the
North Wind, ""you are traveling a little quicker than I am; for I must
sweep and blow out every corner. But when you come to your journey's
end, stand on the steps beside the door, and then I'll tt. And when the
prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all
means, I'll just take him along with me."""
three-princesses-in-whiteland,11,"The king did as the North Wind told him. He stationed himself on the
steps; and when the North Wind came roaring and rushing up, and laid
hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook, the prince came out to
see what it was all about. But that very moment the king seized him by
the collar, and threw him out, and the North Wind took him and carried
him off. When he had borne him away, the king went into the castle. At
first the queen did not recognize him, for he had grown thin and pale
because he had wandered so long in his great distress; but when he
showed her the ring, she grew glad at heart, and then they had a wedding
which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide."
whippety-stourie,1,"I am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman, who livedin a house called Kittlerumpit, though whereabouts in Scotland the houseof Kittlerumpit stood nobody knows.Some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the DebateableLand, which, as all the world knows, was on the Borders, where the oldBorder Reivers were constantly coming and going; the Scotch stealingfrom the English, and the English from the Scotch. Be that as it may,the widowed Mistress of Kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied.For she had lost her husband, and no one quite knew what had become ofhim. He had gone to a fair one day, and had never come back again, andalthough everybody believed that he was dead, no one knew how he died.Some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist, and had beenkilled in the wars; others, that he had been taken away to serve as asailor by the press-gang, and had been drowned at sea."
whippety-stourie,2,"At any rate, his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied, for she wasleft with a little baby-boy to bring up, and, as times were bad, she hadnot much to live on.But she loved her baby dearly, and worked all day amongst her cows, andpigs, and hens, in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothesfor both herself and him.Now, on the morning of which I am speaking, she rose very early and wentout to feed her pigs, for rent-day was coming on, and she intended totake one of them, a great, big, fat creature, to the market that veryday, as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a longway towards paying her rent.And because she thought so, her heart was light, and she hummed a littlesong to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm andher baby-boy on the other."
whippety-stourie,3,"But the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reachedthe pig-stye, for there lay her cherished pig on its back, with its legsin the air and its eyes shut, just as if it were going to breathe itslast breath.""What shall I do? What shall I do?"" cried the poor woman, sitting downon a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast, heedless of the factthat she had dropped her bucket, and that the pig's-meat was runningout, and that the hens were eating it.""First I lost my husband, and now I am going to lose my finest pig. Thepig that I hoped would fetch a deal of money.""Now I must explain to you that the house of Kittlerumpit stood on ahillside, with a great fir wood behind it, and the ground sloping downsteeply in front."
whippety-stourie,4,"And as the poor young thing, after having a good cry to herself, wasdrying her eyes, she chanced to look down the hill, and who should shesee coming up it but an Old Woman, who looked like a lady born.She was dressed all in green, with a white apron, and she wore a blackvelvet hood on her head, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat over that,something like those, as I have heard tell, that the women wear inWales. She walked very slowly, leaning on a long staff, and she gave abit hirple now and then, as if she were lame.As she drew near, the young widow felt it was becoming to rise andcurtsey to the Gentlewoman, for such she saw her to be."
whippety-stourie,5,"""Madam,"" she said, with a sob in her voice, ""I bid you welcome to thehouse of Kittlerumpit, although you find its Mistress one of the mostunfortunate women in the world.""""Hout-tout,"" answered the old Lady, in such a harsh voice that the youngwoman started, and grasped her baby tighter in her arms. ""Ye have littleneed to say that. Ye have lost your husband, I grant ye, but there werewaur losses at Shirra-Muir. And now your pig is like to die--I could,maybe, remedy that. But I must first hear how much ye wad gie me if Icured him.""""Anything that your Ladyship's Madam likes to ask,"" replied the widow,too much delighted at having the animal's life saved to think that shewas making rather a rash promise.""Very good,"" said the old Dame, and without wasting any more words shewalked straight into the pig-sty."
whippety-stourie,6,"She stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes, rocking toand fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could notunderstand; at least, she could only understand four of them, and theysounded something like this:    ""Pitter-patter,    Haly water.""Then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with aliquid that looked like oil in it. She took the cork out, and droppedone of her long lady-like fingers into it; then she touched the pig onthe snout and on his ears, and on the tip of his curly tail.No sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped, and, with a grunt ofcontentment, ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast."
whippety-stourie,7,"A joyful woman was the Mistress of Kittlerumpit when she saw it do this,for she felt that her rent was safe; and in her relief and gratitude shewould have kissed the hem of the strange Lady's green gown, if shewould have allowed it, but she would not.""No, no,"" said she, and her voice sounded harsher than ever. ""Let ushave no fine meanderings, but let us stick to our bargain. I have donemy part, and mended the pig; now ye must do yours, and give me what Ilike to ask--your son.""Then the poor widow gave a piteous cry, for she knew now what she hadnot guessed before--that the Green-clad Lady was a Fairy, and a WickedFairy too, else had she not asked such a terrible thing.It was too late now, however, to pray, and beseech, and beg for mercy;the Fairy stood her ground, hard and cruel."
whippety-stourie,8,"""Ye promised me what I liked to ask, and I have asked your son; and yourson I will have,"" she replied, ""so it is useless making such a din aboutit. But one thing I may tell you, for I know well that the knowledgewill not help you. By the laws of Fairy-land, I cannot take the bairntill the third day after this, and if by that time you have found out myname I cannot take him even then. But ye will not be able to find itout, of that I am certain. So I will call back for the boy in threedays.""And with that she disappeared round the back of the pig-sty, and thepoor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone.All that day, and all the next, she did nothing but sit in her kitchenand cry, and hug her baby tighter in her arms; but on the day beforethat on which the Fairy said that she was coming back, she felt as ifshe must get a little breath of fresh air, so she went for a walk in thefir wood behind the house."
whippety-stourie,9,"Now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole, in the bottom ofwhich was a bonnie spring well, the water of which was always sweet andpure. The young widow was walking near this quarry hole, when, to herastonishment, she heard the whirr of a spinning-wheel and the sound of avoice lilting a song. At first she could not think where the sound camefrom; then, remembering the quarry, she laid down her child at a treeroot, and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees tothe edge of the hole and peeped over.She could hardly believe her eyes! For there, far below her, at thebottom of the quarry, beside the spring well, sat the cruel Fairy,dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat, spinning away as fast asshe could at a tiny spinning-wheel.And what should she be singing but--    ""Little kens our guid dame at hame,    Whippety-Stourie is my name."""
whippety-stourie,10,"The widow woman almost cried aloud for joy, for now she had learned theFairy's secret, and her child was safe. But she dare not, in case thewicked old Dame heard her and threw some other spell over her.So she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child;then, catching him up in her arms, she ran through the wood to herhouse, laughing, and singing, and tossing him in the air in such a stateof delight that, if anyone had met her, they would have been in dangerof thinking that she was mad.Now this young woman had been a merry-hearted maiden, and would havebeen merry-hearted still, if, since her marriage, she had not had somuch trouble that it had made her grow old and sober-minded before hertime; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the Fairy fora few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name."
whippety-stourie,11,"So next day, at the appointed time, she went out with her boy in herarms, and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before; andwhen she saw the old Dame coming up the hill, she crumpled up her niceclean cap, and screwed up her face, and pretended to be in greatdistress and to be crying bitterly.The Fairy took no notice of this, however, but came close up to her, andsaid, in her harsh, merciless voice, ""Good wife of Kittlerumpit, ye kenthe reason of my coming; give me the bairn.""Then the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever, andfell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy."
whippety-stourie,12,"""Oh, sweet Madam Mistress,"" she cried, ""spare me my bairn, and take, andthou wilt, the pig instead.""""We have no need of bacon where I come from,"" answered the Fairy coldly;""so give me the laddie and let me begone--I have no time to waste inthis wise.""""Oh, dear Lady mine,"" pleaded the Goodwife, ""if thou wilt not have thepig, wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself?""The Fairy stepped back a little, as if in astonishment. ""Art thou mad,woman,"" she cried contemptuously, ""that thou proposest such a thing? Whoin all the world would care to take a plain-looking, red-eyed, dowdywife like thee with them?"""
whippety-stourie,13,"Now the young Mistress of Kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty, andthe knowledge had never vexed her; but something in the Fairy's tonemade her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer.""In troth, fair Madam, I might have had the wit to know that the like ofme is not fit to tie the shoe-string of the High and Mighty Princess,WHIPPETY-STOURIE!""If there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground, and if ithad suddenly exploded beneath her feet, the Wicked Fairy could not havejumped higher into air.And when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down thebrae, shrieking with rage and disappointment, for all the world, as anold book says, ""like an owl chased by witches."""
