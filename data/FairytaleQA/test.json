' yes , that will do beautifully , ' said the first . and when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head , and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen . the father , who was sitting by the fire , thought that , in spite of her muddy clothes , he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely ; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy . ' what in the world is the matter ? ' asked the birds sleepily . ' that is our secret , ' said the doves . meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever ; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures .
